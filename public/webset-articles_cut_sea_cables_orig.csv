MTN, principal opérateur concerné  
De son côté, l’ONG Netblocks, qui surveille l’état de la connexion internet dans le monde, indique que l’Angola, le Botswana, le Gabon, la Gambie, le Mali, la Mauritanie, la Namibie, le Niger, la Zambie et le Zimbabwe ont été plus ou moins gravement concernés par la panne.

Au Congo-Brazzaville, au Nigeria, au Ghana et en Côte d’Ivoire, MTN, qui possède 11 % du WACS, a confirmé « rencontrer des problèmes affectant la connectivité due à la coupure du WACS ».

La RDC et le Cameroun parmi les pays les plus touchés  
Tributaire du WACS et de l’ACE, qui relient ses sept millions d’internautes au réseau mondial, la RDC fait partie des pays qui ont le plus souffert de l’épisode malheureux. Le trafic a repris graduellement en fin de journée, jeudi, suite à des travaux de connexion au tronçon angolais du WACS.

Le Cameroun, dont le réseau est théoriquement plus résilient grâce à la présence du câble SAT3, fait également partie des victimes. D’après Netblocks, la panne aurait grignoté 26 % des capacités de son réseau au plus fort de la crise.

Au Sénégal, « l’incident est sans aucun impact pour le trafic de la Sonatel. Le Sénégal étant sur le segment nord de SAT3 (entre le Ghana et le Portugal) et il n’y aura pas de ralentissement grâce à ces investissements importants sur les câbles sous-marins », assure à Jeune Afrique Abdoul Ly, directeur général de l’Autorité de régulation des télécommunications et des postes.

Due to undersea fibre cable breaks off the west coast of Africa, international traffic to and from the country has slowed to a crawl.

The breaks have also made accessing services located beyond South African borders a nightmare, and one of the services affected is Twitter.

We’ve tried a number of different methods to connect to the social network, include logging in to Tweetdeck, pinging Twitter via Windows’ command line tool, and using different mobile networks and connection types. All methods have failed.

The Meme staff also tried using Opera’s browser VPN and TunnelBear for Android, with the idea that perhaps connecting to Twitter through a different server located in India or Singapore would work, but nope. Nothing.

Interestingly, we’re still receiving notifications from Twitter via the Android app, but once tapped the app refuses to load any additional content.

On Friday ISP WebAfrica noted that website loading times would be longer and packet drops would be more pronounced, and this is what we’re now seeing with Twitter.

According to DownDetector, users across South Africa are affected.

The outage aggregator is also noting issues accessing other services from South Africa, especially international gaming servers. These include Call of Duty, Apex Legends, and Rainbow Six Siege.

Still expected to leave Cape Town harbour later today, the Leon Thevenin - the cable repair ship entrusted with fixing SA’s slow internet - has an incredible more than 6,000 kilometre journey up the West Coast of Africa to near Gabon – it’s not something this 107-metre maintenance cable layer is unused to.

The vessel, which forms part of a fleet of vessels owned by Orange Marine, has been ploughing through rough oceans for over 29 years and holds a maritime record for 230 repairs on cables in the Atlantic Ocean Agreement (ACMA).

“The vessel will need about 6 days to arrive to the areas where the cables have been cut. Then, at least 48 hours will be needed to repair the cables,” Krista Limousin, Orange Group Press Office, told Business Insider South Africa.

Since 2013 its main base of operations has been out of Cape Town and it oversees the maintenance operations for the South Atlantic and Indian ocean cables. It performs a quarter of the repairs in the Atlantic Ocean out of 30 vessels operating on this contract in this area, says Orange Marine.

Commercial undersea cable communications carry over 97% of all intercontinental electronic communications.

**Here's some more about the ship tasked with bringing South Africa’s internet back online:**

Built in 1983, Leon Thevenin is a multipurpose cable ship specialising in maintenance operations. The ship is known for its speed and efficiency of her interventions, even under extreme weather conditions. At full load it can travel at 15 knots, almost 30 kilometres per hour.

Its bows are located 8 metres above the sea level allowing it to work in sea state 6, with waves up to 6 metres high. It has 73 cabins: 52 single cabins and 21 double cabins for crew. It’s equipped with traditional cable works tools – grapnels, buoys, ropes, dead-weights but also a Hector 5 Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV). Hector 5 is used for different operations on the fibre optic cables: detection, cutting, recovery, jointing and testing. The Thevenin is capable of operating repairs in very shallow waters, as well as in deep waters – between 10 and 7,000 metres. It’s been a resident in Cape Town harbour since 2013.","The article discusses the Leon Thevenin, a cable repair ship, and its mission to repair undersea cables that have been cut.

The Leon Thevenin, the cable repair ship tasked with fixing the broken undersea cables which have brought slow internet in South Africa, could complete the first set of repairs at the West African Cable System (Wacs) two days early, according to Openserve.

In conversation with the Chief of Mission on board the Leon Thevenin, Openserve said repairs are currently underway on one of the affected segments of the Wacs cable off the coast of Congo and is nearing completion.

As it stands, the vessel is due to depart to its next repair destination on 6 February 2020. This departure is 2 days earlier than originally planned, reports Openserve.

Leon Thevenin was tasked with repairing Wacs and the South Atlantic 3/West Africa (Sat-3/Wasc) which went down in the early hours of Thursday, 16 January 2020. It set sail from Cape Town on January 23 after being stuck in port due to high winds.

The previous estimated time of return was put at February 8, a work time of 11 days, state-owned telecommunications company, Broadband Infraco, said in a tweet.

Once repaired, the vessel will travel on to offshore Ghana to attend to the repair of a section of the Sat-3/Wasc with an anticipated repair completion by 17 February. And then proceed to another break location of the Sat-3/Wasc cable set to be completed around 25 February.

By Admire Moyo  
Johannesburg, 31 Mar 2020  
Byron Clatterbuck, CEO of Seacom.  
  
The breaking of the West Africa Cable System (WACS) submarine cable has resulted in the Seacom cable system carrying a large amount of South Africa’s international Internet traffic.  
So said Byron Clatterbuck, CEO of Seacom, in an e-mail interview with ITWeb yesterday.  
This as a vessel is currently on its way to fix the WACS cable, which broke over the weekend, with full restoration expected by 4 April.  
The breaking of the cable has resulted in South Africans experiencing slow Internet speeds.  
Clatterbuck says although not a direct consortium investor, Seacom is one of the largest users of the WACS cable system between SA and Europe.  
He points out Seacom uses the WACS cable system predominantly as a “protected” path for Seacom’s main data superhighway on Africa’s east coast – the Seacom cable system.  
“At a fundamental level, it means that if there is an outage on the Seacom cable system, then our customers’ Internet traffic is routed on the WACS cable system, and if there is an outage on the WACS cable system, as there is at the moment, then Internet traffic gets routed on the Seacom cable system,” says Clatterbuck.  
  
### Meshed network  
Privately-operated Seacom launched Africa’s first broadband submarine cable system along the continent’s eastern and southern coasts in 2009.  
“As Seacom is one of the largest Internet providers in Africa, we must ensure our network is affordable, reliable and of the highest quality. This means low latency or low round-trip delay, low packet loss, and data speeds that customers pay for,” says Clatterbuck.  
“To achieve this, we operate our network on a ‘meshed’ basis, meaning over multiple linear routes that are diverse from each other as best we can and, therefore, do not rely fully on any one cable path. The WACS cable system forms a core part of our meshed Internet service platform that ensures we offer an ‘always on’ and high-quality Internet experience to our customers.”  
According to Clatterbuck, the WACS cable break is affecting Seacom in two ways. “It means customers who have purchased WACS capacity from Seacom to form part of their own network backbone are now ‘hard down’ on this route, and they must be using or looking to use other routes to transmit their data traffic.  
“More importantly, it means that for Seacom’s Internet/managed services platform, we are now relying predominantly on the Seacom cable system to carry a large amount of South Africa’s international Internet traffic.”  
He adds the SAT-3 cable is also in the Seacom network backbone, but unfortunately the SAT-3 cable system is currently undergoing repairs and is not operational.  
Nonetheless, Telkom confirmed to ITWeb this morning that SAT-3 was successfully restored last night and 140GB international traffic is now available, thereby alleviating congestion.  
The SAT-3 fault was located in a similar area to a previous break in January, which was caused by a short circuit.  
“Being overly reliant on any single cable system is always a risk. However, as Seacom owns and operates the Seacom cable system itself, we are, therefore, more directly involved in its routing, repair and maintenance, giving us greater flexibility in dealing with potential outages or issues on the Seacom cable system,” Clatterbuck says.  
He adds that all Internet customers of Seacom are mitigated from the impact of the WACS outage, by being routed over the Seacom cable system as well.  
Most Seacom Internet customers will not have noticed the WACS outage, as they are routed over the Seacom cable system, he notes.  
  
### Re-routing traffic  
However, he says, some customers may notice longer latency as their traffic is now being routed across South Africa first (from Cape Town, for example) and then up the east coast of Africa on the Seacom cable system.  
“Furthermore, it has always been Seacom’s position to help the industry and our partners mitigate network impacts when there are cable breaks or outages on other systems. We offer as much restoration capacity as we can (temporary alternative path) to any ISP or network service provider that needs it, and we always take a position to price this fairly and on a short-term basis. As we are a private cable system, this does allow us to activate and provide restoration as quickly as possible to customers looking for restoration.”  
Clatterbuck points out the WACs cable system is very important to South Africa, as it is one of three key high-speed (multi-terabit) cables connecting SA.  
“Yes, there are only three! Seacom was the first to go live in 2009, followed by EASSy in 2010, and then WACS in 2012. So having only three international multi-terabit cable systems connecting all users in South Africa means it is never a good thing when one of them is down, as that pushes all the traffic to the other two. WACS is a critically important link for South Africa, particularly for customers in the Western Cape, but also as a key protection path for all South African customers in the event of any subsea cable outages on Africa’s east coast.”  
He also explains that many ISPs in SA are heavily reliant on the WACS cable system, as the system is a low-cost high-speed system that connects Africa to Europe on a low-latency routing.  
“Each ISP would have its own network design that might include transmission routes on WACS, EASSy, SAT-3 and the Seacom cable system to provide their customers with an Internet service.  
“If an ISP was using WACS for more than half their traffic routing, however, then their customers are likely facing congestion and poor Internet quality. We have seen reports that some of Africa’s biggest consumer ISPs are now using Seacom’s service to provide restoration and improved quality during this WACS outage.  
“It is particularly critical for customers at home to have a reliable Internet service during this period of national disaster in South Africa due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and Seacom hopes all international cable systems remain stable going forward,” Clatterbuck concludes.","The article titled ""Seacom carries extra traffic as WACS outage continues"" discusses the breaking of the West Africa Cable System (WACS) submarine cable and its significant implications for internet connectivity in South Africa.

It directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables by detailing the WACS cable break, the resulting slow internet speeds for South Africans, and how Seacom is managing the rerouting of traffic to mitigate these effects.

The CEO of Seacom, Byron Clatterbuck, emphasizes the critical nature of the WACS cable for South Africa's internet infrastructure and the reliance on it by various ISPs.

Seacom CEO Byron Clatterbuck.  
Deemed an “essential service”, submarine cable operator Seacom has laid bare its plans to navigate the COVID-19 lockdown and the breaking of the West Africa Cable System (WACS) cable to mitigate impact on the business.  
In an e-mail interview with ITWeb, Seacom CEO Byron Clatterbuck says the company is as exposed to the economic impact of the lockdown as the rest of the businesses in the South African economy.  
Besides the COVID-19 lockdown, Seacom was also impacted by the breaking of the WACS undersea cable system which resulted in Seacom carrying a large amount of South Africa’s international Internet traffic.  
Seacom uses the WACS cable system predominantly as a “protected” path for Seacom’s main data superhighway on Africa’s east coast – the Seacom cable system.  
It is expected the WACS cable will be fully restored tomorrow.  
Seacom launched Africa’s first broadband submarine cable system along the continent’s eastern and southern coasts in 2009.  
Through its ownership of Africa’s most extensive ICT data infrastructure – including multiple subsea cables and a continent-wide IP-MPLS network – Seacom provides communications and cloud solutions that enable the growth of the continent’s economy.  
Although Seacom recently said it is upgrading its subsea cable systems’ lit capacity from 1.5TB to 3TB this year, the company is expecting more competition in the submarine cable business with new players set to enter the fray.  
Google will launch its Equiano cable that will connect Africa with Europe. Once complete, Equiano will start in Western Europe and run along the west coast of Africa, between Portugal and SA, with branching units along the way that can be used to extend connectivity to additional African countries.  
Social media giant Facebook will also encircle Africa with its own cable system, dubbed Simba.  
“The entire telecoms industry has been deemed an ‘essential service’ by the South African government. Seacom has applied for, and been granted, its ‘essential service’ status,” Clatterbuck says.  
“We have changed our way of work – staff are now working from home with the focus of keeping our business running by supplying good quality Internet and connectivity solutions, while keeping up our industry-leading service levels,” he notes.  
Clatterbuck adds that equally as important as keeping the Seacom business running well from an operation point of view, the company also understands the lockdown is affecting all its customers.  
“As Seacom is one of the largest Internet providers in Africa, we are ensuring our network is reliable and of the highest quality – especially at a time like this when connectivity is paramount.”  
He adds that team meetings are continuing, and most teams continue with their daily stand-ups. “We realise, as I am sure most other organisations do, that frequent communication during this time is key to business success and continuity.”  
On how the lockdown will impact on revenue, Clatterbuck says: “We are a part of the South African economy and, thus, are feeling the impact of the pandemic on our business. It is too soon to be able to quantify the impact on our revenue, but we remain committed to keeping Africa connected.”  
According to Clatterbuck, Seacom has also seen a noticeable increase in its network traffic since the lockdown began.  
“This is expected and we are pleased to have enough spare capacity across our network components to accommodate the increased demand,” he says.  
“Seacom has a complete business continuity plan and has activated components of this plan in the current lockdown scenario. If there’s anything we can all learn from COVID-19, it’s that nothing can be fully predicted. It is, therefore, imperative to plan for ‘everything’; the world’s greatest leaders will tell you that planning is key to business continuity.”

A working theory, according to SARen, is that the cable short-circuited due to intense pressure from being trapped under heavy sediment carried by the flow of turbulent waters from the Congo River into the submarine canyon where the cable runs.  

Heavy rains caused the Congo River to overflow in recent weeks. The theory would also explain why both the Wacs and the Sat-3/Wasc cables went down at the same time in the early hours of 16 January 2020 - both faults are reported to have occurred in this same region.  

The Leon Thevenin is presumably now making its way to its next destination – the site of the other big cable break in the area, on the South Atlantic 3/West Africa (Sat-3/Wasc) system. Wacs is still not operational.

No estimated time for repair, says Afrihost
-------------------------------------------

South African ISP Afrihost detailed the current repair efforts in a verbose [Status Page update](https://www.afrihost.com/site/network_status) on Sunday afternoon.

“Our upstream providers report that adverse weather in the Western Cape has delayed the departure of the ship to effect repairs to international undersea cables. We currently do not have an ETR for final repairs to be completed,” it wrote.

It explained that some services, like international gaming servers and Twitter — which was [down across South Africa for most of the weekend](https://memeburn.com/2020/01/twitter-south-africa-down/) — have been “optimised for best performance” as the ISP rerouted traffic via alternative cables.

TENET added that the alternative route is provided by the SEACOM and EASSy cables, which land on South Africa’s eastern coastline, but this will affect load times for those on the western areas of the country.

The alternative routes however do not have sufficient capacity to meet demand, Afrihost added, so it’s likely that South Africans will still experience slow internet access for quite some time.

There’s also no estimated time of repair, while it’s not clear when the ship will be dispatched.

Rain and windy weather is set to remain over Cape Town on Sunday, finally clearing by Monday.

Voice and data networks have been poor in Nigeria recently, and one of the telecommunication companies having a tough time in resolving the network issue is **MTN Nigeria**.

**Reacting to the growing inquiries of its subscribers, stated** “This situation is affecting all operators and customers in the region.

**MTN not to blame?** It was learnt that the network issue is beyond Nigeria, as internet users across sub-Saharan Africa are also experiencing the same issue. The slow service is due to damages of two undersea cables – WACS and SAT3/WASC cable systems – on the continent’s western coast.

_*This is a developing story._*

In a freak occurrence, two key undersea cables that connect South Africa to the global internet have both been hit by separate failures – resulting in very slow internet speeds for some users since Thursday.

The South Atlantic 3/West Africa (SAT-3/Wasc) submarine cable, which links Portugal and Spain to South Africa, with connections to several West African countries along the way, has been hit by a breakdown near Libreville, Gabon, internet service provider Axxess reported this morning.

Meanwhile the West Africa Cable System (Wacs), which links South Africa with the United Kingdom, also along the west coast of Africa, saw an outage off the coast of Congo.

This has resulted in some South African internet users experiencing excruciatingly slow speeds since Thursday.

""The unusual and simultaneous dual cable break has resulted in customers, that are connected to Openserve’s global capacity clients, experiencing reduced speed on international browsing. International voice calling and mobile roaming has also been impacted,"" Openserve said in a statement on Thursday.

""Openserve appreciates the patience of all affected clients and their customers as undersea cable infrastructure repairs are complex and can be time consuming.""

On Friday morning, internet service provider Afrihost told users that connections are being re-routed, but that it still had no estimate on when normal service would resume.

By Nicola Mawson, Contributor.  
Johannesburg, 25 Mar 2013  
Undersea cable company Seacom is working on restoring connectivity to transmission customers across the Mediterranean Sea, apparently after a cable break towards the end of last week off the Egyptian shore.  
The company says it has optimised the IP network to relieve congestion where it can and will update end-users as soon as further information becomes available. It has not provided a timeframe for when the connection will be restored.  
However, according to @MWEBGuy, MWeb's technical Twitter contact, ""Early indications are that it may take up to two weeks to repair the break and restore full capacity."" The cable has been down since Friday.  
Seacom launched the first undersea fibre-optic cable, to connect Southern and Eastern Africa with Europe and Asia, in July 2009. The cable connects SA, Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya and Djibouti with the rest of the world via landing points in France (and onwards to London) and India.  
On Saturday, CEO Mark Simpson sent out a message saying multiple cable systems continue to be affected across Africa, the Middle East and Asia.  
@MWEBGuy says the Internet service provider (ISP) is currently trying to source additional capacity. The social media face of the ISP was responding to queries from subscribers about slow or no Internet service posted on Twitter.  
Internet Solutions has also experienced problems as a result of the outage, with its Twitter account indicating it has rerouted traffic and added bandwidth, but some people may experience latency. It does not give a timeframe for resolution.  
### Work in progress  
Simpson says the exact root cause is not likely to be known until the cable is repaired in the coming week or two, and the damaged section is recovered from the seabed and inspected. ""I know that many of you are keen to know the cause of the outage is a physical cable cut some kilometres north of the coast of Egypt in the Mediterranean Sea.""  
Seacom suspects, based on its experience with sub-sea systems and the nature of the sea area where the cut has occurred, that ""the most likely cause is external aggression to the cable, most probably caused by a larger vessel dragging its anchor across the seabed"".  
This is a common cause of damage to cable systems globally, despite continued efforts to protect the cable with armour, burying, notifications to ships of cable location and exclusion zones, notes Simpson.  
Simpson says the Seacom team remains committed to getting restoration services up. ""However, this process is proving much more complex and taking longer than we were initially told by our suppliers and would have expected.""  
Seacom continues to push for activation as a priority, coordinating across a number of carriers internationally, says Simpson. ""However, as this is not providing solutions in the timeframe we require, we are also actively seeking new restoration solutions. This will continue to take some time and we are not able to provide timeframes as yet on when services will be restored.","The article 'Seacom suffers cable break' provides a thorough discussion about a break in an undersea cable, including direct references to 'undersea cable' and 'cable break.' It details the implications for internet connectivity across various regions and the efforts being made to restore services.

The discussion includes the causes of the cable cut and its effects on multiple cable systems, confirming that the article treats the topic as central rather than a minor mention."

Head of Seacom Business Grant Parker says Cape Town and Durban are prime growth opportunities for the company.  
Following the launch of Seacom Business last year, the undersea cable operator has moved to introduce its high-speed bandwidth solutions for businesses in Durban and Cape Town.  
In 2015, the fibre operator introduced Seacom Business in Gauteng, offering connectivity to corporate clients, either directly or through channel partners.  
Seacom Business will allow customers along the coast to access connectivity and cloud services, it says.  
Business customers in Cape Town and Durban metropolitan areas will be able to buy high-speed bandwidth solutions directly from Seacom Business and through its resellers, according to Seacom.  
""We initially launched in Gauteng, supported by the Johannesburg office, where we have enjoyed great success in the enterprise market to date. Rolling out in Cape Town and Durban - the next largest metros in SA - is a natural next step for us. We have had some success on the coast, but want to turn up the volume a bit with a dedicated team in the regions to service customers' needs,"" says Grant Parker, head of Seacom Business.  
Seacom Business has also placed sales teams in Durban and Cape Town to service demand, and established channel partnerships with ICT resellers, service providers and systems integrators active on the coast.  
""With feet on the ground, we will be able to penetrate the market more rapidly. We'll be able to offer a more personal touch to our clients. The expansion will also enhance our client experience by giving our national clients the ability to connect to all major cities throughout South Africa,"" says Parker.  
He adds: ""Clients in these markets have welcomed the launch of Seacom Business and we are already seeing early adopters embrace our services and products. Cape Town and Durban are primed to be exciting growth opportunities for us. Though we were doing some business in these markets before the launch, we expect a more focused and formal approach to catalyse more growth for us.""  
Since introducing its direct-to-business offerings in Gauteng last year, Seacom Business says it has signed up an average of 60 business customers a month and has appointed more than 65 partners to support its drive into the business market.  
According to Parker, Seacom Business will expand to new territories as and when the opportunities make commercial sense.

Cable ship Leon Thevenin finally departed Cape Town Harbour last night at about 21:30 and will sail to offshore Angola where the first steps of the physical repair on damaged undersea cables – South Atlantic 3/West Africa Submarine Cable (SAT3/WASC) and the West African Cable System (WACS) – will commence.

Strong and gale force winds in the City of Cape Town last week and over the weekend delayed the operations of the cable ship.

In a statement this morning, Openserve says following delays caused by weather conditions last weekend, loading of the vessel with all gear and material required for the undersea cable repairs was completed by 17:40 yesterday.

The Leon Thevenin then set sail from South African shores with chief of mission Didier Mainguy and 53 other crew members on board. A senior representative from the WACS and SAT3 consortium forms part of the ship’s crew.

The Leon Thevenin is a French cable-laying vessel named in honour of French engineer Leon Charles Thevenin. It was famously used in conjunction with a robot submarine named Scarab 1 for recovering the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder boxes from Air India Flight 182 that was destroyed in mid-air by a bomb as it was crossing Irish airspace, on 23 June 1985.

Earlier this week, Openserve said fixing the two submarine cables that snapped simultaneously last week will be a complex task.

Since then, the Telkom subsidiary has been liaising with the WACS and SAT3/WASC undersea cable consortiums to determine the cause of the loss of service on both submarine cable systems.

The WACS and SAT3/WASC cable systems are deployed in the Atlantic Ocean and connect SA and many other African countries to Europe.

The WACS system lands in SA at Yzerfontein, Western Cape, while the SAT3/WASC system enters the country at Melkbosstrand, Western Cape.

Through continuous liaison with the technical fault investigation teams of both cable consortiums, Openserve has ascertained the SAT3/WASC break is in the Libreville, Gabon, vicinity and the WACS break point is in the vicinity of Luanda, Angola.

Openserve last week said the unusual and simultaneous dual cable break resulted in customers that are connected to Openserve’s global capacity clients experiencing reduced speed on international browsing.

International voice calling and mobile roaming were also impacted, it noted.

Telkom, through its infrastructure provisioning division Openserve, and many other South African and internationally based licensed operators hold equity in these cables.

The capacity that wholesale operators hold is sold on to Internet service providers (ISPs) and other industry players that require international connectivity.

The undersea cable systems are consortium-run and the maintenance and operations sub-committees of these consortiums are responsible for the repairs that are required for restoration of full service.

In its statement today, Openserve says weather conditions permitting, it is anticipated that the vessel will reach its first repair site on the evening of 28 January.

The vessel has been dispatched from the Cape Town Harbour, by the Maintenance and Operations Sub-Committees of the SAT3/WASC and WACS consortia due to a simultaneous dual cable break that occurred in the early hours of last Thursday, 16 January.

The breaks have resulted in South African Internet users, whose ISPs are connected to international connectivity on both or either of these cable systems, experiencing reduced speed on international browsing and in some cases increased latency.","The article titled ""Cable ship finally departs to fix broken submarine cables"" directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables.

It explicitly mentions ""submarine cables"" and discusses the simultaneous break of the South Atlantic 3/West Africa Submarine Cable (SAT3/WASC) and the West African Cable System (WACS).

The article details the repair efforts and the complexities involved, indicating significant coordination with the cable consortiums.

It also highlights the impact of the cable breaks on internet connectivity, noting reduced speeds and effects on international voice calling and mobile roaming.

The focus on these issues confirms that the topic is treated as central rather than a minor mention."

In a statement this morning, Openserve, one of the organisations affected by the cable break, says: “In the early hours of this morning (approximately 01:30) Openserve received confirmation, from aboard cable ship Leon Thevenin, that the portion of the SAT3/WASC repair offshore Congo has now been completed.”

It notes this concludes a long and complex restoration process of an unprecedented simultaneous cable break of two Atlantic Ocean-based submarine cable systems – the South Atlantic 3/West Africa Submarine Cable (SAT3/WASC) and the West African Cable System (WACS).

Openserve has since been liaising with the WACS and SAT3/WASC undersea cable consortia to determine the cause of the loss of service on both submarine cable systems.

The WACS and SAT3/WASC cable systems are deployed in the Atlantic Ocean and connect SA and many other African countries to Europe.

The WACS system lands in SA at Yzerfontein, Western Cape, while the SAT3/WASC system enters the country at Melkbosstrand, Western Cape.

This catastrophe, which caused South African Internet users reduced speed on international browsing and impacted international voice calling and mobile roaming, occurred in the early hours of 16 January.

According to Openserve, South Africans can now breathe a sigh of relief as international connectivity capacity returns to normal.

It notes the maintenance and operations sub-committees of both cable consortia had tasked their respective restoration processes to a single chief of mission on the Leon Thevinin.

The vessel departed Cape Town Harbour on the evening of Wednesday, 22 January, and has since been out on open water effecting the repair processes, at multiple break locations.

The ship will now proceed to its next location, offshore Ghana, to undertake a power-related (shunt fault) repair on the WACS cable, the Telkom subsidiary says.

It notes this fault is not affecting traffic on WACS. “If conditions allow, the entire mission is still set to be completed around 25 February, with the vessel returning to dock in Cape Town.

“In the early stages of the repair mission, Openserve’s global capacity team concluded commercial deals with several parties as a measure to minimise some of the impact on its network, and that of its clients’. As part of its internal close-out procedure the relevant teams in Openserve will, over the next few weeks, analyse the full impact of this unusual dual break on its international connectivity capacity.”

The company says this exercise will be conducted with a view to minimising, and possibly mitigating, the impact on the South African broadband ecosystem should the country find itself dealing with a similar catastrophic event in future.

Ethiopia, Sudan and Tanzania are reportedly in the midst of a major internet outage caused by cuts to the FLAG Alcatel-Lucent Optical Network (FALCON) in Yemen.  

According to reports, the cuts happened on January 9, and in a statement by Global Cloud Xchange (GCX) which manages the system, it stated that it had suffered “two major cable cuts off-shore near Port Suez.”  

The cable routes impacted include the Falcon line between Muscat and Suez and the FEA between Mumbai and Suez.  

Initial findings from the company indicate that the cause of the break was “an anchor drag by a large merchant vessel in the immediate area”. GCX has already deployed repair ships and is working to “apply for required permits.”  

The company says that the time of repair will depend on how long it takes to procure the permits.  

In the meantime, GCX says that all layer 1 traffic will remain down, and that it is working on restoring connection through various other means, such as using third part cables where possible.  

The entire Gulf region, along with a number of African countries have been affected by the internet outage, but Yemen has reportedly come off worse for wear with 80% of its internet connections down.  

The area around the Suez Canal and the Red Sea has been described by Doug Madory, Director of Internet Analysis at Oracle Internet Intelligence as ‘very shallow’, making it susceptible to anchor drops and cable cuts like this one.

**Published Date:** 02/06/2023  

Sub-Saharan Africa continued to report Internet and data access issues following accidental cuts of the undersea West Africa Cable System (WACS) that runs along the coast – and it looks as if there is no quick fix to a problem that began Thursday.

The TENET/NREN research-tech group in South Africa said a ship would be sent to the cable break near Congo, with repairs there expected over the weekend. But the cable vessel remained in Cape Town because of winds on Saturday, and then was waiting to load repair equipment late Monday.

“When the vessel has loaded and departed, the expected duration to location of the break is around six days. Fixing the break will take another week at least,” the group said in an update.

The 16,000-kilometer system runs from South Africa to the UK, connecting much of western and central Africa to Europe and each other. A second WACS break near the UK likely won’t be fixed until late January, TENET/NREN said, with complete system repairs expected in early February.

A second cable, the SAT3/WACS, also was damaged and unable to support rerouted traffic, with that break site believed to be near Libreville, the capital of Gabon.

“Further tests are being conducted by the upstream provider along with the cable consortium,” said Pro2Col Lab, based in South Africa. “There’s still no Estimated Time of Resolution.”

That’s left dozens of service providers scrambling to respond to complaints with thousands of Africans dealing with absent or slow service. Major outages were reported across all South African providers as well as in Democratic Republic of Congo. The cable system feeds terminals on the west coast that connect to interior locations and their service providers.

MTN said its service in Ghana and Nigeria was back up late Saturday, but that wasn’t the case everywhere and some customers in those countries continued to complain of slow service. In South Africa, some TENET/NREN partners were rerouted on the eastern SEACOM and EASSy cables.

The WACS Cable site itself was offline early Sunday, with no additional information on the service.","The article titled 'Ship to fix undersea cable breaks is delayed as African tech users wait' discusses significant incidents regarding the undersea West Africa Cable System (WACS) and the SAT3/WACS cable.

In February, cable ship Leon Thevenin was used to fix broken undersea cables.  
A cable vessel is on its way to fix the broken West Africa Cable System (WACS) submarine cable that is causing slow Internet speeds in SA.  
This is according to the latest reports from the RENAlerts service by SANReN and TENET. The reports say it is estimated the repair will be completed by 4 April.  
The cable break was first revealed on Saturday by the South African National Research & Education Network (SANReN), a major user of the cable, which detected the break just before midnight.  
The break came at a time when South African Internet service providers (ISPs) are reporting increased network traffic as more people are working and learning from home to curb the spreading of the coronavirus.  
Says SANReN in a tweet: “WACS Outage Update: Cable vessel, the ‘Ile D'Aix’, under way to the SV8 (Highbridge UK) side cable break. ETA at cable ground –Tue 31/03/2020 09h00 UTC. Estimated repair date: Sat 04/04/2020.”  
WACS is a submarine communications cable linking SA with the UK along the west coast of Africa that was constructed by Alcatel-Lucent.  
The cable consists of four fibre pairs and is 14 530km in length, linking from Yzerfontein in the Western Cape of SA to London in the UK.  
In January, WACS also suffered a cable break together with the SAT3/WASC cable, resulting in slow Internet speeds in SA.  
The cables were fully restored in February.  

### Contingency plans  
For the latest break, ISPs have started putting in place contingency measures to mitigate the slow speeds.  
Liquid Telecom SA, part of Pan-African telecoms group Liquid Telecom, yesterday announced it had mitigated network outages due to the unexpected loss of connectivity following a recent break in the WACS undersea cable.  
“To help ensure continuity of service, Liquid Telecom’s network traffic is automatically re-routed during such outages,” says Reshaad Sha, CEO of Liquid Telecom South Africa.  
“We are responding to new and increased demand from customers with additional capacity across alternate routes. Liquid Telecom operates a five-cable system for our international Internet capacity in South Africa. Our resilient architecture means the loss of the WACS capacity is unlikely to impact customers’ connectivity as demand surges.”  
Last year, Liquid Telecom South Africa announced its advanced core network enhancements offering customers near unlimited bandwidth capacity, says the company.  
“The replacement of our core network has not only catered to legacy performance issues but has made Liquid Telecom’s network one of the most technologically advanced, modern and reliable networks in South Africa and across the African continent. It has also addressed one of the core needs of local enterprises around network capacity,” Sha adds.  
Seacom says while repairs on the WACS undersea cable systems are being planned, many ISPs will need to re-route their traffic via alternative paths, such as Seacom’s east coast undersea cable or other routes.  
As a result of the WACS cable system issues, customers may experience increased latency as alternative routes are implemented.  
“Seacom is aware that due to issues on the WACS cable system on Africa’s west coast, many African ISPs and their customers could be experiencing unstable or slower speeds when using the Internet. Seacom’s network platform is also affected by the WACS issues, but as the Seacom cable system on Africa’s east coast is continuing to work normally, Seacom endeavours to provide ISPs that rely heavily on WACS with diverse capacity on the Seacom cable system,” the company says in a statement.  
Meanwhile, Angola Cables says: “Angola Cables has announced there has been an interruption in the supply of services on the submarine cable section of WACS which connects Seixal, Portugal to Highbridge in England.  
However, it says the services that Angola Cables provides to its customers remain operational across the 11 WACS cable contact points on the west coast of Africa.  
Data connections and access to global content and services continue to be provided – given the robustness and redundancy of the Angola Cables network, it notes.  
“As a top priority, Angola Cables and the consortium of WACS partners are working to restore the cable's full capacity to impacted customers as soon as possible.”  
Telkom unit Openserve says it has activated additional international connectivity capacity. It explains this additional capacity will alleviate and minimise impact on Openserve’s network, and that of its clients, while repairs to the WACS and SAT3/WACS cable systems continue.  
“We expect to have a full capacity when the SAT3 system comes alive tonight.”

The 10 000km cable, stretching from Sudan to SA, experienced a cut between Djibouti and Port Sudan, according to Chris Wood, chief executive of West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC), the largest shareholder in Eassy with a 30% stake.

He further says the fault has only resulted in minimal disruption owing to Eassy's collapsed ring protection system that allows for internal re-routing of traffic.

A WIOCC representative further told ITWeb that the company is currently not in a position to give an exact date for when the repair of the fault is to be completed.

“The only services affected are those either originating or terminating in Port Sudan, or those using Port Sudan to connect to other systems for transit to Europe.

“As the vast majority of Eassy's traffic exits through Djibouti, most customers have not felt the impact of the cut to Eassy,” Wood adds.

Africa's growing number of undersea cables means incidents of service disruptions, especially as a result of ships dropping anchors on cables, are increasing.

Two years ago, Africa's Seacom undersea cable, which also connects the east coast of Africa, experienced a similar cut that took almost three weeks to repair.

With more undersea broadband cables connecting Africa having come online, such as the West Africa Cable System, businesses that rely on the networks say they are mitigating service disruption risks by using a number of different cables.

Graham Beneke, systems engineer at Neology, wholesale bandwidth provider to ISPs in Africa, says the latest Eassy cut has not really affected his company's operations. “We have capacity on all the other undersea cables as well.

“By having one cable running up the east coast, and by having one cable running up the west coast, the same ship is unlikely to cause a fault on both cables simultaneously,” he adds.","The article titled ""Eassy cable damaged"" discusses the damage to the Eassy undersea broadband cable, which connects countries along Eastern Africa to high-speed internet.

Byron Clatterbuck, CEO of Seacom.  
The breaking of the West Africa Cable System (WACS) submarine cable has resulted in the Seacom cable system carrying a large amount of South Africa’s international Internet traffic.  
So said Byron Clatterbuck, CEO of Seacom, in an e-mail interview with ITWeb yesterday.  
This as a vessel is currently on its way to fix the WACS cable, which broke over the weekend, with full restoration expected by 4 April.  
The breaking of the cable has resulted in South Africans experiencing slow Internet speeds.  
Clatterbuck says although not a direct consortium investor, Seacom is one of the largest users of the WACS cable system between SA and Europe.  
He points out Seacom uses the WACS cable system predominantly as a “protected” path for Seacom’s main data superhighway on Africa’s east coast – the Seacom cable system.  
“At a fundamental level, it means that if there is an outage on the Seacom cable system, then our customers’ Internet traffic is routed on the WACS cable system, and if there is an outage on the WACS cable system, as there is at the moment, then Internet traffic gets routed on the Seacom cable system,” says Clatterbuck.  
### Meshed network  
Privately-operated Seacom launched Africa’s first broadband submarine cable system along the continent’s eastern and southern coasts in 2009.  
“As Seacom is one of the largest Internet providers in Africa, we must ensure our network is affordable, reliable and of the highest quality. This means low latency or low round-trip delay, low packet loss, and data speeds that customers pay for,” says Clatterbuck.  
“To achieve this, we operate our network on a ‘meshed’ basis, meaning over multiple linear routes that are diverse from each other as best we can and, therefore, do not rely fully on any one cable path. The WACS cable system forms a core part of our meshed Internet service platform that ensures we offer an ‘always on’ and high-quality Internet experience to our customers.”  
According to Clatterbuck, the WACS cable break is affecting Seacom in two ways. “It means customers who have purchased WACS capacity from Seacom to form part of their own network backbone are now ‘hard down’ on this route, and they must be using or looking to use other routes to transmit their data traffic.  
“More importantly, it means that for Seacom’s Internet/managed services platform, we are now relying predominantly on the Seacom cable system to carry a large amount of South Africa’s international Internet traffic.”  
He adds the SAT-3 cable is also in the Seacom network backbone, but unfortunately the SAT-3 cable system is currently undergoing repairs and is not operational.  
Nonetheless, Telkom confirmed to ITWeb this morning that SAT-3 was successfully restored last night and 140GB international traffic is now available, thereby alleviating congestion.  
The SAT-3 fault was located in a similar area to a previous break in January, which was caused by a short circuit.  
“Being overly reliant on any single cable system is always a risk. However, as Seacom owns and operates the Seacom cable system itself, we are, therefore, more directly involved in its routing, repair and maintenance, giving us greater flexibility in dealing with potential outages or issues on the Seacom cable system,” Clatterbuck says.  
He adds that all Internet customers of Seacom are mitigated from the impact of the WACS outage, by being routed over the Seacom cable system as well.  
Most Seacom Internet customers will not have noticed the WACS outage, as they are routed over the Seacom cable system, he notes.  
### Re-routing traffic  
However, he says, some customers may notice longer latency as their traffic is now being routed across South Africa first (from Cape Town, for example) and then up the east coast of Africa on the Seacom cable system.  
“Furthermore, it has always been Seacom’s position to help the industry and our partners mitigate network impacts when there are cable breaks or outages on other systems. We offer as much restoration capacity as we can (temporary alternative path) to any ISP or network service provider that needs it, and we always take a position to price this fairly and on a short-term basis. As we are a private cable system, this does allow us to activate and provide restoration as quickly as possible to customers looking for restoration.”  
Clatterbuck points out the WACs cable system is very important to South Africa, as it is one of three key high-speed (multi-terabit) cables connecting SA.  
“Yes, there are only three! Seacom was the first to go live in 2009, followed by EASSy in 2010, and then WACS in 2012. So having only three international multi-terabit cable systems connecting all users in South Africa means it is never a good thing when one of them is down, as that pushes all the traffic to the other two. WACS is a critically important link for South Africa, particularly for customers in the Western Cape, but also as a key protection path for all South African customers in the event of any subsea cable outages on Africa’s east coast.”  
He also explains that many ISPs in SA are heavily reliant on the WACS cable system, as the system is a low-cost high-speed system that connects Africa to Europe on a low-latency routing.  
“Each ISP would have its own network design that might include transmission routes on WACS, EASSy, SAT-3 and the Seacom cable system to provide their customers with an Internet service.  
“If an ISP was using WACS for more than half their traffic routing, however, then their customers are likely facing congestion and poor Internet quality. We have seen reports that some of Africa’s biggest consumer ISPs are now using Seacom’s service to provide restoration and improved quality during this WACS outage.  
“It is particularly critical for customers at home to have a reliable Internet service during this period of national disaster in South Africa due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and Seacom hopes all international cable systems remain stable going forward,” Clatterbuck concludes.","The article discusses the breaking of the West Africa Cable System (WACS) submarine cable, detailing its implications for internet traffic in South Africa.

Seacom, in an update, said it had located the outage linked to the terrestrial fibre cable in Egypt and fixed it, thereby restoring services on its network.

""The SEACOM terrestrial network was successfully repaired on the 21st January 2016 at 16:46 GMT (18:46 South African time),"" said the company.  

Meanwhile, technology website TechCentral has also reported that the West African Cable System (Wacs), which connects Yzerfontein north of Cape Town to London, has also experienced problems with a terrestrial connection in the UK.

Amid these issues, complaints of slow and inaccessible internet services in South Africa flooded social media websites such as Twitter on Thursday.

"Seacom Attributes Internet Outages to Civil Construction","Outages affecting internet connectivity across Africa due to damage to Seacom's submarine cables, with backup systems failing during the incident.","https://www.itweb.co.za/content/lP3gQ2qG4w9vnRD1","2023-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","Admire Moyo",Yes,"Admire Moyo","Rivonia, Gauteng, South Africa","10000","2023-02-06","English","ITWeb","**Seacom blames civil construction for outages**  
Seacom's submarine and terrestrial networks stretch across 17,000 km, connecting Africa to Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.  
Undersea cable operator Seacom says civil construction activity in Egypt is to blame for the multiple outages which yesterday left most of Africa without Internet connectivity.  
The company has since successfully fixed its terrestrial network which experienced the glitches in the North African country.  
According to the cable operator, the Northern Trans-Egypt route was damaged between Cairo and Alexandria, while the Southern Trans-Egypt route was damaged on the outskirts of Cairo. Both events were caused by civil construction activity, it adds.  
The outages disrupted Internet connectivity in SA as the Seacom cable links the country to East Africa and Europe.  
To exacerbate the problem, the West Africa Cable System (WACS), which Seacom uses as backup, went down at the same time, leaving most African countries without Internet connectivity.  
The Seacom network uses bundled backhaul, open access points of presence, and global partnerships to provide end-to-end wholesale connectivity around the world for African network operators.  
After deploying repair teams to monitor the situation, the cable operator last night said: ""The Seacom terrestrial network was successfully repaired on the 21st January 2016 at 16:46 GMT. Seacom would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our customers, partners, and peers for their collaboration and support during the outage.  
""During the two hours and 40 minutes that Seacom experienced a dual failure across Egypt, we were able to route Internet traffic through India.""  
However, the cable operator says many operators in Africa use a basic transmission service that links directly to Europe and use the WACS as a backup. ""With the West coast experiencing an outage at the same time, international connectivity at many of these service providers failed or was degraded while we worked to repair the faults in Egypt.""  
### New network partner  
Meanwhile, this week Seacom entered a partnership with network provider Ciena. The companies say local Internet service providers are set to benefit from the increased reach and enhanced capacity afforded by the deal.  
Both firms will deliver new network solutions with 100Gbps upgrade to service providers across Africa and into main European points of presence through key submarine links.  
""Africa is experiencing massive growth and demand for network services. With Ciena's technology supporting our infrastructure evolution, we can ensure cost-effective data connectivity to end-customers across the continent and internationally, ensuring Africa is ready for the next generation of applications and high-bandwidth broadband services,"" says Seacom chief technology officer Claes Segelberg.  
Mark Tinka, head of engineering at Seacom, says the operator's move into mainstream 100Gbps backbone technology means it will become easier to offer high-speed 1Gbps, 10Gbps, and even 100Gbps ports and services to both Seacom's IP and transport customers.  
""Seacom's existing infrastructure has more than ample capacity to support both existing and future requirements from our current and new customers. However, the per-bit unit cost of bandwidth reduces as the amount of availability and used capacity increases. Moreover, energy and space constraints mean it is more efficient to purchase 100Gbps technology instead of 10x 10Gbps, for example,"" Tinka explains.","The article titled ""Seacom blames civil construction for outages"" discusses how civil construction activities in Egypt caused damage to Seacom's submarine cable routes, specifically the Northern and Southern Trans-Egypt routes.

This damage led to significant internet outages across Africa, demonstrating the direct impact of cut sea cables on internet connectivity.

Johannesburg – Construction work in Egypt is a key reason behind fibre cuts that have disrupted internet services in South Africa twice in one week.

This is according to Claes Segelberg, who is the chief technical officer of undersea broadband cable provider Seacom.

Seacom is an undersea broadband cable that stretches along Africa’s eastern coastline to Europe via connection points in Egypt.

And on Thursday morning, an outage at around 06:00GMT (08:00 South African time) on a terrestrial network across Egypt affected Seacom's broadband connectivity to countries such as South Africa. Seacom said it expected the outage to be fixed within three hours.

This latest outage followed a similar disruption last week on Thursday January 21 when civil construction activity outside Cairo damaged the Northern Trans-Egypt and Southern Trans-Egypt fibre routes, Seacom said at the time. An outage on the West Africa Cable System (Wacs) also compounded South Africa’s internet connectivity issues on January 21.

Amid the latest outage, Seacom is blaming the same construction area in Egypt for the disruption to its broadband network.

""We are now rerouting our paths to get away from this construction area in order to stabilise that path. We're also firing up some more capacity on other systems to get other routes through Egypt,” Segelberg told Fin24.

""It's pretty much about a couple of kilometres worth of construction going along these two particular highways, if you may. So, it's pretty much the same vicinity,” he said of the fibre cuts in Egypt that have caused two disruptions to Seacom in a week.

The latest outage is not only affecting Seacom but also other cables such as the Middle East North Africa (MENA) cable system, said Segelberg.

""It's a multitude of cables that are running on this same path,” he said.

""So, you're looking at almost five cable systems obviously coming East-West and it is not good,” he added.

The chief executive officer of Seacom, Byron Clatterbuck, told Fin24 that there is a “bottleneck” in Egypt when it comes to sub-sea broadband cables.

""The bottleneck of a single point of failure in Egypt has always been a concern. You know, even now, more new cables that are being built are being built to cross Egypt because really there's no other way to get East-West,” he said.","The article titled ""Why Seacom has suffered another outage"" discusses the impact of construction work in Egypt on the Seacom undersea broadband cable, which has resulted in fiber cuts disrupting internet services in South Africa.

It directly references incidents of fiber cuts and their implications on internet connectivity, specifically mentioning the Seacom cable and the broader context of multiple cable systems affected by these disruptions.

This aligns well with the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables, as it treats the subject as a central theme rather than a minor mention."

Two years ago the Brisbane based company SubPartners invited the Government to chip in $20 million to tap into the latest arm of its global digital cable network.

The company had intended laying a submarine cable from Perth to Sydney and suggested a spur could be built to connect Tasmania either at Hobart or George Town.

It is part of SubPartner's major plan to build the APX-Central (Perth to Sydney), APX-West (Perth to Singapore) and APX-East (Sydney to US) fibre optic submarine cables.

Technology Minister Michael Ferguson commissioned a consultant to assess the business case for $180,000, but SubPartners never followed through.

""I don't think it's really appropriate to be rushing into these things, when there's not yet a proposal before us,"" Mr Ferguson said.

SubPartners has reportedly experienced delays gaining the necessary permits and securing key customers and investors.

""Until such time as an offer is received from SubPartners, the Government does not have clarity on commercial models or what rights that SubPartners and the Government and/or private investors would have in respect of the operation or resale of data capacity on a Tasmanian branch spur,"" he said.

Bass Strait cable competition hopes dashed
------------------------------------------

The lack of progress has dashed industry hopes that the extra cable would create more competition and bring down internet prices.

Consumer groups had also urged the government to invest in the cable to ensure there would be no repeat of the crippling internet speeds caused when the Basslink undersea cable was cut for repairs last month.

A digital consumers group told a Senate inquiry in Hobart on Thursday that the recent cutting of cable led to ""seven days of internet hell"".

Abe Ydy who makes TV and radio commercials in Launceston saw his work grind to a virtual halt.

""It dramatically slowed down our NBN access, slower than dial-up almost in that we couldn't access any of our cloud-based service,"" he told The World Today.

""We transferred large amounts of audio, large amounts of data files, we couldn't do any transfer, we could access our FTP programs.

""We essentially couldn't operate, it was like cutting the power so to speak.""

He has since switched to Telstra which owns the other fibre-optic cable that connects Tasmania to the mainland.

The plan would see the underwater cable would come within 170 kilometres of Tasmania.

The ASX-listed company this week made a major bid for Nextgen Networks' terrestrial dark fibre and subsea cable projects.

In an interview with _iTnews_, Vocus CEO Geoff Horth revealed how the company plans to revive the fortunes of the Australia-Singapore Cable (ASC) project.

In addition, Horth outlined how the Nextgen buy will open doors for Vocus in Australia's gas-rich north-west, and - for a small additional capital investment - make Vocus a major new player in the NBN points of interconnect (PoI) backhaul space.

**Australian-Singapore cable**

Vocus will now resume selling prospective customers on the Australia-Singapore Cable after several months spent “hamstrung” by negotiations to buy out its joint venture partner on the project.

The buyout, if successful, will give Vocus full control of the 4600km Australia-Singapore Cable (ASC) project that it [revived late last year as a 50-50 joint venture with Nextgen.](http://www.itnews.com.au/news/vocus-nextgen-to-build-171m-submarine-cable-411674)

Horth told _iTnews_ the project remains contingent on securing customer commitments to buy capacity on the cable, which will run from Perth to Singapore.

“We won’t do that project without the appropriate customer backing,” Horth said.

“We’ve been a little bit hamstrung because it was a joint venture with Nextgen, and over the last couple of months it’s been a little bit hard for us to go and talk to prospective customers because we’ve been in negotiations with Nextgen’s owners to buy the business.

“We’ll now press on with that.”

ASC is one of three projects vying to lay a Perth-to-Singapore subsea cable that would compete with the existing SEA-ME-WE3 link on the route.

Competing projects include SubPartners’ APX-West – which recently [switched to a consortium model with Telstra and Optus](http://www.itnews.com.au/news/australia-to-get-long-awaited-perth-to-singapore-subsea-cable-417567) to try to get an edge – and Trident Subsea Cable, which is [trying to secure a final round of finance.](http://www.itnews.com.au/news/trident-to-deploy-pops-in-global-switch-420595)

Horth said ASC is “technically advanced”, having completed marine surveys, secured landing permits and with “most requirements in place” barring enough commitments to see the build progress.

“Obviously there’s a number of competing projects,” he said.

“My view is there’s a good [potential] return but there’s only enough demand for one [to succeed].

“We wouldn’t build unless we can secure some customer commitments.”

Vocus [has said](http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20160629/pdf/4386hcpwdf86l2.pdf) the estimated cost of ASC is around US$130 million (A$174 million).

The company isn’t paying anything upfront to take full ownership of ASC, but is required to pay US$20 million (A$27 million) to Nextgen if construction commences or if it decides to exit the project – for example, to participate in a rival project on the route.

**Tapping the north-west**

Vocus’ buyout of Nextgen also includes the handover of the North West Cable System (NWCS) project – a subsea route between Port Hedland and Darwin designed to service mostly liquefied natural gas (LNG) rigs tapping the north-west shelf.

The base business case for NWCS was to provide the connectivity being demanded by LNG and resources operators to power automated systems at their sites.

NWCS is expected to come online in October. The cable has been laid and – as of February this year – brought to shore at both ends.

The time between now and October will be spent on end-to-end testing of the cable system and making the final connections between customers’ rigs and nearby branching units on the cable.

The foundation customers are Inpex for its Ichthys project and Shell for its Prelude project.

“By the time we take ownership of the asset it’ll be operational for the two cornerstone customers,” Horth said. “It gets handed over to us ready for service.""

Vocus is proposing to make a US$80 million (A$107 million) upfront payment to Nextgen for NWCS, with a further US$20 million (A$27 million) “conditional on certain customer commitments being reached”.

In financial filings, Vocus indicated it would take ownership of the asset for well below what it cost to build. Horth said he was unable to reveal by what margin.

There appears to be a lot of potential upside in NWCS for Vocus.

“It has a significant number of branching units,” Horth said, without being drawn on exactly how many.

“They’ve created branching units for all the likely possible new customer opportunities including other rigs and potentially into other areas [of the north-west].

“It’s definitely future-proofed.”

When NWCS comes online, Darwin will act as the main point for traffic on the subsea cable to interconnect with terrestrial networks.

Though the cable also lands in Port Hedland, Nextgen had only proposed a project to then run a terrestrial fibre link from there down to Geraldton, where it could interconnect with existing fibre into Perth or other capitals.

Horth said Vocus will “explore” a terrestrial link from Port Hedland to Geraldton to complete the north-west fibre loop, but said it would “come down to us getting appropriate customer commitments”.

“We are dealing with some of the resource companies up in the Pilbara to see whether there’s an appetite for that project,” he said.

“If we can get the customer funding we’ll build it and it would complete the loop.”

**Becoming a bigger PoI player**

The Nextgen deal also provides Vocus a way to inexpensively connect to NBN’s network of regional points of interconnect (PoIs).

Vocus’ current on-net coverage is 68 NBN PoIs, courtesy of its metro fibre assets.

“Vocus has a pretty significant metropolitan fibre footprint in all the mainland capital cities, which gets you to most of the metro PoIs,” Horth said.

This contrasts with Nextgen, whose network connects mostly regional centres and therefore passes closeby NBN’s regional PoIs.

Vocus said in financial filings that for an estimated $11.5 million, it would be able to deploy fibre runs from the Nextgen network to these regional PoIs, boosting its on-net PoI connectivity to 112 of a total 121.

“The great surprise in this [deal] is that with a reasonably modest level of capital [we can] run fibre to connect into 112 PoIs,” Horth said.

“It’s a pretty significant strategic outcome for the business.”

Vocus said connecting to the remaining nine PoIs would be economically unviable.

In any event, Vocus has some off-net connectivity to all 121 PoIs using Telstra capacity under a deal brokered by M2 to power its NBN Connect product. Vocus and M2 merged earlier this year.

“We’ll still be utilising that capacity [from Telstra],” Horth said.

“The fibre for the 112 PoIs [that Vocus will connect to directly] will be used to cater for expected growth in capacity and to service our wholesale and our corporate business.

“For a fixed price, [we’ll have] almost unlimited capacity with those 112 PoIs and that’s complementary to the deal we did with Telstra.

“It just gives us our own fibre for the excess capacity beyond the capacity we’re committed to with Telstra.","The article discusses Vocus' involvement with subsea cables, including the Australia-Singapore Cable (ASC) and the North West Cable System (NWCS).

It elaborates on the implications of these cables for internet connectivity and telecommunications, particularly in relation to Vocus' business strategy.

While not exclusively focused on cut sea cables, the topic is treated as significant within the context of Vocus' operations, making it a central theme rather than a minor mention."

Etisalat has warned there may be problems with the internet as repairs continue following the recent Asian earthquake.  

“Etisalat has been informed by the international service providers that repairs to damaged cables are presently underway and will be completed over a three-week period,” the UAE operator said in a statement to _IT Weekly_ this week.  

“During this time, certain bandwidth-intensive, (non-http) applications such as online gaming and peer to peer applications will be moderately affected due to traffic prioritisation steps taken by etisalat,” the operator added.  

Etisalat confirmed that it had experienced temporary drops in internet service quality in the immediate aftermath of the undersea earthquake, which registered 7.1 on the Richter scale and which killed two people.  

The quake, which occurred on December 26, resulted in massive damage to seven of the eight major undersea fiber-optic communication cables near southern Taiwan.  

Etisalat said it coped with the disaster by tapping into its contingency excess capacity and by making use of additional bandwidth allocated to it by other service providers.  

The operator said its team worked round the clock to monitor and ensure traffic prioritisation and allocation of greater resources to critical internet based applications and services.

Johannesburg - Undersea broadband cable provider Seacom has been hit by a fault in the Mediterranean Sea between Egypt and France, possibly impacting connectivity in Africa.  
Seacom operates an undersea broadband cable that connects from South Africa to Europe and Asia along Africa’s eastern coastline.  
And Seacom said in a network update on Monday that it is “experiencing a shunt fault in the mediterranean sea” at 14:00 GMT, which was about 16:00 South African time Monday.  
A shunt fault occurs when the insulation of an undersea cable is damaged and its metallic core makes contact with seawater.  
“The impact of the incident is that all transmission traffic on the East Coast of Africa to and from Europe will be affected,” said the company.  
Seacom further explained that customers with internet protocol (IP) services will remain “unaffected” but could experience “higher latencies”.  
Higher latencies mean that internet traffic takes longer to route around a network.  
Seacom further explained that its traffic would be routed via the West African Cable System (WACS) and the company’s network to its Asia gateways.  
“To repair this shunt fault, a service-affecting planned activity has been scheduled from the 19th October to the 28th October 2016,” said Seacom in its update.  
“A repair vessel has been mobilised and will reach the fault location by the 19th October. Due to the nature of the activity, which largely depends on weather and other sea conditions, the planned work window may vary.”

The _Lodbrog_ is needed because the ship usually brought in for Australian cables, the _Ile de Re_, was already booked to repair the Basslink power-and-comms conduit linking Tasmania to the Australian mainland.

PPC-1 broke at the beginning of this month. The multi-terabit cable runs from Sydney to Guam, with the break located around 4,590 km from the Guam landing.

Its fix is complicated by repairs needed to Basslink.

The mainland-to-Tasmania communications cable runs alongside a power cable also owned by Basslink, and a break in the electrical cable can't be repaired without also breaking the comms link – which is what will occupy the Ile de Re.

TPG's fiber cable fault occurred over the weekend as the Internet service provider's Sydney-Guam submarine cable suffered a major setback.

On Friday, the cable which is operated by Pipe (TPG's subsidiary) went down per the fault notice posted by the operator.

The PPC-1 submarine cable line between Guam and Sydney is the one affected by the fault, which has taken down the 4,287 mile-long cable.

""At approximately 20:00:10 AEDT on Feb. 5, 2016, the TPG Network Operations Centre received multiple alarms for the PPC-1 cable system between Sydney and Guam,"" states the TPG notice. ""The alarms indicated that a submarine line card had lost its payload. A Network Incident ticket was created and the issue was immediately escalated to the PPC-1 transmission engineering team.""

The operator has revealed that the Transmission engineering team — in tandem with infrastructure vendors — has conducted preliminary investigations and found that a fiber fault existed nearly 2,852 miles from Guam.

Australian subscribers of the service will be facing slow Internet due to the unforeseen problem.

In the interim, the Australian-Japan Cable system and the Southern Cross Cable will be deployed to route traffic and used as substitutes said the TPG Telecom.

**When Will The Issue Be Resolved?**

The outage is expected to last a while and will not be fixed before March. Initially, it was anticipated that the outage will take a little over a month to be sorted — the repair date is said to be March 7 — but since repair crews are occupied with another job, it is not known when the fault will be resolved.

The maintenance ship that the TPG Telecom has a contract with to rectify the submarine cable faults is currently engaged in fixing the Basslink cable system, which is between contracted Victoria and Tasmania.

During the outage, TPG is routing traffic via Southern Cross and the Australian-Japan Cable system.

""TPG has started to work with our maintenance contractor to understand when we can mobilize a repair ship to the specific location. Due to the nature of the fault, resolution is expected to take an extended period,"" said the notice.

Meanwhile, Irate TPG customers have expressed their displeasure on the slow browsing speeds.

""Since Friday night, has anyone else been noticing very slow international Internet browsing? Often getting timeouts loading various web sites, or takes a very long time to load up,"" complained a user.

**Key points:**

* Repair ship's crew hopes calm conditions last long enough to complete repairs
* Basslink says cable will still be fixed by mid-June
* Business executives urge more testing to determine the cause of the fault

Last month, cable experts removed the damaged section of the Basslink power cable, but rough conditions prevented the repair ship from returning to the fault site to finish the job.

After three weeks of delay, the ship was finally able to leave Geelong last night, and the repair team hopes calm conditions will last long enough to connect a new section of cable to the existing one.

The repair team needs 16 calm days to work on the cable before it can be up and running again.

Despite the weather delays, Basslink maintains it can still meet the return to service date of mid-June.

What caused the cable to fail in December remains unknown, which is causing concern for major industrials.

**Cause of fault needs to be established: Mostogl**

Bell Bay Aluminium general manager Ray Mostogl said it was impossible to know the likelihood of another outage without knowing what went wrong.

""There's an element of doubt that when the cable gets connected, we'd be back in the situation in six months, 12 months, five years, 10 years,"" he said.

Basslink is awaiting a report from independent experts tests on the faulty section.

The faulty section of the Basslink power cable was removed in March.

The aluminium smelter has reached an agreement with Hydro Tasmania to ramp up to full production after operating at 10 per cent less capacity for five months to save power during the energy crisis.

Mr Mostogl said it was too early to determine how much the energy-saving measures cost the business, but he expected it would be less than the $20 million first predicted.

He called for a thorough analysis of what led to the energy crisis to ensure the business was not placed in a similar position again.

""It's not a matter of trying to apportion blame,"" he said.

""It's really about understanding what were the mechanisms that led to this and what could we have done about it differently.""

He said a long-term energy security plan would be crucial to the business's long-term future in Tasmania.

Tasmania's long-suffering electricity and Internet users – in other words, nearly everyone – will have to wait until mid-June for a fix to the Basslink power and optical fibre cables.

The company has announced ([PDF](http://www.basslink.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Media-Statement-29-March.pdf)) that it's pinpointed the fault on its electricity cables, just 1,150 metres from where it cut the cable for investigation.

That, the company says, is a miss of less than 0.4 per cent of the total cable length.

However, the fault (which is still under investigation) has done so much damage that the electricity cable will need three joints to return to operation.

“The degree of water ingress into the cable through the fault has resulted in more damaged cable that needs to be replaced, which will see a third joint required on the cable”, the statement says.

“In simple terms, water got in and damaged the cable – this now needs to be removed. Consequently, an additional mobilisation phase is required in Geelong to restock the vessel with cable to complete the jointing phase to connect the additional replacement cable”.

That, plus the need for a stretch of clear weather to conduct repair operations, lies behind the company's conservative estimate of a repair date.

The cable ship _Ile de Ré_ is on its way back to Geelong for 10 days' preparation for the jointing work.

Because the Basslink optical fibre cable was laid alongside the electrical cable, it had to be cut for repairs to begin. This has [left subscribers](https://www.theregister.com/2016/03/13/tasmanias_basslink_cut_on_purpose_but_fix_not_until_may/) on TPG's iiNet and Internode complaining about slow connection speeds.

As a result, Taswegian broadband subscribers to Telstra's competitors are throwing fits at what they're describing as an Internet brownout, with even NBN subscribers complaining that they're barely able to achieve 1 Mbps download speeds.

With the cable now cut – and likely out of commission until May – Telstra is now the only game in town, and while backhaul prices from Tasmania are capped by a service declaration from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, it seems TPG is unwilling to buy as much from Telstra as it had been buying from Basslink.

Digital Tasmania [said](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3212494/2016-03-12%20-%20INTERNET%20BROWNOUTS%20CONTINUE%20IN%20TASMANIA.pdf) after the first 24 hours without Basslink, capacity was strained no matter what access network the consumer was trying to use.

Tasmania's minister for technology and innovation Michael Ferguson has urged Telstra's competitors to [buy more backhaul](http://www.premier.tas.gov.au/releases/internet_service_interruptions) from Telstra.

Ferguson notes that wholesale prices are capped by ACCC service declarations.

Internode has posted [this explanation](http://advisories.internode.on.net/item/14841) to its customers. The company says Telstra Wholesale has committed to configuring extra bandwidth for iiNet/Internode customers by Thursday March 17, after which it will contact customers regarding rebates.

What caused the Basslink electrical and data cable failure isn't yet known but it's becoming a political storm in the state.

When the cable was built, the state government expected most of the time it would be helping Hydro Tasmania export the state's green power to the mainland.

Now, [according to _The Mercury_](http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/hydro-tasmania-exceeded-safe-power-transmission-levels-basslink-says/news-story/604185bf8d24057f82bbf56f94a0db93#load-story-comments), Basslink is accusing Hydro Tasmania of exceeding the cable's safe operating parameters, because the lucrative trade selling green power to the mainland was irresistible.

The cable's owner (a company called Cityspring) has already been in dispute with Hydro Tasmania, accusing it of loading the cable so hard in 2012 (more than 80 GWh per week was sent to Victoria, the _Mercury_ reports) that it caused repeated outages. ®","The article discusses the Basslink electrical and data cable that was cut, which is a submarine cable connecting Tasmania to the mainland.

A repair ship was due to leave Geelong this morning, headed to the fault site about 100 kilometres off Tasmania's coast, but strong winds and high seas have forced Basslink to cancel the trip.

The ship is now planning to leave next week.

A Basslink spokesman said the delay had eaten into its contingencies but it was still anticipating fixing the cable by mid-June.

Energy Minister Matthew Groom told Parliament the company had factored in weather delays into its repair timeline.

""It is subject to suitable weather conditions,"" he said.

""While there are heavy winds forecast for Bass Strait over the next few days, Basslink continues to advise that the return-to-service date of the interconnector remains at mid-June.""

Basslink has already pushed back three repair deadlines due to difficulties pinpointing the exact location of the fault and complications.

Tasmania was importing about 40 per cent of its electricity demands before the cable went down in December, forcing the state to rely on power generated within the state.

Record low rainfall since spring has added to the pressure on Hydro Tasmania's dams, which are now at 13 per cent, and forced the state to use diesel generators.

While the bad weather has delayed Basslink repairs, heavy rain has brought some relief to Hydro's dams which have risen for the first time since September.

- Fault appears to be 98 kilometres offshore  
- Cable will be lifted and repaired next week  
- Repairs will take another two weeks  

The cable was bringing about 40 per cent of Tasmania's power to the state, but an unidentified fault put it out of action in December.

In a statement to the market, Basslink said there had been 20 dives by remote-controlled vehicles which had collected more than 500 hours of data and images of the cable.

Chief executive Malcolm Eccles said the fault appeared to be about 98 kilometres off the coast of Tasmania.

The cable will be lifted to the surface in the next week, weather permitting. It will then be cut, tested and capped to prevent moisture getting in, a process which is expected to take another fortnight.

Mr Eccles said it was a complex operation which required ""great care and consideration"". ""The consequences of a hasty and ill-considered decision will be far-reaching,"" Mr Eccles said.  

""We have reached this milestone only after detailed analysis of the test results and close consultation with leading experts from around the world.""

**New cables to be inserted**  
After the cut, the repair ship Il de Re will return to Geelong to prepare for inserting new cables of the required lengths. The ""cut and cap"" process will take at least two weeks. Basslink said that on best estimates, it expected the cable to be operational again in late May. The exact cause of the fault is not expected to be known for some time. A Hydro Tasmania observer remains on the repair ship.  

""While there remains some more days of work and analysis to be done before we can provide a more accurate estimate of return to service, it is an important milestone,"" Mr Eccles said.

Internet service providers (ISPs) have told Tasmanian customers they will secure extra bandwidth from Telstra by Thursday, after complaints of slow and disrupted internet.

Providers have had to purchase capacity on Telstra's private fibre-optic cable, after the Basslink undersea cable was cut on Friday for repair work.

The undersea link is used to import and export some power as well as fibre-optic internet between Tasmania and Victoria, and has been out of action since December.

iiNet and Internode, both owned by TPG, service about 40 per cent of the state's market but did not secure enough bandwidth for demand.

Basslink said Telstra offered them a ""completely uncommercial"" deal to move all their service providers, so individual companies were left to negotiate their own deals.

It is expected that Basslink will not be fixed until late May, and in the meantime ISPs have to use Telstra's fibre-optic cables.

The state's IT Minister, Michael Ferguson, said TPG has promised an improved service.

""They will be reviewing the situation with a view to purchasing additional capacity from Telstra,"" he said.

**Internet users urged to seek compensation**

Consumer group Choice has encouraged Tasmanian customers experiencing poor internet to seek compensation.

Choice spokesman Tom Godfrey said there was no excuse for the poor service.

""Although we can understand that it is out of their control, they are selling internet services and internet access,"" he said.

""It's a pretty simple thing, and they have to make sure you're able to access the internet and under Australian consumer law, if you're selling that service and you can't deliver it, then the consumer has a right to a remedy.""

*   Repairs costing at least $100,000 per day
*   Basslink reconsidering telecommunications role

A fault in the cable has plunged Tasmania into an energy crisis compounded by record low rainfall which left the state's hydro dams critically low.

The Basslink cable was bringing about 40 per cent of Tasmania's power to the state but a fault put it out of action in December.

About 9:15pm on Friday, Basslink severed the cable as it began repairs. It is not expected to be fully fixed until May.

Mr Eccles told 936 ABC Hobart the fault was somewhere between the cut 89 kilometres off the Tasmanian coast and Victoria.

""We don't know until we actually start to do the next phase of testing,"" he said.

""We need the weather window to be able to lift the cable to put it on the deck of the vessel and then we have to carry out a number of tests.

""And only then after we've done those tests will we know if we're 200 metres, 500 metres, a kilometre [from where the cable was cut].""

Mr Eccles said he was confident there would not be a long stretch of cable that needed to be replaced.

He said the vessel being used in the repair job was very expensive.

""If you've got a submarine cable which is 300 kilometres and you need to fix it it's $100,000 a day for a vessel, minimum,"" he said.

""The repair costs are phenomenal.""

The Tasmanian Government is moving to set up a parliamentary inquiry to examine [the circumstances leading to the state's energy crisis.](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-09/tasmanian-government-wants-federal-funding-of-second-basslink/7231714)

Energy Minister Matthew Groom said a joint house parliamentary inquiry would also get its chance to review the crisis.

Basslink reconsidering telecommunications role
----------------------------------------------

Basslink also carries fibre optic cable as well as its power infrastructure.

It is used by a number of non-Telstra affiliated internet service providers (ISPs), but that service stopped when the cable was cut.

That left about one third of Tasmania's internet users with very slow or ""unusable"" internet speeds.

Telstra operates its own undersea cables which it said had ""more than enough"" capacity to provide affected ISPs the bandwidth they need.

But Basslink said the terms offered by Telstra were ""completely uncommercial"" leaving the ISPs to negotiate the service separately.

[The degraded service prompted an angry response from customers](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-12/basslink-repairs-hit-internet-users-in-tasmania/7241896) who felt they were not warned about the outage.

Mr Eccles said his company's primary business was power and it may reconsider its telecommunications role in the future.

""We've always said it's got to be a viable business for us, the moment it becomes unviable...then it would be unfair to our shareholders to actually continue.""

That could also mean a price increase for customers.

""We are requesting a fair price for the use of our asset,"" Mr Eccles said.

The APX-West project has been in motion for the past three years.

In 2013, Telstra signed its first non-binding memorandum of understanding to buy one of four planned fibre pairs on the cable system.

But SubPartners' previous plan to own and operate the cable system while allowing others to buy capacity saw it struggle to obtain seed funding to get the build started.

Over the past few years it has reworked its approach to a consortium model where each player provides funding for their portion of cable build and is responsible for the operation and maintenance of their section of the system once live.

This approach proved more successful and has now seen Telstra, Optus parent SingTel and several other unnamed parties sign up and invest in the cable's build. SubPartners will also own, operate and fund an undisclosed portion of APX-West.

It declined to provide the financial details of the arrangement.

But SubPartners CEO Bevan Slattery told iTnews funding levels would be proportionate to each player's respective capacity.

The cable build overall is expected to cost in excess of US$100 million.

""All the major players [will have] access to ownership economics at a fraction of the cost of private cable ownership,"" Slattery said in a statement.

""This is a unique commercial model for the Perth-Singapore route that will satisfy the ongoing bandwidth requirements of both network operators and internet content hosts.”

Slattery also said the growth of Singapore as a cloud and interconnection hub for the APAC region, combined with recent submarine cable outages and the lack of extra capacity on the existing SEA-ME-WE 3 cable had ""crystalised the benefits"" of APX-West.

""Ultimately the commercial construct, the reworked design and timing was right,"" he said.

With funding for the build secured, construction is scheduled to commence before July this year and be complete by 2018.

The cable system has been downgraded from four fibre pairs to two, with minimum capacity now planned at 20Tbps compared to an initial 32Tbps.

Slattery said the company was using new technology which allowed each individual party to ""light"" their own spectrum- ""almost like 'virtual fibre pairs'"", he said.

**No more NextDC**

APX-West will span 4500km from Perth to Singapore and carry two-way data transmission traffic. It will be built by United States cable layer TE Subcom.

SubPartners had previously said the APX-West cable system - alongside its APX-Central subsea cable connecting Perth to Sydney - would land in NextDC's P1 data centre in Perth.

He declined to provide further detail due to the ""confidential"" nature of the new landing location, but indicated the cable would terminate in facilities operated by Telstra, SingTel and SubPartners in both Singapore and Australia.

As a result, for the last 4 days, people including the internet service providers of the country are experiencing slow internet. Meanwhile, Bangladesh Submarine Cables PLC (BSCPLC) said that the repair work of the submarine cable can be completed by the last week of May. BSCPLC General Manager (Operation and Maintenance) Saidur Rahman revealed the news on Tuesday.

He said that the SEA- ME- WE-5 cable was cut in the sea area of Indonesia at midnight last Friday. Their administrative work there takes a little more time. All in all, they said, the work can be done by the third or fourth week of next month.

Saidur Rahman stated that not all available options have been fully implemented yet. The country's inaugural submarine cable, SEA-ME-WE-4, possesses the capability to handle the full bandwidth. However, the associated company would need to incur additional costs for its activation, a step that has not yet been taken.

Nonetheless, progress is underway with other available options.

It has been revealed that the country currently enjoys 1600 Gbps bandwidth through the SEA-ME-WE-5 cable. Unfortunately, the second submarine cable encountered a disruption approximately 440 km west of Singapore on Friday, leading to its complete shutdown. This issue has not only impacted Bangladesh but has also affected several other nations. Consequently, efforts are underway to establish an alternative system utilizing the SEA-ME-WE-4 cable. Notably, Bangladesh's initial submarine cable, SEA-ME-WE-4, has a landing station in Cox's Bazar, while the second submarine cable, SEA-ME-WE-5, enters through Kuakata.

In response to the decommissioning of SEA-ME-WE-5, a considerable portion of the bandwidth is being transferred to the SEA-ME-WE-4 cable to ensure continued connectivity.","The article discusses the SEA-ME-WE-5 submarine cable that has been cut, leading to slow internet services in Bangladesh.

If you are in the United States or any location overseas and trying to call loved ones in Palau, do not be alarmed if your call is not received or responded to, the internet in Palau is inaccessible during this time.

Palau connects to the rest of the world via submarine cable. “Since Belau Submarine Cable Corporation (BSCC)’s Palau Cable Network No 1 connects to SEA–US for onward transport to Guam, BSCC will be unable to provide service for the duration of the repair. BSCC will be unable to provide any international connectivity for Palau,” announced the joint press release from BSCC and PNCC yesterday.

The SEA–US cable network is under emergency repair as several cables at the SEA-US cable landing at PITI, Guam, were extensively damaged. The cause of the damage is not yet confirmed, but it is suspected that it may have been caused by Supertyphoon Mawar, which hit Guam in May of this year.

The joint press release from Belau Submarine Cable Corporation (BSCC) and Palau National Communications Corporation (PNCC) states, “For safety reasons, repairs can only be undertaken when the cable is not powered,” explaining the reason for the outage.

Meanwhile, Palau National Communications Corporation (PNCC), through satellite connection, will provide only limited capacity compared to normal cable service.

“Only limited internet services will be provided through PNCC’s satellite backup services for essential government services such as police, fire and rescue, hospital, Judiciary and limited access for local banks to enable internet access for their ATM as well as card swipe machines at some locations,” announced the joint press release.

These Iranian-backed militants have previously disrupted global supply chains by attacking commercial vessels in this strategic waterway.

Israeli news outlet Globes reported last week that the Houthis were allegedly responsible for the cable damage. However, Yemeni rebel leader Abdel Malek al-Houthi denied these accusations. He said: “We have no intention of targeting sea cables providing internet to countries in the region.”

ABU DHABI // Faster, and possibly cheaper, internet could be in store for residents following the expected completion of a number of regional submarine telecommunication cable projects this year.

“From the end-users perspective, which is through your mobile, you will have a faster speed,” said Omar Jassim bin Kalban, managing director and chief executive of E-marine, a Dubai-based submarine cable and installation company.

“It would also give a chance to the operators to consider a revision of the price, however, it’s up to them.”

The extra bandwidth could provide UAE internet providers lower per unit data costs, which they could then transfer on to consumers.

The infrastructure upgrade currently in the works could also help handle a predicted rise in data usage coming from consumers using data heavy applications such as movie streaming and, further down the road, as 5G mobile networks are developed and deployed.

Residents have previously complained about internet pricing and not being able to reach the highest available speeds. Twitter users also voiced concern over the video quality of streaming services.

The cables will increase the amount of data flowing in and out of the UAE and create “better connectivity between the regional countries and to the outside world”, said Mr bin Kalban.

E-marine – a wholly owned subsidiary of Etisalat – is involved in many of the projects, including a 20,000-kilometre cable system under construction that stretches from Singapore to France called “Sea-Me-We 5” that includes a UAE connection.

“In the UAE this year, I expect they will land four international submarine cables, stretching all the way from Europe and the Far East,” he said. “Etisalat and du, are putting in huge investments to land more and more cables.”

In the next 10 years, bandwidth capacity will be four times the current capacity, he said.

Nearly all the internet data that travels across the world's oceans is transmitted through submarine cables rather than satellite communication systems.

Cables are specially constructed to withstand the harsh environment on the sea floor, including the pressure of having kilometres of water above them.

But they are also susceptible to natural disasters – several were affected by the 2011 earthquake in Japan. They can also be the focus of sabotage. In 2003, Egypt’s navy captured three scuba divers trying to cut an undersea internet cable in the Mediterranean.

In January, du notified customers about multiple submarine cuts to a cable in the Red Sea off the coast of Egypt, of which E-marine played a role in fixing. The cause was never revealed.

Mr bin Kalban said the UAE’s infrastructure is set up to mitigate any potential disruption.

“In case of damage, you will never have 100 per cent failure as there is a diversity in routing which will guarantee that most of the traffic is maintained at the same quality of service.”

E-marine is the host of this week’s SubOptic 2016 conference – an event for the submarine cable industry.

**UAE is the perfect location for internet hub**

While it is often called cyberspace, the internet is, for the most part, a physically connected system.

While some remote areas of the globe require satellites for internet, much of the world gets their service from cables installed deep on the seabed floor that contain the optical fibres which transmit the data.

The strategic geographic position that played a role in the UAE’s economic development long before the internet became part of everyday life will see it become a regional data hub.

The country is also home to E-Marine – a company that claims to have become “one of the market leaders in submarine cable installation, maintenance and repair services”.

With a fleet of four specially equipped ships and 12-tonne robots that can operate in waters as deep 2,500 metres, the company handles the bulk of installation and cable maintenance in the region.

The ships and robots, with complex propulsion systems, can even work in rough sea conditions.

A number of projects are underway to increase connectivity in the UAE, which could potentially provide benefits for residents and the business community.

“They look at submarine cables as an integral part of a country’s infrastructure,” said Omar bin Kalban, E-marine’s managing director and chief executive.

“They are important to attract foreign investment, tourism, and education.”

He said that the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) was also studying plans to further increase bandwidth.

**Key points:**
- ISPs use fibre-optic within Basslink cable for services in Tasmania
- Basslink cut the cable Friday night to begin repairs
- Internet users furious at slow service

Tasmanians have reported slow internet speeds after repairs began on the faulty Basslink cable.

The undersea link is used to import and export some power as well as fibre-optic internet between Tasmania and Victoria, and has been out of action since December.

About 9:15pm on Friday, Basslink severed the cable as it began repairs. It is not expected to be fully fixed until May.

Telstra has two of its own undersea cables.

The ABC understands Telstra offered Basslink a deal a month ago to provide capacity to its internet service providers (ISPs), including iiNet.

But Basslink said the terms being offered by Telstra at that time were ""completely uncommercial"".

The ISPs now have to negotiate separately with Telstra.

iiNet is one of the internet providers experiencing disruptions to service speeds.

In a statement on Facebook the company said it was unclear how long the disruption would last.

""During this repair process iiNet customers will experience a degraded service with capacity on the links that transfer telecommunication services to the region reduced,"" it said.

""We have implemented an alternate solution for the duration of these repairs, however it is important to note this will provide limited capacity for iiNet customers.""

iiNet said affected customers would be contacted for applicable downtime credits to their normal billing.

Internode customers are also affected.

**Web browsing possible, but very sluggish**

iiNet and Internode provide up to 40 per cent of the market in Tasmania.

Consumer advocacy group Digital Tasmania said speeds seemed to have improved since peak times on Friday night.

""To look at video and other content out of Tasmania is was getting very slow with a lot of buffering and the circle going along there,"" Andrew Connor from Digital Tasmania said.

""Web browsing is still possible but very sluggish compared to normal, especially on the NBN.

""It's like a pipe, you're trying to push a certain amount of water or pressure through it and if that pipe's only big enough, the flow is going to slow down for everyone that's using it.""

iiNet provides internet services for most of the Tasmanian public sector.

Minister for Technology and Innovation Michael Ferguson said the Government had ensured enough capacity had been arranged for government, education and research customers.

""[The] Government is advised that there is still ample capacity,"" he said.

**'I tried to download a file, it took 12 hours'**

Tony Harrison runs a communications company between Hobart and Melbourne.

""It was difficult I was trying to download a file about 280 megabyte file, it took 12 hours to download, now that's a bit of a problem it would normally take about 15 minutes,"" he said.

""We received a notice yesterday, which was a bit late I guess, we anticipated there might be a hiccup but then I do recall Minister Ferguson saying there'd be no problem earlier in the year, that there'd be plenty of capacity.

""Well, yesterday shows that if there is plenty of capacity we don't have access to it.

""It's just a matter of the internet providers reaching an agreement with Telstra and that's what really needs to be done as a matter of urgency and I'd urge the powers that be to step in and make sure that happens as quickly as possible.""

Basslink's repair teams will continue testing parts of the cut cable to isolate the fault - a process which could take up to two weeks.

Basslink has also warned the process will likely be disrupted by weather conditions, with swells and waves posing a hazard to crews.

CEO Malcolm Eccles said the first cut to the cable was a major step forward.

""After working round the clock since the outage, we are pleased to reach this important milestone,"" he said.

The fault in the cable was located 89 kilometres from Tasmania's north coast and divers assessed the fault on Friday.

**The internet disruption due to a cut in the country's second submarine cable at Kuakata is likely to continue for at least 4-5 days, according to Bangladesh submarine cable authorities.**

The submarine cable SEA-ME-WE 5, which is the source of 1700 GBPS bandwidth, is not allowing any data traffic after it was cut 440km west of Singapore at 12am on Friday.

""The international consortium is looking for a special purpose ship that is a must for the restoration of the undersea cable,"" Mirza Kamal Ahmed, managing director (additional charge) of the Bangladesh Submarine Cables PLC, told The Business Standard.

""No one can specify the exact duration,"" he said, adding, ""Based on past cases, it is likely to require a minimum of 4-5 days.""

However, internet service has been kept running with the help of the country's first submarine cable SEA-ME-WE-4 at Cox's Bazar and ITC companies, even though the speed remains low, the state-run submarine cable operator said.

Significant amount of unused bandwidth from the cut SEA-ME-WE 5 cable is being shifted to the first cable, it added.

""We are serving all our users with the help of other sources of bandwidth—the international terrestrial cable (ITC) and the first submarine cable,"" said Nazmul Karim Bhuiyan, secretary general of the ISP Association of Bangladesh.

However, users are facing some lag, he told TBS on Saturday afternoon.

""As the main broadband usage peaks during the night, we could learn about the full extent of the disruption and any resulting delays tonight,"" he added.

In a statement today (20 April), the submarine cable authorities expressed sincere apologies for the temporary inconvenience to its customers and assured of quick restoration of the second cable.

Bangladesh currently needs some 5,200 GBPS internet bandwidth and half of the demand is being catered by the ITC companies which import bandwidth from India.

For the remaining half of the demand, the country depends on the state-owned Bangladesh Submarine Cable Company.

The first submarine cable SEA-ME-WE 4, in Cox's Bazar, supplies around 850 GBPS bandwidth.","The article titled 'Internet disruption likely to continue for 4-5 more days' discusses a significant incident involving the cut submarine cable SEA-ME-WE 5.

After extensive fault-finding work, Basslink said the probable fault location was approximately 98 kilometres from the Tasmanian coast.

The Île de Ré cable repair ship will now cut the combined power and data cables, recover the ends to the ship, and test and cap them to prevent water from entering.

Basslink said the cut and cap process, subject to weather conditions in the Bass Strait, should take around two weeks. Cutting the cable will also sever the optical fibre link running along the interconnector, making Tasmania reliant on just two, older connections operated by incumbent Telstra.

Once the cut and cap operation is done, the Île de Ré will return to Geelong and load cable jointing equipment and personnel before the ship heads back to the cut location to insert new lengths at the point.

Locating the fault has turned out to be a lengthy and difficult task for Basslink's contractors Alcatel-Lucent.

So far, it's taken more than a month of round the clock work to find the fault, with experts conducting over 20 remotely operated vehicle missions that have collected in excess of 500 hours of pictures and other data.

As of yet, there is no indication as to what caused the fault. There is no visible damage to the cable, Basslink said, saying further cutting may be needed.

**Author:** Juha Saarinen  

Cable operator Basslink is still searching for a fault on its cable connecting Tasmania with mainland Australia that was first identified last month, but expects it to be repaired on schedule by mid-March.

A fault affecting the high voltage direct current electricity interconnector on the 295 kilometre cable occurred on December 20 last year. It is estimated to be approximately 100 kilometres off Tasmania in the Bass Strait.

Basslink chief executive Malcolm Eccles said the first inspection of the cable using a remotely operated submarine did not reveal where the fault was.

The Alcatel-Lucent-operated cable vessel Ile de Ré has now been dispatched from Auckland with a 80-tonne cable reel frame fitted to its deck to locate the fault. The ship is currently in the Bass Strait, with 60 people onboard including 13 cable joiners from Italy to find the fault, which is expected to take another four to five days.

One of two remotely controlled submarines will be used to cut the cable so it can be lifted up for repairs - the cable itself weighs 60 kilogram per metre and ""lifting this weight at sea poses a range of challenges,"" Basslink said.

Cutting the cable will take the fibre optic telecommunications cable out of service until the entire circuit has been repaired, Eccles said.

Basslink expects the cable to be cut and the fault analysed in early February. Repairs are still expected to be completed, putting Basslink back in service, by March 19, Eccles said.

He said telcos and internet providers on Basslink ""have contingencies in place, or are in the process of finalising these contingencies,"" but did not specify what these were.

Telstra operates two cables between Tasmania and the mainland, Bass Strait 1 and 2, which became operational in 1995 and 2003.

Subpartners is in the midst of laying the APX-Central cable, which spans 4800 kilometres from Perth to Sydney with spurs to Adelaide, Melbourne and Hobart. The cable is expected to be ready for service in the third quarter of this year.

Shadow treasurer Scott Bacon told the ABC the fibre-optic cable outage would affect somewhere in the region of 50 percent of Tasmanian telco customers for the next six weeks.

In early 2011, the 640-gigabyte ALBA-1 cable landed at the eastern Cuban town of Siboney from the Venezuelan port of La Guaira.

“In the two years since,” Doug Madory wrote on the Rensys blog, “the fate of the cable has been a mystery for Cuba observers. In the past week, our global monitoring system has picked up indications that this cable has finally been activated, although in a rather curious way, as we explain below.”

Cuba, now run ostensibly by Fidel Castro’s brother, Raúl, has long been an ally of oil-rich Venezuela, run by ailing populist Hugo Chávez, who has had a number of operations in Cuba for his cancer.

The submarine cable was supposed to end Cuba’s reliance on three foreign satellite services for its connection to the Internet, which is restricted largely to government offices and hard currency hotels for foreigners.

Rensys noticed last Monday that Spanish telecom giant Telefonica began service to Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba S.A. (ETECSA), the state telecom of Cuba. There is evidence, however, that the satellite services are still being used in conjunction with the submarine cable, indicating that the delays and problems with firing up the Cuban Internet have not been thoroughly eliminated.

Cuba under Raúl Castro has seen some loosening of controls against Cuban citizens, including legalizing the personal sale of homes and cars and a promise of free movement that sent Cubans running for long passport lines last week.

“We believe it is likely that Telefonica’s service to ETECSA is, either by design or misconfiguration, using its new cable asymmetrically (i.e., for traffic in only one direction),” said Madory. “In such a configuration, ETECSA enjoys greater bandwidth and lower latencies (along the submarine cable) when receiving Internet traffic but continues to use satellite services for sending traffic.”

Cuba continues to have one of the most restrictive Internet regimes in the world, rivaling North Korea. The lack of access is a detriment to, among other things, students studying engineering and related topics. A country famous for its medical competency could surely flourish in other areas should a path to open inquiry finally be established.

“Like a voracious Saturn devouring his children, the principal leaders of the revolution have not allowed any favored sons to overshadow them,” prominent Cuban blogger Yoanni Sanchez wrote recently in Foreign Policy.

Until his son feeds him a stone, things are likely to remain much the same.

**Update:** Monday, Rensys announced that Cuba seems to have switched over fully to cable for its outgoing Internet traffic, producing a profile consistent with “the traditional Internet that nearly everyone else on earth enjoys.” Reports from Havana indicated that “delays for Internet traffic were dropping perceptibly, as the new routing policy kicked in… We speculate that Cuban network operators changed their routing policy to make the ALBA-1 cable the default path for all outbound traffic from certain Cuban networks.”","The article discusses the activation of the ALBA-1 submarine cable in Cuba and its implications for internet connectivity.

ISLAMABAD/KARACHI: A fault in the India-Middle East-Western Europe (IMEWE) submarine cable caused consumers and businesses across Pakistan major internet disruptions, the Pakistan Tele­communication Authority (PTA) said on Saturday, adding that customers may experience slow browsing speed.

However, many people complained that they had no internet service at all.

“The Pakistan Telecom­munication Company Limi­ted (PTCL) has set up alternate routes to get the internet back up. The international team is dealing with the IMEWE and it will take a few days to sort out,” said PTCL spokesperson Imran Janjua.

“At the moment, there are two submarine cables which are down — there was a similar issue in July this year and it is still being repaired,” he added.

> PTA says traffic being rerouted through alternative routes; tech industry at a virtual standstill

The PTA and PTCL did not confirm how long it would take to restore internet services in the country.

The IMEWE submarine cable is an ultra-high capacity fibre optic undersea cable system which links India and Europe via the Middle East. The 12,091km-long cable has nine terminal stations, operated by leading telecom carriers from eight countries.

“One of the PTCL cables has been cut near Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Currently, internet services are affected. However, PTCL is in process [of shifting] its traffic on alternate routes/cables and services will be better soon,” said PTA spokesperson Khurram Mehran.

Khalid Bajwa of Patari, the country’s largest Pakis­tani music streaming platform, said that they had content scheduled to go up on social media on Saturday.

“Everything has stopped. There were a couple of videos which had to go to a brand for approval but nothing has happened. We upload around three to four videos everyday and have been trying to do so since morning but no luck,” he told Dawn.

WonderTree, a start-up run by Mohammad Waqas, also faced similar issues.

“We are a technology start-up and we have not been able to do anything from morning to evening,” he said.

“We had a lot of deadlines for Saturday, as it is the weekend and we needed to wind up a lot of things. Online banking was not available either, so we could not make payments. We just weren’t able to function,” he added.

Akash Sheikh of Nest IO — a technology incubator — said: “It is of great concern that our internet connectivity nationwide has been affected. A strong internet link is essential for productivity and critical to our infrastructure.”

Naseer Akhtar, chairman of the Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA), explained that such accidents happened all over the world, but stressed the necessity to invest in alternative routes for internet traffic, so businesses and people don’t suffer. “We’re lucky it happened over the weekend and not during a busy week,” he said.

According to Mustafa Butt, an information technology entrepreneur, activities came to a halt at work throughout the day. “Luckily it is a holiday and there is not much of a work load,” he added.

Mohammad Faisal, another IT entrepreneur, said that his entire day had been wasted. “Whatever little progress could be made was through mobile data. Most companies in the IT sector cannot afford the slightest disruption in internet service,” said the entrepreneur.

The outage also impacted mobile networks and internet service providers. Although Nayatel messaged its subscribers that its links would up by evening, browsing remained slow. PTCL subscribers struggled with browsing till late Saturday evening.

Wi-Tribe sent a message out to its customers explaining that “you might experience slow speed issue today due to a severe bandwidth degradation affecting all the internet service providers in Pakistan.”

Internet services were also disrupted in July, when a similar fault with one of the PTCL submarine cables created an outage. It took several hours before the internet traffic — both incoming and outgoing — were routed through an alternative cable.","The article titled 'Undersea cable fault strangles internet services' discusses a significant fault in the IMEWE submarine cable, which has led to major internet disruptions in Pakistan.

**Published Date:** 03/29/2016  
**Author:** Ayodele Oluwagbemi  

NatCom Development and Investment Limited, trading as ntel, Nigeria’s broadband LTE network, has announced the successful repair and return to service of its SAT-3 submarine cable.

SAT-3/WASC/SAFE or South Atlantic 3/West Africa Submarine Cable is the longest submarine communications cable in the world with 17 landing points linking Portugal and Europe to South Africa, with connections to several West African countries along the route. It forms part of the SAT-3/WASC/SAFE cable system, where the SAFE cable links South Africa to Asia.

The SAT-3/WASC/SAFE system provides a path between Europe and Asia for telecommunications traffic that is an alternative to the cable routes that pass through the Middle East.

The Chief Executive Officer of ntel, Kamar Abass, said SAT-3 provided access to global markets and enabled “seamless and diverse” connectivity to the rest of the world.

He said, “The repair of SAT-3 is fantastic news for data-hungry consumers and corporate in need of superfast and abundant broadband carried over a robust fibre network with significant capacity and low latency.

“SAT-3’s 17 landing points and intermediate branches in-country and abroad provide for connections all the way to the FarEast, thanks to our alliance with SAFE.”

According to Abass, potential customers of SAT-3 include Nigeria’s Global System for Mobile communication and LTE operators, Internet Service Providers, major international companies, Private Telecom Operators, Content/Hosting Operators, Infomedics/Infomatics Operators, the judiciary (for the execution of real-time on-line matters), banks and the military as well as airline operators.

“SAT-3’s repair also included the cable’s physical diversion away from shipping lanes in the approach to the Port of Lagos. In the past, the dropping (and dragging) of anchors by such traffic had been associated with disruptions to the cable.

“With the repaired system’s activation, the system’s Upgrade IV will also be implemented. This boosts its throughput capacity from 420Gbps to 920Gbps in the northern segments and from 340Gbps to 800Gbps in the southern segments,” the ntel CEO said.

“SAT-3 Nigeria is now positioned to better address Nigeria’s need for super-fast internet connectivity, data-hungry applications, high-quality video-on-demand and increasing social media usage, thus enhancing customer experience.

“Today, submarine cable systems carry more than 98 per cent of all overseas voice, data and video traffic,” he said.

“The return of SAT-3 is significant in many respects. First launched in 2001, it was the precursor for Internet access between Europe and West Africa and it took off where SAT-2 left off as it reached full capacity.

“SAT-2 was brought into service in the early 1990s as a replacement for the original undersea cable SAT-1 that was constructed in the 1960s.”","The article discusses the SAT-3 submarine cable, focusing on its repair and significance for telecommunications.

It directly mentions 'submarine cable' and elaborates on the implications of its repair for internet connectivity.

Google has announced the launch of the first ever submarine cable route between Africa and Australia, named Umoja (the Swahili word for unity). The cable will be anchored in Kenya, and pass through Uganda, Rwanda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and South Africa before crossing the Indian Ocean to reach Australia. Johannesburg, South Africa, is the location of Google’s first African data centre, which has been operational since January. 

The land-based part of the cable is already completed, with the South Africa to Perth connection still to be deployed. “The new intercontinental fiber optic route will significantly enhance our global and regional digital infrastructure,” said William Ruto, President of Kenya in a press release. “This initiative is crucial in ensuring the redundancy and resilience of our region’s connectivity to the rest of the world, especially in light of recent disruptions caused by cuts to sub-sea cables. By strengthening our digital backbone, we are not only improving reliability but also paving the way for increased digital inclusion, innovation, and economic opportunities for our people and businesses.” 

In March, four submarine cables situated on the West Coast of Africa – WACS, Sat-3, Ace, and MainOne – were severed near the Ivory Coast, causing major internet issues across the continent. “Diversifying Australia’s connectivity and supporting digital inclusion across the globe are both incredibly important objectives, and Google’s Umoja cable will help to do just that,” said Australia’s Minister for Communications Michelle Rowland MP. 

As well as the cable deployment, Google also signed a Statement of Collaboration with Kenya’s Ministry of Information Communications to partner on issues such as cybersecurity, digital upskilling and AI safety. Back in 2021, Google pledged to spend $1 billion across Africa in five years in areas such as startup investment and digital transformation. It has so far spent $900 million, and is set to reach its target in 2026. Since the pledge, however, Google claims that its products and services have added more than $30 billion of economic activity across Sub-Saharan Africa.","The article discusses the launch of a new submarine cable connecting Africa and Australia, mentioning the implications of recent disruptions caused by cuts to submarine cables.

Internet service across swaths of Asia, Europe, and the Middle East has been disrupted following damages to undersea cables of major providers to the areas.

A statement from Hong Kong telecom HGC Global Communications says as much as 25% of the traffic in the areas has been impacted. The company is currently rerouting traffic to keep disruptions to a minimum and “extending assistance to affected businesses.”

There are more than 15 undersea internet cables in the Red Sea. To have four damaged at a single time is “exceptionally rare,” HGC said in a separate earlier statement.

The disruption of the cables did not disconnect any country from the internet, but the Wall Street Journal reports service in India, Pakistan, and parts of East Africa was noticeably degraded.

No services have yet offered a reason for the cuts. Yemen’s telecom ministry denied speculation it was responsible for the failures, saying it was “keen to keep all telecom submarine cables…away from any possible risks.”

Underwater cables are responsible for most of the internet’s data traffic. They’re cheaper than land-based cables, but are prone to damage from ships’ anchors.

The ongoing conflict in the Middle East has experts wondering about the timing and severity of this outage, though. Iran-based Houthi has been particularly aggressive in the Red Sea, including in mid-February when a cargo ship was abandoned by its crew following an Houthi attack. The ship, which had weighed anchor, drifted for weeks before sinking.

Houthi control of the region and the ongoing strife in Yemen makes repairing the damaged cables more complicated. One of the four companies affected said it expects to start that process early in the second quarter, though permit issues, weather, and the civil war in that country could impact that.","The article titled ""Four internet cables cut in Red Sea in 'exceptionally rare' incident"" discusses the cutting of four major internet cables in the Red Sea, which has disrupted internet service across Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.

According to the ITU's ""Facts and Figures 2023"" report, 37% of the African population had internet access in 2023. Although this represents a slight decrease from the previous year's 40%, analysis by the Ecofin Agency indicates a consistent upward trend over the last decade.

From a modest 16% in 2013, internet usage in Africa climbed to 25% by 2016 and continued to grow steadily to reach 40% in 2022. Before the 2023 dip, the only other decline over the past ten years occurred in 2017, when usage dropped by 3.3 percentage points.

Several factors contributed to the surge between 2020 and 2022, notably the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced many activities online, thus increasing internet usage.

While the ITU does not provide specific reasons for the decrease between 2022 and 2023, several factors could be responsible, including the resumption of physical activities, internet blackouts in certain countries, and access issues elsewhere. In August 2023, disruptions in internet service in some African countries were attributed to the cutting of the WACS and SAT-3 submarine cables.

**Bridging the gap to global averages**

The 2023 data from the ITU indicates significant room for progress in Africa. While the continent reported a 37% internet usage rate, the global average stood at 67%. Meanwhile, Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and the Americas recorded internet usage rates between 87 and 91%. The Arab States and the Asia-Pacific region are closer to the global average, with rates of 69 and 66%, respectively.

Enhanced connectivity could significantly boost various economic sectors. An increase in the African online population could revolutionize sectors such as e-commerce. According to TechCabal Insights' ""Future of Commerce: Outlook for 2024"" report, the e-commerce sector is booming, with total revenue reaching $32.49 billion in 2022 and 387.5 million African online shoppers.

Despite having 25 submarine cables and 1.2 million km of terrestrial fiber, Africa's optical fiber footprint remains limited. Many countries still lack the necessary high-speed telecommunications infrastructure. Furthermore, Africa has the highest fixed broadband access rates in the world, costing an average of 14.8% of Gross National Income (GNI), far above the ITU's recommended 2%.

To enhance internet access in Africa, the Internet Society has made several recommendations. These include reforming the telecom market to encourage the emergence of competing access networks and expanding national basic infrastructures beyond major submarine cable landing points and primary population centers to additional population hubs.","The article discusses the rise of internet connectivity in Africa and mentions disruptions caused by the cutting of submarine cables, specifically the WACS and SAT-3 cables.

This mention is significant as it directly relates to the impact on internet service in various countries.

Although the primary focus of the article is on internet usage trends, the reference to cut submarine cables and their implications for connectivity indicates that the topic is addressed in a meaningful way.

For the past seven years, Marshallese people have accessed the internet through a super-speed cable that mostly carries US military traffic.

But now it needs repairs and a planned 10-day outage — that was due to finish at the weekend — has been extended without any definite end date because finding the source of the problem has proven difficult.

""I've been told that locating the repair site is like finding a pin head in a three-mile stretch of cable,"" the head of the National Telecommunications Authority, Tommy Kijiner Jr told Pacific Beat.

To make sure the country is not entirely cut off, authorities have reverted to satellite backup, which is providing just 3 per cent of the bandwidth Marshallese are used to.

Access to all websites, including all social media, has been blocked off and the limited bandwidth is being used for email traffic and some business and government customers, on a rotating basis.

It means people have been forced to give up social media use ""cold turkey"".

President Hilda Heine told parliament many Marshallese were suffering internet withdrawal symptoms.

In her state of the nation address last week, President Dr Hilda Heine told parliament many Marshallese were suffering internet withdrawal symptoms.

""Our customers are no longer used to the limited bandwidth that our satellite offers — going down from 1,500 megabits per second to a total of 50 for the entire country is a bit revolutionary in itself,"" Mr Kijiner said.

""One of the things that our IT team has been trying to do while rotating the limited bandwidth that we're using is making sure that people do not go to their Facebook sites but that has been very difficult.  

""I guess it is human nature that people just want to check up on what's going on with their Facebook sites but it's been tough — people just cannot do without the speed and reliability the fibre optic cable affords them. It changes everything.""

Hannon Armstrong owns the $64 million, 2,900 kilometre fibre optic system that connects to Guam.

Mr Kijiner said that since the cable was laid in 2009, there had been debate about whether it was too expensive for a small country.

""I think for the first time our customers now appreciate what the fibre means — now businesses are saying we really need to have this,"" Mr Kijiner said.

One concern was that there would not be enough bandwidth for the Finance Ministry to process the Government payroll but after all other business customers were cleared from satellite access, the funds went through.

""I've got a 24/7 IT team working around the clock, making sure that those businesses that need to conduct whatever it is that they're doing, are able to do so,"" Mr Kijiner said.

""People here are quite patient — Marshallese by nature are very patient — and so when we tell them that you'll have to reschedule your transaction while we do this one, most people have been really cooperative and we're very thankful for that.""

Published on: 05 Jan 2025, 12:30 am  
  
A Finnish court has denied a request for the release of an oil tanker suspected by police of damaging an undersea power line and four telecommunications cables in the Baltic Sea last week.  
The incident was one of several since 2022 in which underwater critical infrastructure in the Baltic Sea has suffered suspicious damage. Baltic Sea nations are on high alert and NATO has said it will boost its presence in the Baltic Sea.  
Several police investigations are under way but no suspects have been brought to trial.  
  
**December 2024: Power and internet cables**  
The Estlink 2 undersea power cable connecting Finland and Estonia was damaged on December 25 along with four telecoms lines.  
Finland launched a sabotage investigation and on December 26 seized a tanker carrying Russian oil on suspicion it caused the damage by dragging its anchor.  
Finnish authorities said the Cook Islands-registered _Eagle S_ was part of a ""shadow fleet"" used to circumvent sanctions on Russian oil exports. The European Union said it condemns any deliberate destruction of Europe's infrastructure.  
The NATO military alliance said on December 27 it would boost its presence in the Baltic Sea region. The Kremlin said the same day that the ship's seizure was of little concern to it, and Russia has previously denied involvement in such incidents.  
Finnish police said on December 29 they had found tracks on the seabed where they suspect the _Eagle S_ of damaging the cables.  
The owner of the _Eagle S_, United Arab Emirates-based Caravella, on December 30 filed a request with the Helsinki District Court seeking the release of the ship, which was rejected on January 3, 2025.  
  
**November 2024: Baltic telecom cables**  
Two undersea fibre-optic communications cables located more than 100 nautical miles (about 200 kilometres) apart in the Baltic Sea were severed on November 17 and 18, raising suspicions of sabotage.  
A 218-kilometre internet link between Lithuania and Sweden's Gotland island went out of service at about 08:00 GMT on November 17, according to Lithuania's Telia Lietuva, part of Swedish Telia Company.  
A 1,200-kilometre cable connecting Helsinki to the German port of Rostock stopped working around 02:00 GMT on November 18, Finnish state-controlled cyber security and telecoms company Cinia said.  
Investigators in the countries involved have zeroed in on Chinese bulk carrier _Yi Peng 3_, which left the Russian port of Ust-Luga on Nov. 15, and a Reuters analysis of MarineTraffic data showed that the ship's coordinates corresponded to the time and place of the breaches.  
China allowed representatives from Germany, Sweden, Finland and Denmark on December 21 to board the _Yi Peng 3_ along with Chinese investigators, after a month-long diplomatic standoff during which the ship sat still in a Danish shipping lane.  
Swedish Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard said on December 23 China had not heeded the Swedish government's request for a prosecutor to be able to conduct the preliminary investigation on board.  
  
**October 2023: Balticconnector gas pipe and cables**  
A subsea gas pipeline, the Balticconnector, which links Finland and Estonia under the Baltic Sea, was severed by what Finnish investigators determined was Chinese container vessel _NewNew Polar Bear_ dragging its anchor in the early hours of October 8, 2023.  
Estonian police suspect the ship of also damaging telecoms cables connecting Estonia to Finland and Sweden on October 7-8, before hitting the gas pipeline on its way to a port near St Petersburg in Russia.  
China promised Finland and Estonia assistance with the investigations but Estonian authorities have said the Chinese did little to fulfil its promises.  
Finnish and Estonian investigators have been unable to determine whether the Hong Kong-flagged vessel caused the damage by accident or deliberately and have not yet provided their conclusions in the cases.  
  
**September 2022: Nord Stream Blasts**  
Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2, built across the Baltic Sea by Russia's state-controlled Gazprom to pump natural gas to Germany, were damaged on September 26, 2022.  
Swedish seismologists registered several subsea blasts, some 17 hours apart, off the Danish island of Bornholm, that ruptured three out of four pipelines in the Nord Stream system, releasing methane into the atmosphere.  
In the investigations, Sweden found traces of explosives on several objects recovered from the site, confirming it was a deliberate act, but Sweden and Denmark closed their investigations without naming suspects in 2024.  
No one has taken responsibility.  
Some Western officials have suggested Moscow blew up its own pipelines, an interpretation dismissed by Russian President Vladimir Putin.  
Russia has blamed the United States, Britain and Ukraine for the blasts, which largely cut Russian gas off from the European market. Those countries denied involvement.  
In August 2024, Germany asked Poland to arrest a Ukrainian diving instructor accused of being part of a team that blew up the Nord Stream pipelines. Poland said the man left the country before he could be detained.

Tanzania and the French Indian Ocean island of Mayotte were the hardest hit, the internet surveillance group said.

“The incident is attributed to failures affecting the SEACOM and EASSy subsea cable systems,” it said on X, formerly Twitter, referring to submarine communications cables that connect the region.

The faults were on cables between Mozambique and South Africa, according to Tanzania’s information and technology minister Nape Nnauye.

Mozambique and Malawi were seeing a medium impact while Burundi, Somalia, Rwanda, Uganda, Comoros and Madagascar had less severe outages, NetBlocks said.

West African nation Sierra Leone was also affected.

These incidents have immensely affected Internet use experiences of the Vietnamese lately like considerably slow speed, congestions, and even the inability to access websites with foreign servers.

Vietnam’s undersea internet cables break around 10 times a year on average, with each lasting for about a month.

The APG cable, officially launched in December 2016, is capable of providing bandwidths of up to 54 Tbps (Terabit per second). It runs 10,400 kilometers (6,460 miles) under the Pacific Ocean, linking Japan with Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.

#### Sometimes undersea internet cable attacked by sharks?
Sharks sometimes mistake undersea cables for prey and chew through them.

In the search for new subsea oil fields, geologists use large vessels to tow several heavy-duty cables (called streamer cables) to collect seismic data. Equipped with hydrophones that receive the returned signals initiated from a seismic source, these streamer cables are deployed at about 16 – 65 feet (5–20 meters) deep, and each streamer is typically 26,247 ft (8 km) long. As one can imagine, this activity probably attracts numerous animals to check out what the ruckus is all about. One of these animals are sharks, who are attracted to the magnetic streamer fields and tend to bite through the cables! In some areas of the world, equipment loss due to shark attacks on streamer cables is a serious problem in terms of time delays and economic loss for the operator.

This isn’t the first time sharks have caused a headache for undersea cable systems. According to Network World, even Google has had to wrap their internet cables in Kevlar-like material to prevent damaging shark bites. So why are sharks attracted to undersea data cables? It’s not exactly known. Some believe that because sharks can sense electromagnetic fields through jelly-filled pores on their snouts called ampullae of Lorenzini, perhaps they are attracted by this electrical current and confusing it for food. Alternatively, shark expert Dr. Chris Lowe from California State University suggested they may just be curious about them. “If you had just a piece of plastic out there shaped like a cable, there’s a good chance they’d bite that too,” said Dr. Lowe.

So what sharks are being naughty and making trouble? Multiple species, depending how deep the cables are at. But at this depth? One culprit may be bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) with their stout, grey bodies and short blunt snouts. A widely distributed shark in tropical and warm temperate waters worldwide, they are common in areas where oil companies have encountered problems with sharks attacking the streamer cables. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed bull sharks as Near Threatened (NT) because their occurrences in estuarine and freshwater areas makes them vulnerable to human impacts.","The article discusses the APG undersea cable, detailing its breakdown and the resulting negative impact on internet connectivity in Vietnam.

Although an initial timeline for repair work was set at two to three days due to proximity of local cable ships and equipment, that’s now turned into a number of weeks.

Bangladesh Submarine Cables Company (BSCPLC)’s General Manager for operations and maintenance, Saidur Rahman, told local news stations “administrative work there (in Indonesia) takes a little longer,” and “the authorities said the repair work could be completed in the third or fourth week of next month.”

Despite becoming something of a subsea hub in South East Asia, with over 60 cables connected to its shores, Indonesia still has protectionist regulation around the repairs of cables carried out in its waters.

The government’s preferential cabotage policy requires cable repairs to be performed by Indonesian ships, manned with Indonesian crews.

Despite being located in a busy shipping region, with ample equipment vessels and crews nearby, delays to repairs have been seen before.

In 2022 the Sulawesi Maluku Papua Cable System (SMPCS) had to wait two months for a repair ship to start fixing it, as the vessel was carrying out works on another system, had to refuel and then travel to the cut on SMPCS.

While the SEA-ME-WE 5 cable is damaged, Bangladesh is relying on connectivity through its only other subsea system, SEA-ME-WE 4 and terrestrial fibre links, mostly imported through India.

Rahman said that SEA-ME-WE 4 would be able to make up the capacity lost on SEA-ME-WE 5, but the “concerned company” would need to pay for the additional bandwidth, which he said “is still not decided.”

Who exactly Rahman is referring to is unclear. According to TeleGeography’s submarine cable map, BSCCL is the only Bangladeshi company that is a consortium member on SEA-ME-WE 4.","The article titled ""Indonesian policy delays SEA-ME-WE 5’s repair"" discusses the damage to the SEA-ME-WE 5 undersea cable, which is a direct reference to a cut sea cable.

### Deployment Delays

As the [demand for international bandwidth](https://blog.telegeography.com/how-is-the-global-network-keeping-up-with-demand) continues to rise rapidly around the world, network operators are responding with investment in a large number of new cables. This includes several new projects in the Red Sea.

Even before the recent spate of rebel attacks on commercial shipping vessels, the Yemeni civil war created permitting headaches. Cable laying vessels require permits to enter a country’s territorial waters. When two different entities claim the same swath of sea, the situation becomes complicated.

The massive [2Africa](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/2africa) cable, which is largely laid, has yet to realize deployment of a large length of cable that would lie in Yemeni waters. Other cables planned to traverse the Red Sea in coming years include [IEX](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/india-europe-xpress-iex), [Africa-1](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/africa-1), [Raman](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/raman), and [SeaMeWe-6](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/seamewe-6).

Ensuring that these cables can be deployed is vital to meeting future demand requirements for East Africa, the Middle East, and India.

### Repair Risk

With deployment of new Red Sea cables in question, the importance of existing cables is further increased. Routine maintenance and cable repairs are required to keep these cables up and running.

In November, Global Cloud Xchange was able to complete [scheduled maintenance](https://managedservices.gcxworld.com/clarification-yemen-internet-outage/) on the company’s [FALCON](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/falcon) cable in Yemeni waters. However, future repairs may prove difficult if cables are damaged in areas with high levels of rebel activity.

After all, even if a cable repair ship is permitted to enter the waters and recover the damaged cable, completing a delicate repair may be difficult. This often requires cable ships to stay in one area for days.

Were a stationary cable ship to be attacked in the midst of a repair, evasive maneuvers may not be possible. Cable ship operators may therefore decide that these repairs are not worth risking their vessels and crew.

### Avoiding the Red Sea?

What happens if damage occurs to Red Sea cables that cannot be immediately repaired? In most cases, data can continue to flow using alternative systems and routes.

Gulf countries could access Europe via terrestrial network links to Saudi Arabia. India has links eastward to Singapore. East African countries could divert traffic up the West Coast of the continent. But you cannot quickly and completely reroute all existing traffic along other paths.

Imagine the impact of rerouting traffic from a closed six-lane highway to a two-lane road. Network quality would suffer depending on the number and capacities of cables damaged.

Hopefully, the situation in this part of the world will stabilize in the near-term. Until then, risks will persist for existing and planned cables in the Red Sea.","The article discusses the importance of subsea cables in the Red Sea, detailing their role in global communications and the risks they face due to attacks by Yemeni Houthi rebels.

Cuba seems to have started accepting internet traffic through an underwater cable, not just the slow and limited satellites it's relied on for years. Traffic monitoring company Renesys said yesterday that it had detected a new connection between Spanish ISP Telefonica and the state-owned Cuban telecommunications company, with lower latencies than would be possible through the aging satellite system — though overall speeds are still quite slow. That would be a first step towards real connectivity in a country with the worst internet in Latin America, even if it's still unlikely ordinary people would be able to get access.

Like North Korea, Cuba limits most people to a local, more tightly controlled intranet. What's more, Renesys reports that this new connection is only operational in one direction: whether by design or mistake, traffic can come in via cable, but outgoing information must use the slower satellite system. The cable that's likely being used runs from Cuba to Venezuela; it was first announced in 2009 and meant to be operational around 2011, connecting Cuba to the larger underwater network.

For years, though, its actual status has been a mystery. In mid-2012, the Miami Herald reported that it was operational but only being used for strategic government communications, while Reuters reported soon after that there was no evidence the cable was in use. Cuba has previously blamed its poor internet connectivity on the US embargo. Now, Renesys notes that it started noticing traffic on the cable the same day Cuba dropped its requirement for exit visas, saying it could be part of a general move towards greater openness.

Australian carriers that rely on the cable for inter-Asia connectivity reported that the repairs had been completed at 8.21am AEDT this morning.

This was about five days later than first anticipated, owing to the need to repair a series of faults on the cable rather than just the initial one discovered back on August 30.

The cable ship Asean Explorer spent the past few days making the final reconnections off the coast of Jakarta, Indonesia.

Australian internet traffic has also been affected over the same period by additional subsea cable breakages off the coast of Hong Kong in the wake of powerful typhoons that swept through the area.

ISPs including iiNet this morning revealed those links had been successfully repaired on September 30.

“The link has remained stable and we have now resumed direct peering traffic for Singapore, Hong Kong and other Asian destinations,” iiNet said.

The reconnection of the cables means that much Australian internet traffic into SE Asia will no longer have to be routed across the Pacific via the United States, reducing service latency.

2Africa, among the longest subsea cable systems in the world, spanning over 45,000 km, has investments from Bharti Airtel and Meta, among others. It will have a capacity of 180 terabits per second (tbps), connecting 33 countries, including Sunil Mittal-led Airtel’s landing station in Mumbai. IAX and IEX involve contributions from Reliance Jio, among others.

IAX and IEX will be landing at Mumbai and Chennai, respectively, reinforcing India’s weight in the global telecom market. IEX will have a capacity of over 200 tbps, covering 9,775 km from Mumbai to the Persian Gulf and further to Europe. IAX will also have a capacity of more than 200 tbps, extending more than 16,000 kms, starting from Mumbai, and connecting Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Sri Lanka.

Experts said the three projects combined will significantly enhance capacity, besides improving the quality of internet services for applications such as 5G video streaming, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and cloud computing, helping draw large scale investments from data centre operators.

India had 17 international subsea cables landing in 14 distinct stations in five cities, with a cumulative lit capacity of 138.55 tbps and activated capacity of 111.11 tbps as of 2023, according to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).

This March, 15 prominent subsea cables were damaged by Yemen-based Houthi rebels in the Red Sea, disrupting global internet. Instability in Yemen in the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war impeded immediate restoration efforts by operators.

With a user base of 1.2 billion, India has emerged as one of the world's largest telecom markets, with average per capita data consumption of 24.1 gigabytes (GB) per month, up 24% on year, according to Nokia's Mobile Broadband Index. Increased data sovereignty and security needs are also nudging enterprises to run data centres in India. This is reflected in hyperscalers such as Microsoft and Google making large investments to own and operate data centres in the country.

India’s strategic location in the Indo-Pacific region, along with its recent data centre developments, has poised the country to be a leader in the region for data hosting and data traffic flows. The subsea industry is seeing a major resurgence — 107 new cables were built during 2016-20, representing $13.8 billion in value, with another $18 billion in subsea cable investments underway from 2021 to 2025, Nagpal said.","The article titled ""Improved internet quality ahead: New subsea cable routes to widen India’s data highway"" discusses new subsea cable projects that are set to enhance internet connectivity in India.

Their Vava’u and Ha’apai telephone and internet services are surviving on low bandwidth backup satellite capacity, which at peak times has lower than normal capacity and quality.

The two outer island groups north of Tongatapu, have suffered poor telephone and internet services since June 29, when the inter-island domestic submarine cable went dark.

The local network providers, TCC and Digicel restored some of their services to Vava’u and Ha’apai using satellites.

TCC CEO Sione Veikoso told _Matangi Tonga_ that their service quality drops during peak times, but after peak hours the network operation was normal.

“The mobile network has been fully restored with both voice and mobile internet. During peak times the service quality degrades and is not as good as when the fibre cable was still connected.”

“As for fixed lines services, the landline voice has been fully restored,” he said.

“In addition to this for fixed internet customers we provide satellite VSAT terminals for some of the customers whom wish to use this option both in Ha’apai and Vava’u,” he said.

Meanwhile, Digicel CEO, Daniel Horan said their services had been close to their normal capacity, since last Friday, 02 August.

“As with the submarine cable, when that was broken we added a satellite service to Vava’u to get it up and running in about half [bandwidth capacity] what we previously had. I’m very pleased to say that we’ve increased that so now, we’re back up to somewhat close to what we originally had, from a bandwidth perspective.”

He said that customers in Vava’u could now get Digicel, 4G, 3G, and 2G.

Ha’apai had already got their services operating because it’s a smaller market, and was easier, whereas for Vava’u, it was 10 – 15 times bigger and more complex to fix.

“So that has taken a little bit more time. But yes, it’s all back to normal from a customer’s perspective. You should be able to do all your normal video, YouTube, all of that sort of good stuff.”

“From our perspective right now, which I think maybe slightly different to some other companies, we’re more or less back to normal.”

Daniel said they would run that service for as long as it takes until the submarine cable is fixed.

“We’re hoping obviously that Tonga cable will be able to fix the submarine cable sometime in the next few weeks.”

TCC CEO Sione Veikoso said the satellite back-up capacity TCC is paying for, is more expensive than what they paid for fibre services. Meanwhile, the cable repair ship CS Lodbrog had departed Fiji and was on its way to Tonga, and was expected to arrive Wednesday, Tonga Cable ACEO, Sosafate Kolo, said.","The article titled 'Vava’u and Ha’apai communications services survive on backup satellites as cable awaits repair' discusses the impact of a broken submarine cable on telecommunications in Tonga.

There is a popular expression in Cuba that is synonymous with difficulty and crisis. When you want to indicate that someone is doing badly economically, it is sufficient to say that he is “eating a cable.” Street humor has identified the act of chewing and swallowing a bundle of wires with scarcity and material want. The parable has gained strength these days in reference to the fiber-optic cable installed between Cuba and Venezuela, which has yet to provide service to Cuban clients despite reports that it is finally functioning.

In 2007, Cuba and Venezuela began working on installation of the Alba-1 submarine cable, named for the Spanish acronym of the Bolivarian Alternative for the Countries of Our America. At the cost of $70 million and after a series of delays, the cable touched ground in Santiago de Cuba in February 2011. However, the island continued to use satellite providers for what little Internet service was available. In the two years since, government media has been silent about the cable, generating rumors of a possible failure due to mismanagement or the diversion of resources.

Three weeks ago, an expert at Renesys, a U.S. firm that analyzes Internet traffic, suggested in his blog that the Alba-1 cable had started showing activity. At first, traffic was detectable in only one direction, but after several days he had confirmed the sending and receiving of data. Doug Madory, a Renesys research engineer, said the Spanish company Telefónica SA had begun to direct Internet traffic to the government-owned Internet service provider ETECSA. Telefónica denied it was supplying routing services for the Alba-1, but confirmed that it was providing other services to ETECSA.

The expert said lower Internet latencies to Cuba could be evidence that the island is using other sources of access in addition to the satellites. “While activation of the Alba-1 could be a good way to improve ETECSA’s links to the Internet, Cuba will probably continue to be unable to provide a wide range of network access,” Madory wrote on Renesys’s website.

According to official statistics, 23 of every 100 inhabitants on the island have access to the Internet. That figure has been heavily criticized and put in doubt by many analysts, who say that the rate includes users of the country’s intranet, where no websites are available that dissent from the regime. Studies have ranked Cuba in last place in Latin America for international Internet connectivity with a rate of only 3 percent, but even that number seems optimistic.

In the two weeks since the first signs of cable activity, there has been no perceptible change in connectivity for users in work or educational centers. Nor, as far as can be proved, has the speed increased in the few Internet cafés that exist in Havana. With prices ranging between 5 and 10 euros (about US$7 to US$13) per hour, hotels continue to offer extremely slow connections to the Internet and many sites are blocked.

The same day the Alba-1 activity was reported, a young man who was waiting outside a crowded Internet café in Old Havana was surprised by the information provided by Renesys. “Now how will they explain why we have to pay so much for an hour of connection?” he asked. The various people waiting their turn for a computer concurred.

The independent journalist Frank Abel Garcia, whose tweets under the handle @FrankAbelCuba are published only via text messages, was skeptical about the news. “I think there is no interest or political will on the part of the government for the people to have Internet access.” In his estimation, if the cable was activated on a massive scale it could be a “strong blow to state propaganda. It would open the eyes of a lot of people in regards to what happens in the world and in our own country.”

The official media, as usual, have been silent, and television programs continue to depict the Internet as a conglomerate of violence, pornography, and false information. But many young people seem excited and anxious about the latest details on the cable that have appeared in the international press. Perhaps the great World Wide Web is closer than it appears.

Yoani Sánchez is a pioneer in the Cuban blogger community. _Time_ magazine listed her as one of the world’s 100 most influential people in 2008. In 2009, she received a Maria Moors Cabot citation from Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism.","The article discusses the Alba-1 submarine cable, detailing its installation, challenges in providing service, and its implications for internet connectivity in Cuba.

*   **Only one cable-laying ship is allowed to tackle repairs needed to the broken undersea fibre-optic cable segments in the Congo Canyon.**
*   **The snapped cables are causing internet disruptions in South Africa.**
*   **But the Léon Thévenin is carrying out repairs near Kenya on the east coast of Africa – more than 8 000 kilometres away - before it heads to the Congo Canyon.**

The only underwater cable-laying ship authorised to tackle the repair of undersea cables in the whole of sub-Saharan Africa is still more than 8 000 kilometres away from the site where two cables, critical to the provision of internet services in South Africa, snapped on the same day.

The Léon Thévenin is just off the coast of Kenya, on the east coast of Africa. The West Africa Cable System (WACS) and the South Atlantic Telecommunications Cable number three (SAT-3) snapped on the west coast of Africa, off the coast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

News24 had a look at the position of the ship on Marine Traffic, a maritime analytics provider, and saw that it was still located off the coast of Kenya, where it is involved in another marine repair.

The repair vessel will have to make the more than 8 000-kilometre journey around the southern tip of the continent.

The two underwater fibre-optic cables snapped on 6 August, allegedly due to a rockfall in the Congo Canyon.

Various companies in South Africa and along the west coast of the continent rely on the cables for internet services.

Since the cables play a crucial role in enabling the rapid transfer of information across long distances, internet disruptions have been experienced.

David Belson, the head of data insight at Cloudflare, one of the biggest networks operating on the internet, said websites hosted in the US or Europe may feel slow or not work at all in South Africa because of the break.

""This will make websites feel slower, or just not work at all. Networks are actively working on bringing up new capacity to deal with the cut, while work is under way to repair the break, which may take weeks to repair,"" Belson said.

**No alternatives**  
Jess Auerbach, an associate professor at the University of Cape Town's Graduate School of Business, who is in the process of writing a book about fibrer-optic cables, said the Léon Thévenin was the only ship authorised to tend to the subsea cables of sub-Saharan Africa.

There are other ships for repairs to subsea cables, according to Auerbach, but there are legal arrangements and cost factors involved, which mean that they can't be used for the repairs on many African cable segments, including the portion of WACS and SAT-3 that are damaged.

Thus, the companies that rent capacity on WACS and SAT-3 will have to wait for the Léon Thévenin to finish its current job and travel to the Congo Canyon.

In the meantime, many companies have been able to reroute the traffic that would normally be serviced on the WACS and SAT-3 cables to other subsea cables.

**The repair**
Auerbach explained that the process that will likely be followed to repair the cables once the ship has made the voyage to the DRC.

The Léon Thévenin has a remote-controlled submersible on board which will be deployed to retrieve the cable from the sea floor.

The subsea cables look a little bit like a garden hosepipe and contain many high-quality glass threads that can carry vast quantities of information very quickly over long distances. These threads are encased in other materials.

Once the cable is above water, there is a team of skilled technicians on board the vessel who will assess the work that needs to be done, and the damaged cable section will be repaired on the ship.

**Africa underserved**
In recent months, Google and Meta have landed new subsea cables on South African shores that run along the west coast of the continent.

Auerbach said that the number of cables around the continent was increasing rapidly, which means that more breaks in the cables can be expected.

This means that the lack of repair infrastructure and maintenance skills may need to be reconsidered going forward, she added.

She said:
At the moment I think it fair to say that Africa is radically underserved.

""There is a lack of available infrastructure at the levels of repairs and maintenance,"" said Auerbach.

She said that the lack of capacity to deal with cable breaks was driven by the lack of the repair ships themselves, a shortage of expertise and the legal structures that need to be in place to undertake repairs.

The vessels are very expensive pieces of infrastructure, she said.

**Wait time**
Vodacom spokesperson Byron Kennedy, said WACS and SAT-3 were expected to be repaired by 8 September, ""weather permitting"".

Until then, South Africans might experience some internet complication, especially during peak usage times.","The article titled ""Only one cable-laying ship can fix snapped underwater cables and it's still on the other side of Africa"" discusses the recent snapping of two undersea cables, the West Africa Cable System (WACS) and the South Atlantic Telecommunications Cable (SAT-3), which has caused significant internet disruptions in South Africa.

It mentions that these cables snapped on August 6, allegedly due to a rockfall in the Congo Canyon, and emphasizes the importance of these cables for internet connectivity.

The article details the logistical challenges of repairing these cables, noting that the only cable-laying ship authorized to make the repairs, the Léon Thévenin, is currently engaged in another repair operation over 8,000 kilometers away in Kenya.

This situation illustrates the critical role these undersea cables play in telecommunications and the direct impact of their damage on internet services.

Executive director of international operations and services Darrin Webb said in a [blog post](https://exchange.telstra.com.au/2017/01/12/protecting-subsea-cable-network/) that the telco particularly had issues around Singapore and Hong Kong.

Both cities are major landing points for cables in the region, but are also two of Asia’s busiest “and shallowest” container ports, Webb said.

The telco has a dedicated team that uses a ship’s Automatic Identification System (AIS) – which provides an identification number, position, course and speed for each vessel – to determine where each is in relation to subsea cables in the area.

“If a ship gets too close, our team will make a call to the captain so they can adjust their course,” Webb said.

“On average, our team contacts 30 – 50 container ships a month.”

Webb said the telco also used other methods to protect its subsea infrastructure in the region.

These included employing “out of season fishing crews to monitor areas susceptible to regular damage”, thought to be caused by unregulated fishing boats.

He said Telstra had – in some areas – buried cables “up to three metres below the seabed to avoid being hit by anchors”, or had overland cable redundancy in disaster-prone areas, where the impact of earthquakes or typhoons might damage subsea infrastructure.

Japan’s NTT Communications, representing a partnership of major telcos in nine Asian countries, announced this week the commencement of service over the Asia Pacific Gateway (APG), a 10,400-kilometer span of fiber optic cable.

NTT boasts a theoretical capacity for APG of 54 terabits per second — much higher than the partnership’s original goal of 40 Tbps. However, Greg’s Cable Map, which depicts live data for submarine cable operations worldwide, lists its operational capacity at 38.4 Tbps.

Still, the news will have already sparked celebrations in Vietnam, whose Internet service has been plagued by service problems ever since the Asia America Gateway cable (AAG) was launched in November 2009. AAG has suffered from numerous ruptures, and finally efforts to repair it were indefinitely canceled last March, after repair crews reported they could not find the rupture point.

**Southeast Asia Gets a Boost**

APG will link Da Nang with both Osaka and Tokyo. From both points, NTT will manage junctions to the existing PC-1 loop, a 640 Gbps cable connecting Grover Beach, California, and Harbor Pointe, Washington. Still, PC-1 has been in active service since 2001, and sub-terabit speed is not perceived as broad enough to support an Asia-based video service to North America.

Other municipalities being linked by APG are: Chongming, Nanhui District, and Tseung Kwan O in Hong Kong’s Sai Kung District, China; Kuantan, Malaysia; Songhkla, Thailand; Tanah Merah, Singapore; Toucheng, Taiwan; and Busan, South Korea. It’s there where Korea Telecom (one of APG’s partners) opened a major Submarine Network Operation Center (SNOC) facility last June.

Since South Korea will be the host country of the 2018 Winter Olympics, KT has an interest in being able to deliver multiple channels of live, Ultra-HD resolution video, capable of reaching all points of the globe at 5G speeds.

Three years ago, the Southeast Asia-Japan Cable (SJC) became operational, thanks in no small part to a considerable investment by Google. Theoretical capacity for SJC is 23 Tbps. But while it links Japan with China, Brunei, Singapore, and the Philippines, it skips over Vietnam and South Korea.

**Where Facebook Goes, Conspiracy Follows**

Facebook made an investment — albeit of undisclosed value — in the construction of APG in 2012. Whenever Facebook gets into a new industry, either it immediately sparks controversy, or someone finds a controversy and attributes it to Facebook.

In this case, a regional tech publication speculated at the time whether Facebook had specific designs on the Asian market. Had Facebook secured a special agreement with the Chinese government to sidestep its national firewalls and censorship boundaries, for instance?

One of these conspiracies has since been put soundly to rest: the question of why Facebook would invest in a cable project with no ties to America. As we noted, NTT will handle the junction between Osaka, Tokyo, and two points on the American West Coast.

But last May, Facebook teamed up with Microsoft to invest in the construction of an all-new submarine cable across the Pacific Ocean. Dubbed MAREA, this first new cable will be operated by Telxius Telecom, a new division of Spanish telco Telefónica. In its announcement at the time, Telxius boasted an incredible capacity goal of 160 Tbps, some 256 times greater than PC-1.

And just last month, Facebook and Google were named as co-investors in a separate submarine project, a 120 Tbps line dubbed PLCN.

But one of the many 2012 Facebook conspiracies actually does still hold water, if only a few ounces: Is Facebook interested in ensuring its Internet traffic across the Pacific steers clear of Russia, or perhaps Africa?

It sounds like the basis for an Ian Fleming novel, were he still with us (some say he’s gone into hiding), but it is a surprisingly legitimate question. For the last decade, Russia has put forth proposals to the U.N.’s International Telecommunications Union that would put a consortium of state-run telecom regulators in an oversight role over Internet traffic.

While countries participating in a 2014 meeting mostly decided not to take that route, ITU study groups, operating under the auspices of Smart Cities and Internet of Things initiatives, are managing to raise the issue yet again. And at an ITU conference in Tunisia just last week, the African Telecommunications Union raised the issue once again, in the form of proposed regulations for the makers of phone apps that could potentially be played on over-the-top (OTT) digital TV tuners.

Russian telecom officials are on record as supporting the rights of nations, as Internet stakeholders, to impose tariffs on certain types of traffic entering their territories — for example, taxing servers that spam citizens’ browsers. Were such tariffs to become enforceable as law (not an impossibility, given the apparently cozy relationship between one U.S. presidential candidate and Russia), theoretically, Facebook could become liable whenever a Facebook user posts material that a Russian regulation defines as “spam.”

It would give a firm with the resources and capital of Facebook (or Microsoft, or Google) good reason to devote extra resources to hard-wiring the Internet, bypassing countries that would impose such tariffs. The irony here is that China, in such a scenario, would be cast as the hero of free speech rights. In any event, it’s not a bad reason, and at the very least a good excuse, to open wider channels of digital transactions across the Pacific.","The article discusses submarine cables in detail, particularly the Asia Pacific Gateway (APG) and the Asia America Gateway (AAG).

"The Most Vulnerable Place on the Internet","Millions offline due to the AAE-1 cable cut in Egypt, causing widespread internet blackouts.","https://www.wired.com/story/submarine-internet-cables-egypt","2022-11-02T12:00:00.000Z","",Yes,"Matt Burgess","San Francisco, California, USA",-,"2022-11-02","English","WIRED","### The Most Vulnerable Place on the Internet

The Asia-Africa-Europe-1 internet cable travels 15,500 miles along the seafloor, connecting Hong Kong to Marseille, France. As it snakes through the South China Sea and toward Europe, the cable helps provide internet connections to more than a dozen countries, from India to Greece. When the cable was cut on June 7, millions of people were plunged offline and faced temporary internet blackouts.

The cable, also known as AAE-1, was severed where it briefly passes across land through Egypt. One other cable was also damaged in the incident, with the cause of the damage unknown. However, the impact was immediate. “It affected about seven countries and a number of over-the-top services,” says Rosalind Thomas, the managing director of SAEx International Management, which plans to create a new undersea cable connecting Africa, Asia, and the US. “The worst was Ethiopia, that lost 90 percent of its connectivity, and Somalia thereafter also 85 percent.” Cloud services belonging to Google, Amazon, and Microsoft were all also disrupted, subsequent analysis revealed.

While connectivity was restored in a few hours, the disruption highlights the fragility of the world’s 550-plus subsea internet cables, plus the outsized role Egypt and the nearby Red Sea have in the internet’s infrastructure. The global network of underwater cables forms a large part of the internet’s backbone, carrying the majority of data around the world and eventually linking up to the networks that power cell towers and Wi-Fi connections. Subsea cables connect New York to London and Australia to Los Angeles.

Sixteen of these submarine cables—which are often no thicker than a hosepipe and are vulnerable to damage from ships’ anchors and earthquakes—pass 1,200 miles through the Red Sea before they hop over land in Egypt and get to the Mediterranean Sea, connecting Europe to Asia. The last two decades have seen the route emerge as one of the world’s largest internet chokepoints and, arguably, the internet’s most vulnerable place on Earth. (The region, which also includes the Suez Canal, is also a global choke point for shipping and the movement of goods. Chaos ensued when the container ship _Ever Given_ got wedged in the canal in 2021.)

“Where there are chokepoints, there are single points of failure,” Nicole Starosielski, an associate professor of media, culture, and communication at New York University and an author on submarine cables. “Because it's a site of intense concentration of global movement, that does make it more vulnerable than many places around the world.”

The area has also recently gained attention from the European Parliament, which in a June report highlighted it as a risk for widespread internet disruption. “The most vital bottleneck for the EU concerns the passage between the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean via the Red Sea because the core connectivity to Asia runs via this route,” the report says, flagging extremism and maritime terrorism are risks in the area.

**Pyramid Scheme**

Look at Egypt on a map of the world’s subsea internet cables and it immediately becomes clear why internet experts have been concerned about the area for years. The 16 cables in the area are concentrated through the Red Sea and touch land in Egypt, where they make a 100-mile journey across the country to reach the Mediterranean Sea. (Cable maps don’t show the exact locations of cables.)

It has been estimated that around 17 percent of the world’s internet traffic travels along these cables and passes through Egypt. Alan Mauldin, the research director of telecoms market research firm TeleGeography, says last year the region had 178 terabits of capacity, or 178,000,000 Mbps—the US has median home internet speeds of 167 Mbps.

Egypt has become one of the internet’s most prominent chokepoints for a few reasons, says Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at monitoring firm Kentik. Primarily, its geography contributes to the concentration of cables in the area. Passing through the Red Sea and across Egypt is the shortest (mostly) underwater route between Asia and Europe. While some intercontinental internet cables travel across land, it is generally safer for them to be placed at the bottom of the sea where it is harder for them to be disrupted or snooped upon.","The article titled ""The Most Vulnerable Place on the Internet"" discusses the cutting of the AAE-1 submarine internet cable in Egypt, which directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables.

It describes how the cable was severed on June 7, leading to millions of people experiencing temporary internet blackouts.

This incident exemplifies the implications and effects of cut sea cables on internet connectivity, fulfilling the criterion for being an article on this topic.

The mention of the cable being damaged and the resulting impact on telecommunications supports the evaluation that the article treats cut sea cables as a central theme rather than a minor mention."

Cables belonging to four major telecoms networks have been “cut” causing “significant” disruption to communications networks in the Middle East, according to Hong Kong telecoms company HGC Global Communications.

HGC estimates that 25% of traffic between Asia and Europe as well the Middle East has been impacted, it said in a statement Monday.

The company said it is rerouting traffic to minimize disruption for customers and also “extending assistance to affected businesses.”

HGC did not say how the cables had been damaged or who was responsible.

South Africa-based Seacom, which owns one of the cable systems affected, told CNN that repairs wouldn’t begin for at least another month, partly because of the length of time it takes to secure permits to operate in the area.

Underwater cables are the invisible force driving the internet, with many funded in recent years by internet giants such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook parent Meta. Damage to these subsea networks can cause widespread internet outages, as happened following the Taiwan earthquake in 2006.

The destruction of cables in the Red Sea comes weeks after the official Yemeni government warned of the possibility that Houthi rebels would target the cables. The Iranian-backed militants have already disrupted global supply chains by attacking commercial vessels in the crucial waterway.

Reports last week from Israeli news outlet Globes suggested the Houthis had been behind the damage to the cables.

Yemeni rebel leader Abdel Malek al-Houthi denied the allegations. “We have no intention of targeting sea cables providing internet to countries in the region,” he said.

The Houthis have since blamed British and US military units operating in the area for the damage, according to a report Saturday by the rebels’ official news agency. CNN has contacted the UK and US governments for comment.

Seacom’s chief digital officer Prenesh Padayachee said acquiring permits from the Yemeni maritime authority to repair the cables could take up to eight weeks. “Client traffic will continue to be rerouted until we are able to repair the damaged cable,” he added.

Among the other networks affected is Asia-Africa-Europe 1, a 25,000-kilometer (15,534-mile) cable system connecting South East Asia to Europe via Egypt. The Europe India Gateway (EIG) has also been damaged.

EIG connects Europe, the Middle East and India and counts Vodafone as a major investor. Vodafone, a large mobile network operator in the United Kingdom, declined to comment.

The company says on its website that it can send internet traffic across some 80 submarine cable systems that reach 100 countries.

Most large telecoms companies rely on multiple undersea cable systems, allowing them to reroute traffic in the event of an outage to ensure uninterrupted service.","The article titled ""Red Sea cables have been damaged, disrupting internet traffic"" provides a detailed account of damage to submarine cables in the Red Sea, which is a direct reference to the topic of cut sea cables.

Three cables under the Red Sea that provide global internet and telecommunications have been cut as the waterway remains a target of Yemen’s Houthi rebels, officials said Monday. Meanwhile, a Houthi missile attack set a ship ablaze in the Gulf of Aden, but caused no injuries.

What cut the lines remains unclear. There has been concern about the cables being targeted in the Houthi campaign, which the rebels describe as an effort to pressure Israel to end its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The Houthis have denied attacking the lines, however.

While global shipping has already been disrupted through the Red Sea, a crucial route for cargo and energy shipments from Asia and the Middle East to Europe, the sabotage of telecommunication lines could further escalate the monthslong crisis.

The cut lines include Asia-Africa-Europe 1, the Europe India Gateway, Seacom and TGN-Gulf, Hong Kong-based HGC Global Communications said. It described the cuts as affecting 25 per cent of the traffic flowing through the Red Sea. It described the Red Sea route as crucial for data moving from Asia to Europe and said it had begun rerouting traffic.

HGC Global Communications described the Seacom-TGN-Gulf line as being two separate cables when it is actually one at the area of the cut, according to Tim Stronge, a subsea cable expert with TeleGeography, a Washington-based telecommunications market research company.

Responding to questions from The Associated Press, Seacom said that “initial testing indicates the affected segment lies within Yemeni maritime jurisdictions in the Southern Red Sea.” It said it was rerouting the traffic that it was able to change, though some services were down.

Tata Communications, part of the Indian conglomerate and behind the Seacom-TGN-Gulf line, told AP that it “initiated immediate and appropriate remedial actions” after the line was cut.

“We invest in various cable consortiums to increase our diversity and hence in such situations of a cable cut or snag, we are able to automatically reroute our services,” Tata said.

Other firms behind those lines, which provide data to Africa, Asia and the Middle East, didn't respond to AP's queries.

In early February, Yemen's internationally recognized government in exile alleged that the Houthis planned to attack the cables. The lines appeared to have been cut on Feb. 24, with the organization NetBlocks noticing internet access in the East African nation of Djibouti suffering from interruptions two days later. Seacom serves Djibouti.

But for their part, the Houthis have denied targeting the cables. The rebels blamed the disruptions on British and U.S. military operations, but didn't offer evidence to support the allegation and have made false claims in the past.

Since November, the rebels have repeatedly targeted ships in the Red Sea and surrounding waters over the Israel-Hamas war. Those vessels have included at least one with cargo bound for Iran, the Houthis’ main benefactor, and an aid ship later bound for Houthi-controlled territory.

Despite more than a month and a half of U.S.-led airstrikes, Houthi rebels have remained capable of launching significant attacks. They include the attack last month on a cargo ship carrying fertilizer, the Rubymar, which sank on Saturday after drifting for several days, and the downing of an American drone worth tens of millions of dollars.

The Houthis insist their attacks will continue until Israel stops its combat operations in the Gaza Strip, which have enraged the wider Arab world and seen the Houthis gain international recognition.

Meanwhile, the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center on Monday separately warned of a new attack in the Gulf of Aden. The private security firm Ambrey described the vessel targeted as a Liberia-flagged, Israel-affiliated container ship that sustained damage and issued a distress call.

“The container ship reportedly encountered two explosions of which the first occurred at a ‘distance’ off its port quarter, while the second damaged the vessel’s accommodation block and a container leading,” Ambrey said. “The explosion further led to a fire onboard and the crew’s firefighting efforts were underway.”

Ambrey and the UKMTO said no crew member on the ship had been injured in the blaze, which was extinguished several hours later.

Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesman, claimed the attack in a prerecorded statement. He identified the ship as the MSC Sky II, sailing for the Switzerland-based firm Mediterranean Shipping Co, but sought to link the vessel to Israel. The ship's details and last-known location corresponded to details about the attack.

The Houthis “will continue to prevent Israeli navigation or those heading to the ports of occupied Palestine until the aggression is stopped and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted,” Saree said.

The U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, which patrols the Middle East, and MSC didn't respond to questions about the attack.

It remains unclear how the Houthis could attack subsea cables themselves. The rebels aren't known to have the diving or salvage capability to target the lines, which sit hundreds of meters below the surface of the waterway.

However, subsea cables can be cut by anchors, including those dropped from some of the ships that have been disabled in attacks. A drifting ship with its anchor scraping the sea could be the culprit.

“Our team thinks it is plausible that it could have been affected by anchor dragging, due to the amount of marine traffic the region deals with and the low seabed in many parts of the Red Sea,” Seacom said. “This can only be confirmed once the repair ship is on site.”

There are 14 cables now running through the Red Sea, with another six planned, said Stronge, the subsea cable expert.

“We estimate that over 90% of communications between Europe and Asia traverse submarine cables in the Red Sea,” he said. “Fortunately, telecom operators have built a high degree of redundancy into the system — there are many cables traversing the Red Sea.”

The Houthis later warned any cable-laying ship entering Yemeni waters needed a permit from the rebels “out of concern for its safety.”","The article titled ""Three Red Sea data cables cut as Houthis launch more attacks in the vital waterway"" provides a thorough discussion on the cutting of undersea cables in the Red Sea.

It mentions that three cables, including the Asia-Africa-Europe 1 and the Europe India Gateway, were cut, impacting global internet and telecommunications.

The article explicitly states that these cables are crucial for data moving from Asia to Europe and that the cuts affect 25% of the traffic through the Red Sea.

Furthermore, it discusses the implications of these cuts amidst ongoing Houthi attacks, indicating that the topic of cut sea cables is central rather than a minor mention.

**KARACHI:** Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) is set to invest in another international submarine cable consortium system expected to be operational in the last quarter of 2015, said a press release on Friday.

This will be the fourth submarine cable system by PTCL – a subsidiary of United Arab Emirate’s Etisalat – representing a multimillion dollar investment, the broadband giant said in an official statement, however the total investment was not disclosed.

The new cable, to be laid in collaboration with leading operators in the region, will be span from the Far East to Europe, with multiple landing points in the Middle East.

“With this cable, PTCL will be adding terabits of bandwidth to its international capacity, along with increasing its existing international infrastructure on the eastern and western side of the Arabian Sea,” the statement said.

This investment will help the company cater to growing demand from both retail consumers and businesses in the country for broadband and data services. The new cable link synergizes with PTCL’s three existing cable consortium systems: South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 3 (SMW3), South East Asia-Middle-East Western Europe 4 (MW4) and India-Middle East-Western Europe (I-ME-WE) which connect Pakistan with rest of the world.

“It is anticipated that the agreement will be signed before the end of this year and the cable will be operational as early as in the last quarter of 2015,” the statement said referring to a recent consortium meeting attended by a high level PTCL delegation to finalise the details of the project.

This new cable system is expected to further boost the proliferation of broadband connectivity in Pakistan and meet capacity needs of future applications spurring the development of information and communications technology in Pakistan, it said.

It may be recalled here that SMW4 and I-ME-WE, two of the four undersea cables that connect Pakistan globally, were damaged earlier this year, slowing down the country’s internet connectivity by half. The new undersea cable consortium system will be an additional lifeline for the country’s internet connectivity in case of a similar damage in the future.

Presently, Transworld Associates (TWA) and PTCL act as the internet gateway to Pakistan and provide bandwidth to local internet service providers. Pakistan is connected with the cyber world through four undersea fiber optic cables: I-ME-WE, SMW3, SMW4 owned by PTCL and TWA-1, owned by Transworld.

Experiencing slower internet lately? You’re not alone: Several undersea cables have been cut in the wake of the recent typhoons in the region, leaving most ISPs in the country with slower connections.

Reports from several SouthEast Asian news sources have mentioned that the region’s Asia-American Gateway (AAG), TGA-Intra Asia (TGA-IA) and SEA-ME-WE3 (SMW3) cables all have suffered damages during the past weeks. AAG had been damaged as it was ruptured in two locations: 66 kilometers (41 miles) and 85 kilometers from its Hong Kong station. Meanwhile, TGA-IA cable’s damage was seen by experts at around 54 kilometers from the same island.

As such, all local ISPs and even those from other service providers in the SouthEast Asia have experienced slowdowns caused by the ruptures. Local internet service provider Cheetah Mobile who mainly services in the Rizal area has posted this message to their users, as captured by one of the redditors in r/Philippines.

> To all our Cheetah Broadband subscribers:  
> Due to the recent typhoons that hit Hong Kong, please be advised that the submarine fiber optic cable links of our international gateway were damaged. The slowdown in our Internet connection is not only being experienced by us but by all ISPs in the Philippines and this will only improve until the fiber cut is resolved. Multiple fault points have been detected and ALL our providers have initiated their repair process. Estimated repair time is dependent on the availability of submarine cable ships and weather conditions. To date, our providers have not given an exact lead time to complete the repair as they try their best to resolve the issue.

Converge has been constantly updating its subscribers with the developments on the undersea cable cuts:

_Update:_ Just right after we published this story, PLDT has also released a statement regarding the situation:

Globe Telecom has also issued their statement regarding the incident:

> Globe Telecom takes its internet routing responsibilities seriously, and over the years have invested significant amounts of capital in a variety of subsea cable systems, including the recent SEA-US system, to ensure diversity. Globe has successfully rerouted its data traffic that goes through the affected cable systems, to its other subsea cable capacity routes. In so doing, the multiple subsea cuts had no adverse impact to our enterprise clients and mobile and broadband customers.  
> Our technical teams are closely monitoring the network to ensure voice, SMS and data services are operating at normal levels.  
> – Yoly Crisanto, Senior Vice President for Corporate Communication, Globe Telecom

Repairs for the cables may take up mid-October, according to experts. The AAG is one of SouthEast Asia’s primary cables and connects the region to the mainland US via the Pacific Ocean via Guam, and Hawaii with a 20,000-kilometer undersea cable in which PLDT has also invested into. Several sites have offloaded IP routing into other servers to alleviate the situation.

According to the Vice Minister of Telecommunication, Boris Moreno, the government is unable to offer Cubans comprehensive Internet for their new PCs because the American embargo prevents it from getting service directly from the United States nearby through underwater cables. Instead, Cuba gets Internet service through less reliable satellite connections, usually from faraway countries including Italy and Canada.

Documents released by WikiLeaks reveal that Cuba and Venezuela signed a confidential contract in 2006 to lay an undersea fibre-optic cable that bypasses the United States. The cable is to be completed by 2010.

The contract between the two countries, which has been independently verified, adds weight to Cuban statements that the United States economic embargo of the island has forced it to rely on slow and expensive satellite links for Internet connectivity. Cuba is situated a mere 120 kilometres off the coast of Florida. The proposed 1,500 kilometre cable will connect Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti and Trinidad to the rest of the world via La Guaira, Venezuela.

Carrying out the work are CVG Telecom (Corporación Venezolana de Guyana) and ETC (Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba).

The leaked documents have technical details and pictures of the cable, maps, and systems to be used, parties signing the agreement, terms and conditions, costs, and a schedule of charges and compromises. The connection allows for the transmission of data, video and voice (VoIP). According to the contract, the agreement is designed to build a relationship of ""strategic value"" which will permit Cuba and Venezuela to, among other matters:

* Increase interchange between the two governments.  
* Foster science, cultural and social development.  
* Increase the volume and variety of relationships between country members of ALBA (Bolivarian Alternative for America) and the South American MERCOSUR trading block.  
* Help serve the increasing demand of commercial traffic between Cuba, Venezuela and the rest of the world.

The contract parties state that given the diversity of foreign affairs, they wish to build a new international order, multi-polar, based in sustainability, equity and common good and that an international cable with maximum security protected by international organizations (ITU/ICPC) is crucial.  

The documents disclose plans to separate commercial traffic and governmental traffic upon data arrival.","The article discusses the construction of an undersea cable between Cuba and Venezuela, which directly relates to the topic of cut sea cables.

The SEA-ME-WE 5 submarine cable is Bangladesh’s second submarine cable installed in Kuakata, and one of the largest suppliers of international bandwidth in the country.  
  
Mirza Kamal Ahmed, managing director of the Bangladesh Submarine Cables PLC (BSCPLC), said that the Bangladesh authorities were not aware as to when the problem could be fixed.  
  
‘The SEA-ME-WE 5 consortium is yet to identify the cause of the problem. Possibly, we think, any ship’s anchor may have hit the cable,’ he added.  
  
Multiple broadband internet users in Bangladesh said that they faced disturbance while browsing the internet as loading websites was taking too much time, and operating internet-based works was becoming impossible since midnight past Friday.  
  
International bandwidth usage in Bangladesh is around 5,200 Gbps and about 1,700 Gbps of that bandwidth is supplied by the SEA-ME-WE 5 submarine cable.  
  
The SEA-ME-WE 5 is a 20,000km submarine cable system connecting 17 countries through Points-of-Presence from Singapore to the Middle East to France and Italy in Western Europe.  
  
The cable of SEA-ME-WE 5 in the western side that connected Singapore got broken on Friday at 12:00am and all traffic between Kuakata-Singapore through the submarine cable is now shut down, according to BSCPLC’s press release issued on Saturday.  
  
The BSCPLC is shifting a substantial amount of the intercepted bandwidth to SEA-ME-WE 4 submarine cable, the press release said.","The article titled 'Internet users face trouble as submarine cable breaks down' discusses the breakdown of the SEA-ME-WE 5 submarine cable, which is a direct reference to cut sea cables.

It details the impact on internet services in Bangladesh, stating that the cable was broken, likely due to a ship's anchor hitting it.

The article provides specific information about the cable's significance to international bandwidth in Bangladesh and the ongoing issues faced by users due to this disruption.

Vậy cáp quang biển AAG là gì?

**Cáp quang biển AAG** là tuyến cáp quang truyền dữ liệu internet lớn nhất thế giới. Được thi công xong vào năm 2009, đây là tuyến cáp Châu Á Thái Bình Dương (AAG) với chiều dài tổng cộng hơn 20 nghìn km, tổng dung lượng dữ liệu thiết kế đạt 2 Terabit/giây và là tuyến cáp quang đặc biệt quan trọng kết nối Đông Nam Á với Mỹ. Tổng vốn đầu tư cho toàn tuyến cáp xấy xỉ 560 triệu USD.

### Cáp quang biển AAG là gì?

_Tuyến cáp quang AAG_ có các điểm cập bờ chính tại Mersing (Malaysia), Changi (Singapore), Sri Racha (Thái Lan), Tungku (Bruney), Vũng Tàu (Việt Nam), Currimao (Philippinnes), South Lantau (Hong Kong), Guam (Mỹ), Hawaii (Mỹ)...

Ở thời điểm hiện tại AAG là tuyến cáp quang đầu tiên và duy nhất kết nối dữ liệu internet trực tiếp từ khu vực Đông Nam Á đến Mỹ do vậy mà các sự cố đứt cáp liên quan đến tuyến này sẽ ảnh hưởng rất lớn đến việc truy cập internet từ các nước trong khu vực ra thế giới. lớn đến lưu lượng kết nối, trao đổi thông tin giữa các quốc gia khu vực này ra thế giới. Ngoài ra AAG còn có thể kết nối đến Australia, Ấn Độ, Châu Âu và châu Phi thông qua điểm cập bờ khác của hệ thống.

### Hàn nối cáp quang biển như thế nào?

Có thể mọi người hay nghĩ, để có thể hàn nối được cáp quang dưới đáy biển, các thợ lặn sẽ cùng trang thiết bị máy móc lặn xuống thực hiện công việc hàn nối. Thực tế lại khác, toàn bộ công việc hàn nối cáp quang biển được thực hiện trên các tàu chuyên dụng.

Các thợ lặn cũng không thể lặn xuống sâu dưới đáy biển do áp suất cực lớn, mà phải dùng máy móc và các thiết bị tời chuyên dụng để kéo cáp đứt từ đáy biển lên tàu, sau đó cố định 2 đầu cáp bằng hệ thống phao đặc biệt. Tiếp đó các kỹ sư sẽ sử dụng máy hàn cáp quang chuyên dụng để hàn từng sợi cáp nhỏ lại với nhau trong phòng kỹ thuật đặc biệt trên tàu.

Sau khi hoàn thành việc hàn nối các sợi cáp quang lại với nhau, bó cáp sẽ được gia cố, bọc bảo vệ như cũ và thả trở lại đáy biển. Quá trình rải cũng phải đòi hỏi phải có máy móc chuyên dụng để thổi cát dưới đáy biển, tạo thành rãnh để có thể đặt cáp quang vào và sau đó phủ lấp cát lại lên trên để giảm thiểu khả năng bị va chạm cũng như việc cắt chộm cáp hay cá mập cắn.","The article discusses the AAG submarine cable, its significance, and the implications of cable cuts on internet connectivity.

Fresh damage to undersea cables that supply African countries with the internet has raised new fears about the continent’s network vulnerabilities. The damage marks the third widespread disruption since the start of the year.

Internet users in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda reported different levels of disruption between Sunday and Monday following cuts to two submarine cables, EASSy (East Africa Submarine System) and Seacom. The breaks also caused disruptions in Mozambique, Malawi, and Madagascar, according to Cloudflare, a US internet data company.

Kenya’s communications authority said the process of recovery had begun, though “slow speeds may remain in the coming few days.” Telecom operator Safaricom said it would source “additional capacity with other undersea cable partners” to make up for the shortfall in connectivity. MTN and Telkom, two South African telecom majors operating in East Africa, said they were trying to “minimize” the disruption.

Tanzania has experienced the most severe outage, data from the Internet Outage Detection and Analysis project at the Georgia Institute of Technology shows. The US embassy in the country was closed to the public for two days until May 15 following the downtime, except for in cases of emergencies involving American citizens.

### Know More

The outage mirrors similar events in March, when cuts to four cables disrupted internet access in Nigeria, Ghana and other West African countries. For days, service providers only offered intermittent connection to users, stifling online banking activities, Ghana’s stock exchange, and other internet-based services.

Connectivity in East Africa was also limited in February when three submarine cables that run through the Red Sea were damaged. The International Cable Protection Committee, a group representing 98% of subsea cable operators, said the breaks were likely caused by the anchor of a cargo ship that was shot at by the Yemen-based Houthi rebel group. Those cables have not been repaired due to tensions over right of access to those waters.

Fixing the breaks on EASSy and Seacom may take several days to weeks, and may be “dependent on weather, sea conditions and the extent of the damage,” said Chris Wood, chief executive of the West Indian Ocean Cable Company, which helped Google to land a subsea cable in Africa. MainOne, an internet provider in West Africa, announced last week that its cables that were cut in March have now been repaired.

### Alexander’s view

Anxieties that have accompanied the three episodes of cable cuts in three months underscore Africa’s increased dependence on the internet for commerce and daily life.

Africa’s internet economy could reach $180 billion by 2025, according to estimates by Google and the World Bank’s private investment arm, the International Financial Corporation. That prospect should increase the sense of urgency among policymakers and service providers to build more resilience into the continent’s internet architecture.

Internet disruption in Africa tends to happen sub-regionally because cables run through multiple countries clustered together. “East Africa has one of the most advanced regional integration programs, perhaps only outdone by the Southern African Customs Union and the Francophone units,” said Bright Simons, research lead at IMANI Center for Policy and Education in Ghana.

“Yet, just like elsewhere, it has not been able to activate a regional framework for telecom emergencies like this, leaving operators to arrange ad hoc cross-border arrangements,” Simons said. Telecom regulatory authorities should work out “a contingency quasi-treaty” to coordinate faster responses during such emergencies, he said.

Africa has seen an increase in submarine cables over the past two decades, including Google’s 15,000-kilometer South Africa to Portugal Equiano cable, and the 45,000-kilometer 2Africa project owned by a consortium led by Meta. They have sometimes come under criticism for ulterior motives: Two Mozilla-affiliated researchers said the tech giants’ cable projects “are using colonialist tactics to exploit Africa on a massive scale,” despite claiming to bridge the digital gap. But more cables has meant more capacity for internet access on the continent.

Merely having new cables is not enough for expanding Africa’s access to the internet. Integrating them into other critical national infrastructure and ensuring interoperability within each region is the key to long-term resilience.

### Step Back

The West Africa Cable System, which serves Nigeria and its neighbors, reported two breaks in the first half of 2020, while the Africa Coast to Europe (ACE) line’s break in 2018 resulted in a total internet blackout in Mauritania for two days.

ACE was Mauritania’s sole submarine cable connection, but plans have since been launched for a second connection. The European Investment Bank is providing majority funding for a new €35 million cable.","The article titled 'East Africa outages stir fears over Africa’s internet vulnerabilities' discusses significant damage to undersea cables, specifically mentioning the EASSy and Seacom cables.

**Content:**  
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Two telecommunication companies in Haiti said their fiber optic cables were severed this week, temporarily leaving customers without service in what were suspected acts of sabotage by criminal gangs.
  
Digicel Haiti, one of Haiti’s biggest telecom companies, said one of its cables was cut on Thursday in the community of Martissant near the capital of Port-au-Prince, considered ground zero for warring gangs. The cable affects customers in Haiti’s western region, and it also had been severed earlier in the week.
  
Meanwhile, Access Haiti said some of its fiber optic cables were cut on Monday in what it described as an act of “sabotage.”
  
The two companies, when contacted by The Associated Press, declined to say how many of their customers were affected.

HGC Communications, a telecom operator in Hong Kong, reported yesterday that it was rerouting traffic, after the Seacom/TGN, AAE-1 and EIG cables were cut, estimating that 25% of traffic is disrupted.  
HGC’s measures include rerouting northbound traffic from Asia via China to Europe, routing through the US to Europe and diversifying its West bound traffic through the other 11 cables that run through the Red Sea.  
Seacom confirmed the damage to CNN, with chief digital officer Prenesh Padayachee saying repair works could take up to eight weeks to commence while permits from the Yemeni maritime authority are issued.  
Tata Communications said in a statement to _Capacity_ that it has been keeping a close watch on the situation and initiated immediate and appropriate remedial actions.  
“We invest in various cable consortiums to increase our diversity and hence in such situations of a cable cut or snag we are able to automatically reroute our services, thereby ensuring our customers have a stable, reliable and scalable connectivity,” Tata said.  
In response to the outages, Roderick Beck, global network capacity sourcing at United Cable Company said everyone is looking for wavelengths on the SMW5 cable that links Singapore to Marseille.  
“I am seeing tremendous demand for alternative subsea cable capacity from Marseille to Singapore,” he told _Capacity._  
“Within 24 hours of the Red Sea outages, almost two terabits of SMW5 capacity was reserved on two Asian carrier backbones,” he added.  
On the timeline for repairs Beck said:  
“There are reports that ships are on the way to repair the cables. Probably not true. First of all, you need an available ship and most are already at sea laying fibre optic or power cables.”  
“Secondly, a ship must return to the port where the spare fibre is stored and retrieve it. Every subsea cable has a storage depot where as much as 60 kilometers of spare fibre is kept for repairs, slack, and extensions.”  
“Then the repair ship must set sail, locate the point of damage, and fix it. In this case the repair ship must also arrange military escort as well and that is a low priority for the navies patrolling the Red Sea.”  
AAE-1 is a 25,000km consortium cable system connecting South East Asia to Europe via Egypt, with nineteen operators as members, including TeleYemen.  
The EIG (Europe India Gateway) cable connects the UK to India, via Mediterranean Europe, and is owned by sixteen operators.  
Speculation is rife that the Rubymar cargo ship, a UK vessel struck by a Houthi rebel missile is responsible for the damage.  
“Since the Rubymar went to its watery grave early Saturday morning local time, I suspect the immediate threat of more outages has passed,” Beck said.  
The Yemen-based and Iranian-backed Houthi’s have been targeting ships in response to the Israeli offensive against Palestine.  
Industry sources are reporting that the ships anchor could have been dragging across the seabed before it sunk on Saturday, damaging cables in the process.  
Last week, Yemen’s government said it was keen to ensure that telecom cables were not damaged and would provide facilities for damaged cables to be repaired and maintained.","The article discusses the cutting of undersea cables, specifically the Seacom/TGN, AAE-1, and EIG cables, and its impact on telecommunications traffic.

##### In Cuba, mystery shrouds fate of Internet cable

HAVANA (AP) — It was all sunshine, smiles and celebratory speeches as officials marked the arrival of an undersea fiber-optic cable they promised would end Cuba’s Internet isolation and boost web capacity 3,000-fold. Even a retired Fidel Castro had hailed the dawn of a new cyber-age on the island.

More than a year after the February 2011 ceremony on Siboney Beach in eastern Cuba, and 10 months after the system was supposed to have gone online, the government never mentions the cable anymore, and Internet here remains the slowest in the hemisphere. People talk quietly about embezzlement torpedoing the project and the arrest of more than a half-dozen senior telecom officials.

Perhaps most maddening, nobody has explained what happened to the much-ballyhooed $70 million project.

“They did some photo-op … and then that scandal came out, and then it just disappeared from human consciousness,” said Larry Press, a professor of information systems at California State University, Dominguez Hills, who studies Cuba, referring to foreign media reports and whispers by diplomats that several executives at state phone company Etecsa and the two senior officials in the Telecommunications Ministry were arrested last year.

The cable was strung from Venezuela with the help of key ally Hugo Chavez. Government officials said from the start that the bandwidth boon would be prioritized for hospitals, universities and other usage deemed in service of the common good; the legions of Cubans with little or no access to the Internet from their homes would have to wait.

But a dozen employees of public institutions interviewed by The Associated Press said they have seen no noticeable improvement in their work connections. If anything, they say, download speeds have even gotten a little slower.

Going online in Cuba will try the patience of anyone who’s ever had a taste of high-speed DSL connections.","The article discusses an undersea fiber-optic cable from Venezuela intended to improve internet access in Cuba, directly mentioning 'undersea cable' and detailing the implications of its failure to provide the promised connectivity.

According to a statement from Bangladesh Submarine Cables PLC (BSCPLC) – which is a stakeholder in SEA-ME-WE 5 – the break occurred 440 km from the Singapore end of the cable just after midnight on April 20. Consequently, all traffic between Singapore and SEA-ME-WE 5’s landing station in Kuakata is down.

BSCPLC said that international internet traffic has been rerouted onto SEA-ME-WE 4, which is the only other international subsea cable with a landing point in Bangladesh (in Cox's Bazar, rather than Kuakata).

However, the loss of SEA-ME-WE 5 means Bangladesh has lost close to 1.7 Tbps of international capacity – compared to around 800 Gbps on SEA-ME-WE 4 – which is impacting internet speeds across the country, BSCPLC said.

According to the Daily Star, Bangladesh is still able to access about 100 Gbps of capacity from the west side of SEA-ME-WE 5 that runs to France. It also has another 2.7 Tbps of terrestrial capacity via international terrestrial cable (ITC) licence holders that import bandwidth from India.

The 20,000-km SEA-ME-WE 5 cable connects 17 countries between Singapore and France. Between Singapore and Bangladesh, the cable also has landing points in Malaysia, Indonesia and Myanmar. No reports of internet disruptions have been reported from those countries at press time. However, each of those countries have multiple international subsea cables to fall back on.

The SEA-ME-WE 6 cable – in which BSCPLC is also a stakeholder, and which will land in Cox’s Bazar – is scheduled to be ready for service in 2025.

BSCPLC said repair work has been initiated, but it would take “two or three days” to repair. Various local media reports have claimed it may take until at least Wednesday for repairs to be completed.

The cause of the break has not yet been revealed. Ironically, BSCPLC had announced last Thursday that maintenance work was scheduled to be performed on SEA-ME-WE 5 between 3am and 4am on Friday morning, which would cause “partial interruptions” in internet services during that time. It’s unclear if the maintenance work is related to the cable break.","The article discusses the damage to the SEA-ME-WE 5 submarine cable, which caused significant disruption to internet services in Bangladesh.

The cable was laid by the French company Alcatel-Lucent.

For days, and though the Cuban government hasn’t commented on the matter, word on the street has it that the fiber optic cable linking the towns of La Guaira (Venezuela) and Siboney (Cuba) doesn’t exist.

That’s right, it’s turned out that the most anxiously awaited cable in the history of Cuba “died before being born.” According to these rumors in the street, it was eaten by “sharks.”

They say it was due to poor quality materials, which simplified the tasks of the insatiable barracudas in the Caribbean.

According to that “hearsay,” this occurred even though the cable was expressly purchased by high-level executive administrators of the Ministry of Communications.

Yet this must have some truth, given the arrests and subsequent imprisonment of two deputies engaged in “performing other important tasks” for that agency’s then minister, Ramiro Valdes.

This all takes me back to my childhood days, when my elementary schoolteacher told me about some “very bad ministers” during the pre-revolutionary years of the Republic. They stole everything, including funds for children’s school breakfasts.

In my infantile innocence, those men were the bad guys,” but they were also long-gone characters, despised to the point that they would never again gain a foothold in our country.

The truth is that today, at least in in my opinion, the real sharks that “ate the cable” live far from the depths of the Caribbean. Their habitat is located inside air-conditioned luxury cars, or beside the pools at “their homes,” with lobster and shrimp dishes, each of them with a glass of whiskey on one side and a pretty woman on the other.

The “sharks” that feasted on the $70 million cable that stretches between La Guaira and Siboney await cautiously for the “day after,” that’s why today they “stretch and stretch” the stitched-up guise of “comrade” for when the time comes, fully take advantage, this time of without restrictions of movement.

What’s more, they say that one of them likes to compare the Internet with “a wild horse yet to be tamed.” Perhaps behind this smile is concealed the real reason why he made sure the much-desired cable would never reach us. At least for now, the new era will not come at the galloping speed of such untamable stallions.","The article discusses a fiber optic cable intended to connect Cuba and Venezuela, describing its failure and the implications of that failure, including the metaphorical notion of it being 'eaten by sharks.'

"Cuba's Internet Connectivity Challenges Amid Undersea Cable Limitations","Only 16% of Cubans online due to U.S. trade embargo limiting access to undersea cables; reliance on expensive satellite service highlighted.","https://phys.org/news/2011-07-cuba-percent-online-capacity.html","2011-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","By ANDREA RODRIGUEZ, Associated Press",Yes,"Andrea Rodriguez","Douglas, Isle of Man","5000","2011-07-08","English","Phys.org","(AP) -- About 16 percent of Cubans are online in some capacity with access to email, the island's intranet or the worldwide Web, a government agency says.

Cuba's National Statistics Office said in a report posted online this week that nearly 1.8 million of the country's 11.2 million residents used some kind of ""Internet service"" in 2010, a 12 percent increase from 1.6 million the previous year.

The report shows a generally steady increase since 2005.

The U.S. trade embargo has long kept Cuba from connecting to nearby undersea fiber-optic cables, forcing the island to rely on slow, expensive satellite service.

Cuba currently has the second-worst connectivity rates on the planet, according to a report by Akamai Technologies Inc. But a $70 million undersea cable laid with Venezuelan help arrived this year and could come online as early as this month.

The new usage figure is separate from a survey last year by the same office that found only 2.9 percent of Cubans reported having access to the Internet, mostly through schools and workplaces.

The previous survey likely suffered from underreporting of access to black market dial-up accounts. It also was apparently more narrowly focused on direct access to the Web.

The island's intranet is a limited but more widely available online service in which people can surf local sites and open email accounts to send and receive correspondence, including to and from other countries.

Outside experts put the real number of Cubans with access to the larger worldwide Web at about 5 percent to 10 percent.

Cuba treats its limited bandwidth as a precious resource and gives priority to usage deemed to have social merit, such as at universities. Scarce home dial-up accounts are expensive and not available to most Cubans.

The Statistics Office's new report also cited a boom in cellphone usage since President Raul Castro loosened restrictions in 2008. While mobile users numbered just 200,000 in 2007, just over 1 million were registered by last year, it said.

According to HGC Global Communications, the damage has disrupted around a quarter of data traffic travelling through the volatile region.

This week, official statements from Hong Kong-based HGC Global Communications have confirmed that three submarine cable systems – the Asia-Africa-Europe 1, the Europe India Gateway, and the Seacom-TGN-Gulf systems – have been severed in the Red Sea.

The cables carry large volumes of data traffic from Asia to Europe, much of which is currently being rerouted over 11 neighbouring submarine systems.

According to HGC, the damage impacts roughly 25% of data traffic passing through the Red Sea.

Processes related to repairing the cables are reportedly already underway, though these are likely to take a number of weeks, particularly given the ongoing conflict in the local area.

Exactly what has caused the damage to the cables has yet to be revealed – indeed, it is hard to ascertain the causes of cable damage before the cables have been dredged up for repairs – though there are fears that it could deliberate sabotage by the Houthi rebels currently attacking Western shipping operations nearby.

At the end of last year, Houthi-linked media published a map showing the local submarine cable systems, along with ambiguous messaging that could hint at the infrastructure being a potential target for attack.

However, the Houthi rebels deny sabotaging the cables, instead blaming the increased Western naval presence for the disruption.

“The hostilities on Yemen by the British and U.S. naval military units caused a disruption in the submarine cables in the Red Sea, which jeopardized the security and safety of international communications and the normal flow of information,” said a statement from Yemen’s Transportation Ministry, which is currently under Houthi control.

Submarine cables being severed is, in fact, a fairly common occurrence, with cables typically being damaged by becoming entangled in trawling nets or on a ship's anchor.

Deliberate attacks on submarine infrastructure are incredibly rare, requiring both knowledge of the cable’s precise location as well as the case to disrupt the cables sometimes hundreds of metres beneath the surface.

While the submarine cables near Yemen’s coastline are, in places, only around 100 metres deep, the chances of them being specifically targeted by the rebels seems slim, particularly given the local military presence throughout the area.

On Sunday, May 12, two submarine cables (Seacom and EASSy) suffered breaks along a stretch of coastline between the cable landing stations in Mtunzini, South Africa and Maputo, Mozambique. It was the latest in a historically bad run of submarine cable failures that have led to disruptions of internet service around the continent of Africa.

""Keen observer of the submarine cable industry"" and friend of the blog, Philippe Devaux, created this markup of a Telegeography map depicting the location of the cable cuts.

Impacts were observed from Kenya down the east coast of Africa to South Africa beginning just before 07:30 UTC (10:30 am East Africa time). Among the East African countries impacted, Tanzania experienced the most severe disruption, according to Kentik’s aggregate NetFlow.

In February, multiple submarine cables connecting Europe and Asia were cut in an incident in the Red Sea on February 24. Having been attacked by Houthis from Yemen, the CS Rubymar was abandoned and left to drift at sea. Ultimately, its anchor snagged and cut three cables in the sea inlet’s shallow waters. I published my analysis as part of an investigation led by WIRED magazine to dig into the incident.

Finally on March 14, four submarine cables (ACE, MainOne, WACS, and SAT-3) suffered failures off the coast of Côte d’Ivoire over a period of 5.5 hours. The suspected cause was an undersea landslide in the Trou sans Fond (“bottomless pit”) in an undersea canyon running from the coast. The last of the repairs was finally completed on May 10.

Impacts of the March 14 cable cuts on internet traffic to Nigeria

Vodacom Tanzania was one of the most impacted providers in East Africa. On May 15, they announced a full restoration of services, but BGP data reveals the scramble to re-establish connectivity immediately following the loss of the submarine cables on the 12th.

While some Vodacom Tanzania routes were simply withdrawn at the time of the cable outages, others were rerouted over Tigo in an attempt to attain transit from Djibouti Telecom to the north. Vodacom Tanzania was primarily using Seacom’s IP transit service, which relies on its eponymous subsea cable, as well as transit from the parent company’s network in South Africa.

Eventually, Tanzanian providers were able to reroute traffic over alternative cables until the cable repairs take place.

Conversely, Safaricom of Kenya was largely able to weather the loss of the cables by reverting to other sources of transit.

The BGP analysis shows instability of WIOCC transit beginning around 07:28 UTC on May 12, until its complete loss over an hour later. From a BGP perspective, the loss was replaced by transit from China Telecom Global, as depicted in this BGP visualization of a Safaricom route.

As with previous submarine cable disruptions, the latest cable cuts affected connectivity between public cloud regions. Kentik’s multi-cloud performance capability captured the impact.

The most visible impact, illustrated in the screen captures below, were measurements between cloud regions in South Africa and Asia. Latencies were observed to increase dramatically as traffic was redirected along longer geographic paths due to the loss of these cables.

In the past decade, the number of submarine cables serving the continent of Africa has nearly doubled, leading many internet infrastructure observers to believe that this abundance of cables contributed to a greater degree of resilience.

However, in the past nine months, Africa has endured four separate cable incidents, each resulting in the failures of multiple submarine cables. This leads to some tough questions. Are environmental conditions contributing to greater underwater turbidity that could lead to more undersea landslides? Has increased commerce led to greater maritime traffic and, thus, a greater threat from ship anchors?

We have done a lot in the past decade to keep local internet traffic local by encouraging domestic interconnectivity through internet exchanges, for example. For the primary hubs of Africa, the amount of content that is served through local caches is enormous compared to where we were a decade ago, but it doesn’t appear to be enough. We still have a high degree of internet connectivity dependent on submarine cables despite the fact that much content now gets served locally in many of these markets.

We’ll need to learn what was the cause of this latest incident. While we are waiting, it is worth considering that WIOCC’s EASSy cable and the Seacom cable failed within minutes of each other — similar to the cable cuts in the Red Sea, which were caused by a ship anchor. The cable failures caused by undersea landslides were spread out over multiple hours.

According to a recent LinkedIn post from Devaux, the cable repair ship Leon Thevenin has been dispatched from Cape Town, South Africa, to make the necessary repairs.

Hopefully these are the last submarine cable breaks to disrupt African connectivity for a very long time.

They have said they are working to fix it.

The patchy service was a result of faults in the under-sea cables that connect the region to the rest of the world through South Africa, industry expert Ben Roberts told the BBC.

A similar outage was experienced in parts of West and Southern Africa in March.

Cloudflare Radar, which monitors internet connectivity, said that Tanzania was of the worst-affected countries with traffic falling to 30% of expected levels.

Tanzania's Citizen newspaper described what has happened as an ""internet blackout \[that\] has affected major network channels"".

On X, formerly known as Twitter, service providers have been fielding queries from frustrated customers.

In response to one Kenyan user who wanted to know if they would be able to watch the Manchester United versus Arsenal English Premier League match, Airtel Kenya said its team was working on the ""network issue"" and apologised.

Safaricom, also in Kenya, said it was ""experiencing a challenge"".

Airtel Uganda has said it was aware of the ""intermittent internet service"". And MTN Rwanda said there was ""an issue of degradation of international links"".

Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar have also been affected according to Cloudflare Radar.

Mr Roberts, from the pan-Africa company Liquid Intelligent Technologies, said that he had confirmed that one cable that runs alongside the coast of East Africa, known as Eassy, had been cut earlier on Sunday some 45km (28 miles) north of the South African port city of Durban.

Another cable was also cut. He ruled out the idea that it could be sabotage and said it was rather an unhappy coincidence.

Other cables linking East Africa to Europe are also available and gradually the service should improve as data is re-routed. But as a lot of big companies have data centres in South Africa the damage to the vital link that Eassy provides had a big impact.

In March, widespread outages were reported in countries including South Africa, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Benin, Ghana and Burkina Faso. This was also put down to cable failures. The cause was not clear but led to the frustration of millions of customers around the continent.","The article discusses significant internet outages in East Africa due to faults in undersea cables, specifically mentioning that the Eassy cable was cut, which had a major impact on connectivity.

Vietnam's major telecommunications companies said they are investing in new Internet cables to ease their dependence on the undersea cable AAG, which has continuously ruptured since 2011.  

Lam Quoc Cuong, representative of Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications (VNPT), told news website Zing on Friday that a new undersea cable with a speed of 54 tetrabytes per second will go live next year.  

It will be a lot faster than the 2.88 Tb/s speed of the AAG, or Asia America Gateway, which links Vietnam and the US, he said.  

At a length of 10,400 kilometers, the new cable, known as the Asia Pacific Gateway, will connect the central city of Da Nang with Singapore, Malaysia and Japan.  

VNPT and military-owned Viettel are among the main investors of the cable, besides Japan's NTT Docomo, China Telecom and China Unicom, according to Cuong.  

Pham Dinh Truong of Viettel was quoted as saying that his company has also invested in a 25,000-kilometer cable connecting Vietnam with Europe. The Asia Africa Euro 1 is too scheduled to go into operation next year.  

The Ministry of Information and Communication recently announced that Vietnam will also build a land cable to China, the news website reported.  

Since 2011, the 20,000-kilometer AAG, which is used by major Internet providers VNPT, FPT Telecom, Viettel and SPT, has broken or been shut down for maintenance on several occasions.  

This year alone it has snapped three times.  

Its latest rupture took place on April 23, and even though it was supposedly fixed on May 15, local connection has not fully recovered yet.  

As a result, the cable's management company early this week announced that the AAG will have a 10-day maintenance starting this Sunday.  

During the period the connection might be shaky or totally lost, according to Viettel.  

However, representatives of local telecommunications promised to employ back-up cables to minimize the problem.","The article discusses the investment in new undersea cables in Vietnam, specifically in response to the ongoing issues with the Asia America Gateway (AAG) cable, which has experienced multiple ruptures.

HAVANA TIMES – An agreement signed between Cuba and French company Orange LLC. to install a submarine communications cable between Cuba and Martinique became public news on December 7, 2022.

Seven days before, the United States Department of Justice had made a recommendation to the Federal Communications Commission to reject the authorization request made by the companies ARCOS-1 USA Inc. and SurNet Inc., since 2018, to connect a fiber optic cable between the US and Cuba.

The international Arimao submarine cable, which began to be installed at the Tricontinental Port in Cienfuegos, touched land in Martinique in the French overseas Department on January 10, 2023, according to ETECSA. A branch of the Orange Group, called Orange Marine, is responsible for the technical work.

The Cuban telecommunications company also announced that the possibility of “expanding and diversifying international capacity in the face of growing demand for Internet and broadband services,” are some of the benefits of installing the second fiber optic cable to the island, which joins the cable that already exists between Cuba and Venezuela (which takes its name from the abbreviation of Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America, ALBA-1).

Commercial relations between ETECSA and Orange LLC. come at a time when Cubans are complaining about constant Internet cuts and a slower connection than normal. However, statements from officials and brief posts on social media don’t explain what improvements will come with the new fiber optic cable. Nor have they offered details about work plans agreed with Orange LLC. The start date of the services of this cable contradict one another.

**What do we know about fiber optic cables in Cuba?**

Almost 99% of total Internet traffic comes from undersea cables, the real “backbone” of global telecommunications. While Cuba is located in one of the areas with the highest density of submarine fiber optic cables, it has problems accessing the Internet, as most of its connections come via satellites. This leads to Internet access being a lot more expensive and slow. Thus, news of the agreement with Orange is extremely important.

Looking at the map of undersea cables, you can see that four fiber optic cables are currently touching Cuban soil: Arimao (which connects the island to Martinique), ALBA-1, and another two that belong to the US Government and connect the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base with Florida (GTMO-1) and Puerto Rico (GTMO PR).

However, ALBA-1, the first fiber optic cable that connected Cuba to Venezuela and Jamaica, is the only one that offers Internet services to Cubans.

In 2007, Cuba and Venezuela announced they would install a submarine cable which would be able to multiply the data transmission, including pictures and voice messages, that come and leave from Cuba, according to its technical description.

Telecomunicaciones Gran Caribe led the project, a mixed Cuban-Venezuelan company, that belongs to both countries’ state-led telecommunications companies. Preparatory work began in 2009 and the installation of 1630 km of cable began in January 2011. It touched soil in Santiago de Cuba a month later, according to state-controlled media.

Gran Caribe had announced that the submarine cable would begin operations at the beginning of the second semester of 2011; but it wasn’t until January 2013 that ETECSA released a statement that the system had been operating since August 2012.

The news stifled any hope Cubans had about improved or greater Internet access across the country. “A submarine cable working doesn’t automatically mean that there are greater possibilities to access the Internet,” the Cuban company pointed out.

In a Twitter thread about the start of installation works of the Arimao cable, users were skeptical of the project being a solution to Internet connection problems in Cuba.

**How long has the Arimao project been in the works?**

A file from Martinique authorities points out Orange LLC., represented by Carine ROMANETTI, head of the “Strategy, Network and Submarine Systems” department of the European entity, filed a request for the submarine telecommunications cable that would connect Cuba to Martinique, on November 15, 2021. Installation and Operation permits weren’t approved until April 2022.

The report also points out that the project, spanning 2470 kms, “lands in the Schoelcher municipality, on Madiana beach (…), and connects to the land network installed in 2018, to accommodate the Kanawa telecommunications cable (owned by Orange), coming from French Guiana. The total cost of the works would be 1,200,343 EUR, including tax, the report stated.

During the start of works to deploy the system in Cuba, Jean Luc Vuillemin, president of Orange’s International Networks, said that a station had been built in parallel to house technical services, in line with global trends. This is one of the very few technical details we have about the cable up until now.

Statements from ETECSA’s executive director about the project only refer to the possible diversification of international connections and growing services, as it has a greater capacity than the international ALBA-1 connection. However, she explains that this will only happen when the island’s economic situation allows for it.

Nor is it clear when the cable will begin to operate. In this regard, _Granma_ newspaper published that it would be up and running in the second semester of this year, while Cubadebate and National TV are talking about April.

Expectations have grown with the arrival of this new chance to increase connectivity; but it seems that it will still be a while before Cubans are able to enjoy quality cellphone and Internet services without coverage problems. This doesn’t all depend on just one submarine cable though.

**What are Cuba’s Internet connection problems?**

Some Internet access problems in Cuba go beyond those linked satellite and submarine cable connections. Complaints about the quality and stability of this service is repeated on social media, while official organizations propose half-cooked solutions.

Statistics tell us that over 6.7 million Cubans connect to the Internet using mobile data; the number of users grew by over a million in 2022 alone. This increased volume of traffic is reflected in a user’s average monthly consumption over the past year, which went up by over 1.5 gigabytes per subscriber. The consequences? Network congestion, triggered by insufficient wireless providers and the absence of new technologies and devices.

With ALBA-1’s capacity to the max and wireless connections that haven’t been installed in homes, national demand isn’t being satisfied today, Tania Velazquez Rodrigue, ETECSA’s president, said. She also recognized that there are bottlenecks in international calls.

Before ETECSA’s executive director gave a statement to state-controlled media, Ricardo Serrano, the company’s provincial director in Santiago de Cuba, told local TV channel _Tele Turquino_ that there are other reasons for poor quality Internet connections.

On the program _Santiago Hoy_, issued on August 24, 2022, Serrano explained that radio bases are affected by blackouts, as they have backup power with batteries that can keep them working for approximately three hours.

It wasn’t until late January that Velazquez Rodriguez admitted that only 25% of the over 5000 radio bases installed in the country have backup power. He also explained that the country didn’t purchase all of the devices because units were so expensive (30,000 USD).

Ricardo Serrano pointed out that another reason for Internet connection problems has to do with the use of 4G (fourth generation of broadband) in Cuba, creating problems with voice transmission. “4G is a network to access the Internet, and people are using it to talk; you have 2G and 3G to talk,” Serrano clarified.

The executive pretends he doesn’t know about VoLTE technology that allows you to make calls using 4G and instead blames users for using it wrong. His explanation shows how a smartphone that works with 4G changes the network to 3G or 2G when it makes or receives a call.

This situation has two outcomes: poor audio quality, and problems navigating the Internet during a phone call. Lots of the time, the device stays connected to the slowest network. People recommend activating and deactivating “airplane mode” to connect the cellphone again. However, this strategy isn’t always an effective solution.

Velazquez also gave a statement about reusing the frequency spectrum, which is key with cellphones. It has to do with the “channels” the signal travels through to reach smartphones and allows you to make calls or connect to the Internet.

2G and 3G in Cuba use a bandwidth of 900 MHz. While 4G networks using a bandwidth of 1800 MHz will also be used by 900 MHz.

The technical definitions indicate that while the frequency is lower (700 or 800 MHz), they can travel longer distances without losing intensity and can penetrate closed spaces better. On the other hand, higher frequencies (2100 or 2600 MHz) have a greater bandwidth, but they reach shorter distances and are weaker. This is why the world opts for lower frequencies for more modern technologies.

So, how effective will one of ETECSA’s options be to revert the saturated network if it starts using new frequencies, such as 2100 MHz (which is much higher than the frequencies used today)?

In Cuba, 4G could operate at a bandwidth of 700 MHz, which is extremely attractive, because it allows for greater coverage with less infrastructure. But the issue here is that this is the bandwidth used for analog TVs and the process of partially transitioning to digital TV is going very slowly. Enabling the 700 MHz frequency for mobile networks is only being worked on slowly.","The article ""Internet in Cuba and the New Fiber Optic Cable"" discusses submarine cables, specifically the Arimao cable connecting Cuba to Martinique and the ALBA-1 cable connecting Cuba to Venezuela.

ISLAMABAD/KARACHI: A fault in the India-Middle East-Western Europe (IMEWE) submarine cable caused consumers and businesses across Pakistan major internet disruptions, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) said on Saturday, adding that customers may experience slow browsing speed.

However, many people complained that they had no internet service at all.

“The Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) has set up alternate routes to get the internet back up. The international team is dealing with the IMEWE and it will take a few days to sort out,” said PTCL spokesperson Imran Janjua.

“At the moment, there are two submarine cables which are down — there was a similar issue in July this year and it is still being repaired,” he added.

> PTA says traffic being rerouted through alternative routes; tech industry at a virtual standstill

The PTA and PTCL did not confirm how long it would take to restore internet services in the country.

The IMEWE submarine cable is an ultra-high capacity fibre optic undersea cable system which links India and Europe via the Middle East. The 12,091km-long cable has nine terminal stations, operated by leading telecom carriers from eight countries.

“One of the PTCL cables has been cut near Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Currently, internet services are affected. However, PTCL is in process [of shifting] its traffic on alternate routes/cables and services will be better soon,” said PTA spokesperson Khurram Mehran.

Khalid Bajwa of Patari, the country’s largest Pakistani music streaming platform, said that they had content scheduled to go up on social media on Saturday.

“Everything has stopped. There were a couple of videos which had to go to a brand for approval but nothing has happened. We upload around three to four videos everyday and have been trying to do so since morning but no luck,” he told Dawn.

WonderTree, a start-up run by Mohammad Waqas, also faced similar issues.

“We are a technology start-up and we have not been able to do anything from morning to evening,” he said.

“We had a lot of deadlines for Saturday, as it is the weekend and we needed to wind up a lot of things. Online banking was not available either, so we could not make payments. We just weren’t able to function,” he added.

Akash Sheikh of Nest IO — a technology incubator — said: “It is of great concern that our internet connectivity nationwide has been affected. A strong internet link is essential for productivity and critical to our infrastructure.”

Naseer Akhtar, chairman of the Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA), explained that such accidents happened all over the world, but stressed the necessity to invest in alternative routes for internet traffic, so businesses and people don’t suffer. “We’re lucky it happened over the weekend and not during a busy week,” he said.

According to Mustafa Butt, an information technology entrepreneur, activities came to a halt at work throughout the day. “Luckily it is a holiday and there is not much of a work load,” he added.

Mohammad Faisal, another IT entrepreneur, said that his entire day had been wasted. “Whatever little progress could be made was through mobile data. Most companies in the IT sector cannot afford the slightest disruption in internet service,” said the entrepreneur.

The outage also impacted mobile networks and internet service providers. Although Nayatel messaged its subscribers that its links would up by evening, browsing remained slow. PTCL subscribers struggled with browsing till late Saturday evening.

Wi-Tribe sent a message out to its customers explaining that “you might experience slow speed issue today due to a severe bandwidth degradation affecting all the internet service providers in Pakistan.”

Internet services were also disrupted in July, when a similar fault with one of the PTCL submarine cables created an outage. It took several hours before the internet traffic — both incoming and outgoing — were routed through an alternative cable.

Country will be able to weather undersea cable breakdowns in future.

Spread across 20,000 kilometers, the new cable system will connect Singapore to Europe (Italy and France) and traverse Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Oman, UAE, Yemen, Djibouti and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, according to TWA. DESIGN: OMER ASIM

**KARACHI:** In a move that will strengthen the country’s internet backbone connectivity, Transworld Associates (Private) Limited (TWA) has joined a consortium of leading telecom companies to build and operate the South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe (SEA-ME-WE)-5 submarine cable network.

TWA will own the Pakistan landing of SEA-ME-WE-5, which will be ready for service by mid-2016, the company said in a statement last week.

“It’s a good development and will improve our strategic positioning in the world of IT and telecommunications,” Wahajus Siraj of the Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan (Ispak) told _The Express Tribune_.

“The new submarine cable will provide more resilience to Pakistan’s internet backbone connectivity,” Siraj said.

Pakistan is connected with the cyber world through four undersea fibre optic cables. These include India-Middle East-Western Europe (I-ME-WE), SEA-ME-WE-3 and SEA-ME-WE-4, which are owned by Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) and TWA-1, which is owned by TWA. The new fibre optic will be the fifth undersea cable to connect Pakistan with the rest of the world.

TWA and PTCL act as the internet gateway to Pakistan and provide bandwidth to local internet service providers.

The new submarine cable will deliver ultra-broadband capacity and faster access to consumers and businesses. Its ultimate design capacity of 24 terabit per second will be used to serve the countries along its route, TWA said.

Once operational, the cable will provide the country with an additional capacity in case of breakdown in any of the existing cables, something that happened in 2013.

In March 2013, internet speed across Pakistan plummeted nearly 60% when SEA-ME-WE-4 was damaged in the Arabian Sea near Karachi and that, too, only two weeks after I-ME-WE fibre optic cable was broken down. These back-to-back breakdowns left the entire internet traffic on the remaining two cables – SEA-ME-WE-3 and TW1, causing congestion.

With two of the four undersea cables that connect Pakistan with the internet out of service, the country faced a massive reduction in internet speed. Shortly after the disruption, internet users faced a host of problems ranging from intermittent to slow connectivity. Many had complained about a significant decrease in their browsing speed.

**Better-equipped**  
With the addition of SEA-ME-WE-5, the country will be better equipped to deal with similar breakdowns in the future, according to experts. The new cable will come with approximately six times Pakistan’s current capacity, says IT and telecom blog, Propakistani.pk.

Moreover, the undersea cable will also benefit retailers, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), by offering an alternative to the market leader PTCL. “It [SEA-ME-WE-5] also provides an alternative route to the operators by balancing out PTCL’s dominance in the market,” Siraj said.

Spread across 20,000 kilometres, the new cable system will connect Singapore to Europe (Italy and France) and traverse Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Oman, UAE, Yemen, Djibouti and Saudi Arabia, according to TWA.

“We will be able to deliver resilient and redundant network solutions with several advantages, such as flexibility and reliability for our customers as the system will offer an increased service experience,” TWA President Kamran Malik said.

Appreciating Islamabad’s pro-investment programmes and policies for the ICT sector, Malik said, “This investment by TWA is a result of positive and goal-oriented policies, which will enhance socio-economic development and spur economic growth via a more connected Pakistan.”

"Internet Outage Affects Multiple African Countries Due to Undersea Cable Failures","Significant internet disruptions reported in over a dozen African countries following failures of key undersea cables, including the West Africa Cable System.","https://apnews.com/article/africa-internet-outage-undersea-cables-failure-ac67fd11b4d9ae7cb3959622c5e9e78b","2024-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","By CHINEDU ASADU",Yes,"Chinedu Asadu","New York, USA","6925","2024-03-14","English","AP News","ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — A dozen countries across Africa suffered a major internet outage on Thursday as multiple undersea telecommunication cables reported failures, network operators and internet watch groups said.

The MTN Group, one of Africa’s largest network providers, said the ongoing disruptions were a result of failures in multiple major undersea cables. “Our operations are actively working to reroute traffic through alternative network paths,” the South African company said in a statement.

Network disruptions caused by cable damage have occurred in Africa in recent years. However, “today’s disruption points to something larger (and) this is amongst the most severe,” said Isik Mater, director of research at NetBlocks, a group that documents internet disruptions around the world.

NetBlocks said data transmission and measurement shows a major disruption to international transits, “likely at or near the subsea network cable landing points.”

The cause of the failure was not immediately clear.

There were fears of disruption of essential services in worst-hit countries like Ivory Coast where the disruption was severe. Africa leads mobile device web traffic in the world, with many of the continent’s businesses relying on the internet to deliver services to their customers.

The West Africa Cable System (WACS), the Africa Coast to Europe (ACE), SAT-3 and MainOne were among the system cables that observers said were affected in Thursday’s outage.

Internet analysis firm Cloudflare reported a pattern in the timing of the disruptions that heavily impacted at least 10 countries in West Africa, including Ivory Coast, Liberia, Benin, Ghana, and Burkina Faso.

Vodacom, South Africa’s mobile operator, also reported “intermittent connectivity issues due to multiple undersea cable failures.” Namibia and Lesotho were also affected.

The impact from such cable failures worsens as networks attempt to route around the damage, potentially reducing the capacity available to other countries, said Mater with NetBlocks.

“The initial disruption may be a physical cut, but subsequent issues could be of a technical nature,” said Mater.","The article titled 'Internet outage hits several African countries as undersea cables fail' discusses multiple failures of undersea telecommunication cables leading to significant internet outages across a dozen African countries.

It directly mentions 'undersea cables' and provides details about specific cables affected, including the West Africa Cable System and others.

"Tiny British Island Struggles for Undersea Fiber Connection","£10M funding plea for undersea fiber cable to restore internet connectivity for St Helena, impacting local development.","https://www.theregister.com/2013/01/03/st_helena_fibre","2013-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","Bill Ray",Yes,"Bill Ray","San Francisco, California, USA (HQ)
London, UK
Singapore","7000","2013-01-03","English","The Register","Days after walking away from the ITU treaty on global communications, which asked nations to connect up their islands, the UK confirmed it will not readily stump up the cash to do just that.

The island in question is St Helena, a British territory smack bang in the middle of the South Atlantic Ocean. Its inhabitants need £10m to hook into some nearby undersea fibre after persuading the cable's operator to swing the transatlantic connection closer to the isle. The islanders appealed to Blighty's Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) to ask the government to consider adopting the ITU's resolution on improving islands' net connections regardless of the outcome of the treaty negotiations.

But the UK is already committed to building a runway on St Helena for £250m and spends £20m annually keeping the place solvent. The thought of handing over an eight-figure sum for an optic fibre cable did not impress* the FCO.

""The UK did not sign the revised International Telecommunication Regulations last week in Dubai, and has no intention of doing so in the future,"" the FCO stated in an email to The Register, providing its own emphasis when responding to a question about the island's connectivity campaigners.

""The five resolutions in the treaty are, in any case, non-binding even for states that sign up to it,"" added the FCO, which told The Reg it would not bankroll the cable project.

For those who have forgotten, this ITU treaty is the international communication systems treaty against which Google campaigned so fiercely. The web giant managed to convince much of the world that the ITU agreement was a genuine threat to the freedom of the internet - not that Google cared enough to actually join the ITU: it prefers to lobby quietly and sent along staff as part of the US government delegation.

That treaty was signed by more than half the planet's nations, but not the UK which dutifully followed the US out of negotiations.

The high-speed South Atlantic Express fibre cable will run from Cape Town in South Africa to Fortaleza in Brazil. It was going to lie north of St Helena until campaigners convinced eFive Telecoms to route the connection further south. Now the islanders need someone to pay £10m or so to bridge the connection from a junction box on the cable to the island - that someone being the UK government and by extension its taxpayers.

There are about 4,200 people living on St Helena, which is too remote for all but the largest of aircraft and thus needs a decent airport if it's going to develop some tourism and reduce its reliance on a government subsidy. That's the plan that publicly justifies the expense of the airport, but with only 10Mb/sec of satellite connectivity to the internet (at best) shared between the whole population, tourists will really be able to get away from it all.

The fact that St Helena is on route to The Falklands is probably equally important to the airport plan. It's still 3,800 miles (6,200km) from the disputed islands, but that's a good deal closer than the UK. Having a decent airport there won't do any harm to our military aspirations, which won't be helped at all by fitting a 155Mbps internet connection even if it is a good deal cheaper. ®

### Bootnote

* It's been pointed out to us that all is not necessarily lost for St Helena as funding may yet appear from the UK government's Department for International Development, according to the island's internet campaigners. However, the policy at the FCO remains that ""telecommunications for St Helena is the responsibility of the St Helena Government"" even if airports aren't - and no funds from the FCO will be forthcoming.","The article discusses the need for St Helena to connect to an undersea fiber optic cable, highlighting the financial struggles to secure this connection and the implications for internet connectivity on the island.

By February this year, the ‘Red Sea crisis’ had escalated to become a major issue for the international telecoms community, with submarine cables in the region being badly damaged, severely disrupting data traffic in Europe, Africa, and Asia.

Whether the damage to these cables was caused deliberately or not [remains unclear](https://totaltele.com/not-us-say-houthi-rebels-as-trio-of-submarine-cables-cut-in-red-sea/), with one prominent theory suggesting that a ship being attacked by rebels hastily deployed its anchor, which then severed the cables.

To make matters worse, efforts to repair the affected cables were heavily delayed, both due to the militarised nature of the area, as well as by [legal challenges](https://totaltele.com/red-sea-cable-repairs-delayed-as-yemeni-govt-probes-aae-1-consortium/) related to the Yemeni government.

The impact of this lengthy saga on data transport in the region has been difficult to measure, but initial estimates suggested around [25% of data traffic](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68478828) had been affected.

Today, however, a new whitepaper from RETN suggests that this figure has been drastically underestimated, with their own metrics putting the amount of traffic disrupted at up to 70%.

This figure is based on the company’s own network diagnostics and feedback from customers, including major consumer ISPs in Southeast Asia.

RETN uses this data as a springboard to discuss the wider issue of submarine cable system resiliency, calling for the creation of additional data routes to avoid ‘single points of failure’.

Alongside the cable incidents in the Red Sea, the paper also points at damage to the SEA-ME-WE 5 cable in the Strait of Malacca – another submarine cable bottleneck – in April this year. This damage was particularly damaging to connectivity in Bangladesh, where SMW-5 is one of just two subsea cables connecting the country. According to the report, the damage to the cable reduced Bangladesh’s internet capacity by a third.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, smaller and less economically developed countries are less likely to be supported by a wider range of data transport routes, making them particularly vulnerable to largescale disruption.

“We are at a pivotal moment in network connectivity, and to be fully transparent, the industry is not equipped to meet current demands,” said RETN’s CEO Tony O’Sullivan. “With geopolitical events, natural disasters, cable cuts, design flaws, cybersecurity attacks and a shortage of new cables, we’re really not too far away from entire countries becoming digitally inaccessible when the one or two cables that connect them go down.”

The paper argues that the process of building the new systems is moving too slowly, hampered by geopolitical tensions, regulatory issues, and ongoing supply chain shortages.

RETN, therefore, is calling on industry to redouble its efforts in creating new data routes, calling for “at least 4 routes for any geography, preferably 5+” to ensure lasting resiliency.

“Having the global infrastructure in place to overcome these challenges requires industry-wide investment, but that means a wide-reaching movement of prioritising customers over short-term gains. Undoubtedly, there are some key players with the power that can take actionable steps immediately to make a difference,” said O’Sullivan.

This is the second time the AAG hit pause this year, following a reset last January.  

Internet connections in Vietnam are expected to run at snail’s pace in the coming week as a major undersea cable will go under repair.  

A local internet service provider said the Asia America Gateway (AAG) is being fixed and work will reach the part connected to Vietnam' southern beach town Vung Tau on Sunday. It is scheduled to finish on June 5.  

The incident would affect all service providers in Vietnam, meaning that internet users will have to face the sluggish speed on international websites.  

Several internet service providers are ready to reroute and transfer signals to other cables to minimize the impacts on users.  

This is the second time the AAG encountered a technical problem this year, following a reset last January, and at least five similar incidents in 2017.  

Connected in November 2009, the $560-million AAG handles more than 60 percent of the country’s international internet traffic. The system runs more than 20,000 kilometers (12,420 miles), connecting Southeast Asia and the U.S., passing through Brunei, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.  

Vietnam currently has six submarine cable systems, as well as a 120 gigabit channel that runs overland through China. With a download speed of 5.46 megabytes per second, Vietnam's internet speed was ranked 74th out of 189 countries and territories in a global survey of broadband speeds compiled by Cable.co.uk, a U.K. broadband, TV, phone and mobile provider, last August.  

Vietnam's average broadband speed was 10 times lower than its Southeast Asian neighbor Singapore, according to the survey. However, the country still managed to trump six other countries in the region.  

More than 50 million people in Vietnam, or more than half of the country’s population, are online.","The article titled 'Vietnam’s internet to crawl as repair work starts on infamous cable' discusses the repair of the Asia America Gateway (AAG) undersea cable, which is a direct reference to an incident involving cut sea cables.

The cable from Venezuela reached Cuba back in February, but the long awaited improved services and access have yet to materialize.

HAVANA TIMES, August 6 — The “ALBA-1” double fiber optic cable still doesn’t offer service to Internet and telephone users in Cuba. The date for activating the project has been put back several times, with the last missed benchmark being July.

Boris Moreno Cordoves, the vice minister of Communications & Informatics, now says that improved services could begin in September or October of this year.

The laying of the cable from Venezuela to Santiago de Cuba was completed in February.

Announcements have repeatedly been made concerning the implementation of a project that promises to multiply the speed of data, image and voice transmissions by 3,000 times the capacity that Cuba currently possesses.

Meanwhile, islanders have been waiting for the arrival of that moment with great expectations.

Internet users continue experiencing the same frustratingly slow and difficult access to the web (Cuba has one of the lowest connection rates in the hemisphere).

According to official figures, 1.6 million users accessed the Internet in Cuba in 2009 (of a population of 11.2 million). Nevertheless, that figure includes the great majority of those who don’t have full access; rather, they enjoy limited e-mail service or simply the national intranet, with many sites that are outdated.

For many years Cuba has attributed its connection limitations to the United States embargo, which has forced the island to use a satellite connection that is much slower and significantly more expensive than a physical connection.

**The “ALBA-1 cable”**

A Cuban-Venezuelan joint-venture (Telecomunicaciones Gran Caribe), owned by the state-run telecommunications companies of the two countries, is the entity that has moved the project forward. Responsibility for installing the line was held by Shanghai Bell, the Chinese subsidiary of the French firm Alcatel-Lucent. Shanghai Bell is experienced in the installation of lines having done this in many parts of the world.

Vice minister of Communications and Informatics Boris Moreno now says services could begin in September or October.

According to Jose Ignacio Quintero, the project manager for the installation, the cable will have a capacity of around 80 million simultaneous telephone calls, though part of that bandwidth will be for Internet service. In addition, it will have 640 gigabytes of capacity for connections abroad.

After the final connection, users will be able to “have access to international calls” to and from Cuba “without having to wait,” commented Quintero when the ship arrived with the fiber optic cable from Venezuela this past February.

The Cuban-American owned TeleCuba Company had previously proposed running a cable from Key West to the island — only 108 miles, and therefore cheaper than the Venezuelan connection — but Cuba did not respond to the offer.

The current cable had to travel almost ten times that distance (994 miles from Camuri Venezuela to Siboney Cuba) at a cost of more than US $70,000,000.

According to the Granma newspaper, “The blockade prevents Cuba from being connected to any one of nearly a dozen international connections that surround us. For example, one of these cables (Cancun-Miami) passes as close as only 20 miles from the Havana seawall.”

**Getting online in Cuba**

Notwithstanding the Cuban government’s attempt to socialize Internet service in state-run schools, workplaces, health, research and cultural facilities, sentiment on the island contradicts such aims. For many Cubans, the services offered are highly insufficient.

In the majority of the cases access to open Internet is conditioned by strict regulations that prohibit personal and creative use of available services.

In the opinion of blogger and activist Yasmin S. Portales, access to the Internet at government institutions is achieved through the “professional, educational or political contacts” of the user, as well as according to the “judgments of the directors of those centers relative to the social purpose of their terminals.” Under such controls, “those who access will be alienated from their freedom to navigate the web a priori, limited by the standards of political/moral correctness of its network’s administrator,” stressed Portales.

Generally, the regulations of computer security are applied in a discretionary manner, varying from ministry to ministry. Nor are the standards of censorship uniform.

Optometry technician Jimmy Roque Martinez explained that in the last few weeks, instead of increasing the navigational speed and accessibility of the Infomed network, which belongs to the Cuban Ministry of Health, these capacities have declined. Roque, who is also an activist member of the Critical Observatory, reports that when using his personal Infomed account he can no longer even access certain national websites such as Granma, Juventud Rebelde or Trabajadores newspapers.

Nevertheless, he checked to find that it’s still possible to access these sites from institutional health system connections.

One source (who wished not to be identified) told HT that the Youth Computer Club they attend in an eastern province generally offers very limited connection time and without the ability to log onto Facebook. However, if a user declares that they intend to “speak well of the Cuban Revolution and the Cuban Five” on some website — including Facebook — they are granted limitless time.

Cultural institutions seem to be those that offer services (free as well as at moderate rates) to the greatest number of people. The Cubarte network accommodates many institutions and national creators by offering a range of payment plans. As part of their missions, several of these institutions offer Internet surfing services to their users, but with the aforementioned limitations.

**Yes, but no**

At the end of 2008, computerization process official Carlos Oporto explained that Cuba’s strategy was related to an “orderly and intensive social use of the media and connectivity.” This was stated in a workshop where another official of the Telecommunications & Informatics Ministry — when referring to the Internet — revealed that “We don’t have the infrastructure for this.”

It’s been almost three years and yet they still don’t seem prepared.

Before the International Relations Commission of the Cuban National Assembly, Bruno Moreno just pointed out to the deputies: “The Cuba-Venezuela cable is just short of going into operation, and now it’s necessary to begin transferring the channels, which implies sitting down with the service providers and beginning to transfer services in September or October.”

The Granma newspaper, as well as the rest of the printed Cuban press, has omitted all information related to the Internet. According to Yohandry Fontana’s blog, the vice minister emphasized that the responsible position for Cuba is that in this context of financial limitations, blockade and aggression, “We will continue improving access where it’s necessary for the country’s development.”

Months ago, Granma, the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party had already made it clear that, “The underwater cable will provide greater quality in info-communication, but this will not necessarily mean an expansion of these services. The socialization of service will depend more on seeking efficiency than on the amplification of the network.”

During his presentation last week to the parliament committee, Boris Moreno commented that, “The political will exists for expanding the services of the Internet to the degree that economic resources allow the development of the infrastructure necessary for it, because the massive entry onto the Internet requires significant investments for that to be progressively carried out, and that depends on the number of users to serve. Access for personal use will be offered to the degree that the capacity allows this.”

Back in 2008 Carlos Oporto stated that fiber optics already existed internally in Cuba, so it was only a question of waiting a few years for the authorities responsible to prepare the necessary infrastructure. But because the recent statements by vice minister Moreno were not made public, we don’t know how much work has still yet to be carried out, or whether he even told the deputies.

Contradicting Waldo Reboredo, the vice-president of Telecomunicaciones Gran Caribe, who had stated months earlier that the fiber optic cable “would reduce the costs of current operations by 25 percent,” Moreno told the National Assembly committee that “this investment will guarantee safer access and will improve the quality of the connections, but it won’t mean a reduction in the costs that Cuba pays for Internet access.”

For the moment, the public’s expectations are yet to be fulfilled. The privileged few who have their slow connections to the Internet are waiting anxiously for a change. Will Cubans be able to contract for Internet services in their homes? Will the price for the service be reduced at tourist centers? Will speed improve for everyone? Will they reduce the charges for telephone services?

Residents on the remote South Atlantic territory of St Helena have renewed their plea for the UK to back plans to bring broadband to the island.

The British Overseas Territory needs £10m to connect to a submarine cable.

The island's 4,200 residents currently rely on a slow satellite connection, which campaigners say is stunting the island's growth.

The Foreign Office has said a ""full economic assessment"" was needed before any new link could be funded.

The UK, like several other countries, refused to sign a proposed UN treaty regarding wide-ranging changes to internet governance at a conference in Dubai last month. It meant a clause requiring states to aid in connecting remote communities will not now be enforced, removing any obligation or commitment for the government to work with communities such as St Helena.

""The UK did not sign the revised International Telecommunication Regulations last week in Dubai, and has no intention of doing so in the future,"" the Foreign Office said in an email.

Campaign group A Human Right, which is supported by the UN, has called on the Department for International Development to contribute a substantial amount to the engineering costs of connecting the island to the South Atlantic Express, a new superfast fibre optic cable being laid by South African firm eFive.

An investment of around £10m, campaigners said, would be enough to latch on to the cable and ""revolutionise"" the island - with private backers contributing further costs.

Due to the island's location, it is well-placed to support infrastructure relating to satellite operations, including base stations and communication hubs.

The government is already spending £250m on the island to build a new airport in a bid to encourage high-spend tourism to the island which is one of the most remote on earth.

Currently, the UK government spends £20m a year on supporting the island.

In an email to A Human Right, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said telecommunications on the island was the responsibility of the St Helena Government.

Campaigners hope that with better internet access local residents, particularly young people, will be less inclined to leave the island for study and work purposes.

Mike Olffon, owner of the island's radio station Saint FM, told the BBC that getting access was prohibitively expensive. ""Internet here at the moment is tremendously expensive because it's satellite - it's well over £100 a month. We have no choice.""","The article discusses the need for St Helena to connect to a submarine cable, mentioning a required investment of £10 million.

Three out of six cables connecting Pakistan to the world have developed faults one after the other.

**KARACHI:** Internet speed in Pakistan has slowed down to half after international infrastructure partially collapsed on Saturday.

Three out of the total six cables connecting Pakistan to the world have developed faults one after the other in the last couple of months.

Among the three faulty cables, the latest one is the submarine cable system IMEWE (India-Middle East-Western Europe) which developed a fault early on Saturday morning.

Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) operates the cable in Pakistan, as part of the international consortium that owns the cable worldwide.

PTCL General Manager Imran Janjua told *The Express Tribune* that the fault occurred near Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. ""A team representing the international consortium has been activated to diagnose the fault and remove this.

""The team will shortly submit a report disclosing the cause of the fault and the estimated time required for repair.

""The repair would definitely take a few days depending upon the nature of the fault,"" he said.

Internet users may continue to face the situation for quite a long time, as another cable SEA-ME-WE4, also owned by PTCL, is already under repair by an international consortium for over one month now.

The cable carries faults in the Karachi, Pakistan region.

The third faulty cable connecting Pakistan to the world, TW-1, which is owned by Transworld, has been faulty for over a month now as well.

The disruption in the global internet infrastructure has impacted broadband users from all walks of life in Pakistan, including mobile broadband 3G/4G/LTE users, landline users, and corporate users having dedicated speed connections.

The speed would have gone dead-slow if Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) had not connected the country to the world via the latest and largest submarine cable (AAE1) last month.

**""This [move of traffic] has caused breaking the internet speed in Pakistan, as three cables are sharing the burden of the faulty cables,""** an official at a mobile phone service providing firm commented.

He said internet users on cellular broadband were equally impacted. They, like others, have, however, successfully switched their customers to the working cables by the PTCL.

**""The speed may remain slow till the faulty cables are restored,""** he said.

PTCL Chief Business Development Officer Sikandar Naqi said in a press statement that customers would experience slow internet browsing. “In order to minimize the service impact, the PTCL has undertaken necessary measures to arrange additional/alternate bandwidth through its other cable systems and international cable business partners,"" he said.

According to another industry official, Pakistan is not the only country in the world facing slowdown in internet speed, but the other countries which have moved to alternate cables from the faulty ones are also facing a similar situation.","The article discusses the impact of multiple submarine cable failures on internet connectivity in Pakistan, detailing specific incidents and their implications.

Google is making a big bet on market growth in South Africa and potentially other countries on the African continent.  

The company announced Friday that it is funding construction of its own new submarine cable that will connect Lisbon to Cape Town. Running along Africa’s west coast, the cable is designed to make it possible in the future to add branches along its length that land in other points along the coast. The first such branch has already been decided and will land in Lagos, Nigeria.  

While Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet, has funded 13 submarine-cable construction projects over the years, this is only the third time the company is paying for an entire cable on its own. Most of its investments have been as part of consortia that typically get together to fund this kind of infrastructure.  

The consortia have traditionally consisted of telecommunications companies and governments, but in recent years started to sometimes include tech giants that operate global cloud platforms, such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon. The tech companies invest in cables to ensure they not only have enough transcontinental bandwidth in their network backbones but also redundant paths to route traffic around downed connections.  

Google funding it alone means the Equiano system – named after the Nigerian-born writer and abolitionist Olaudah Equiano – will be built faster, according to a blog post authored by three of Google’s infrastructure team leads. It also means Google will have the cable’s bandwidth all to itself if needed. The company said the system will provide about 20 times more capacity than the last one built to serve the region.  

Alcatel Submarine Networks will build the cable, whose first phase, connecting South Africa to Portugal, is expected to be finished in 2021.  

According to Google, Equiano will also be the first subsea cable capable of “optical switching at the fiber-pair level” instead of “traditional wavelength-level switching.” This technology will allow Google to add and reallocate capacity in different parts of the system as needed, the company said.  

Google didn’t say how much it was expecting to spend on the project, but submarine-cable builds of this scale typically cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Treating investment in its global infrastructure as a way to gain advantage over competitors, Google said it has spent $47 billion on data centers and network infrastructure just in the last three years, stepping up efforts to win public-cloud market share from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and others.  

Its cloud services already seem to enjoy widespread use in South Africa, but it has yet to build a data center there. Earlier this year Microsoft, which is also already a major cloud player in the market, became the first of international cloud giants to launch data centers in the country; Amazon Web Services expects to launch cloud facilities there next year.  

Commenting on Microsoft and Amazon’s activity, Jon Tullett, a Johannesburg-based IDC analyst, told Quartz that public cloud could become a “billion-dollar market” in South Africa. He also said there was currently a “short-term acceleration in growth” in cloud and related services there and in other countries on the continent.  

Illustrating just how much the market for digital services in South Africa is expected to pick up in the near future is the amount of submarine-cable building activity taking place there.  

Google’s Equiano isn’t the only new submarine cable that will land in the country over the next several years, according to TeleGeography’s Submarine Cable Map. Six cables land in South Africa today, and six more are expected to come online over the next three years, not including Google’s system. Three of the cables in progress will land in Cape Town. (None currently land in the city, although two land not far up the coast.) The six new systems will expand the region’s connectivity to North America, South America, Europe, Middle East, and Asia.  

Thirteen cables land in Portugal today, and one more is expected to launch in 2020, linking it to Brazil, Capo Verde, and French Guiana.","The article discusses Google's funding of a new submarine cable, the Equiano, which connects Lisbon to Cape Town and is designed to enhance internet connectivity in Africa.

Therefore, Vietnam’s internet will only return to normal by April 5.

The newspaper added that problems with the AAG cable occurred on February 18. This happened while repairs were in progress on one of the country’s main submarine cables, the Intra-Asia (IA) cable, which malfunctioned in early February.

The delay is largely due to the complexity of the breakage, as both the Singapore-bound and Hong Kong-bound branches have had issues. While work on the Singapore-bound branch might take until April 1 instead of March 25 as predicted, the status of the Hong Kong-bound branch is still undetermined.

Some believe it's by looking up to the heavens.

Not in hope of divine intervention, but as an opportunity: satellite-powered broadband could be the answer to Africa's connectivity conundrum.

The internet is, as one US senator once put it, a series of tubes.

His comments went down in internet folklore and were roundly mocked - but his remarks were loosely true. For the internet to get around the world it needs cables - lots of them.

They cost millions, span entire oceans and meander across deserts. Many are laid through some of the world's most volatile areas, such as Syria.

So when it comes to connecting Africa to the high-speed information super-highway, the enormity of the task cannot be over-exaggerated.

In the past few years, the continent has benefited from major investment into its internet economy.

Since 2009, three high-speed internet cables have been laid across the ocean, reaching out from Europe and Asia, and bringing huge speed increases - not to mention lower costs - to east Africa.

Kenya has arguably made the most of this connectivity. In just 12 months after the installation of the high-speed cables, the number of Kenyans on broadband rocketed from 1.8 million to more than 3 million.

With a lot of businesses now able to set themselves up and serve customers online, savings were able to be made across the board.

But cables are expensive - and they break. Earlier this year, cables linking east Africa to the Middle East and Europe were severed in an accident.

Internet users' connectivity suffered for more than three weeks - with data transfer rates in nine countries taking a serious, crippling hit. Such long-term technical problems undermine Africa's credibility as a potential future global technology hub.

Coupled with the logistical barrier associated with enabling internet connections in the most rural parts of Africa, and it's arguable that a rethink is desperately needed.

Avanti's rethink launched into space on 2 August.

The company says its satellite, Hylas 2, will bring high speed connectivity to southern and eastern Africa, the Middle East and the central Asia.

The growth potential for businesses on the ground, Avanti chief executive David Williams says, is simply enormous.

""We have always believed there is a huge opportunity for satellite communications services in emerging markets because growth for data and voice services is high whilst supply of telecoms network capacity is low,"" Mr Williams says.

""This is very attractive to Government and enterprise customers, particularly those working in oil, mining, agriculture, banking and security sectors.""

The satellite is the company's second to reach orbit. The first, Hylas 1, went up in 2010, and the company plans another - Hylas 3 - for 2015.

Hylas is shorthand for ""Highly Adaptable Satellite"", an apt name which describes one of its key attributes - the ability to direct its beams to different areas of the continent in order to satisfy demand.

All of the satellites utilise the Ka-band frequency, which operates in the 30Ghz section of the radio spectrum. Avanti says this means it is able to offer 99.9% uptime, no matter what the weather conditions may be.

It is hoped that the satellites build on the progress brought by the undersea cables and lower the cost of broadband further, be it residential users or those running a business.

Although costs have become far cheaper since cable installations, broadband is still prohibitively expensive.

For example, in Kenya, a small business broadband connection can cost around £60 a month for a relatively slow connection of 256kb per second.

With the new satellites, Avanti says it can offer 8MB connection speeds for around £20 - a dramatic rise in speed coupled with what some believe is a game-changing drop in price.

""Whatever the investments that you see happening, they will [all] make the internet cheaper,"" says Paul Kukubo, chief executive of the Kenyan ICT board.

""The internet is getting cheaper anyway,"" he tells the BBC.

""It's getting cheaper on two accounts - investments and also the economies of scale.

""As more people get connected, it's more effective financially to actually invest and therefore the internet gets cheaper.""

He argued that lessons can be learned from the mobile networks who, with enhanced technology, were able to offer individuals and businesses attractively-priced internet connectivity, even in rural areas.

As a result, Africa has in fact left the developed world in its wake when it comes to adopting breakthrough mobile technologies - particularly mobile payments such as the hugely popular M-Pesa system.

In Angola, this kind of mobile connectivity is being taken to the next level. In partnership with Chinese telecoms firm ZTE, the country is rolling out 4G mobile infrastructure.

It means Angola, which just over 10 years ago was in the grip of a civil war, will offer its citizens better and faster mobile coverage than is currently on offer in London. Other countries, like Namibia, are attempting to follow suit.

Africa's surge in mobile internet use can be repeated in the fixed broadband world, Mr Kukubo says.

""We've got good examples of people who have made money by providing connectivity to the rural communities,"" he said.

""The large telephone networks have priced their products in a way that allows people to access it through cellphones.""

He believes that by encouraging more businesses to adopt broadband services, the knock-on effect will see a significant change in costs as prices are lowered across the board.

""As consumers [learn] what to do online, you get greater usage, and that usage also drives the prices down, and also drives greater business applications, greater consumer applications.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, including their importance for internet connectivity in Africa and specific incidents where cables were severed, leading to significant connectivity issues.

Kenyans rely on slow and expensive satellite connections to the internet, but will not benefit from high-speed access until all three of The East African Marine Systems (Teams) cables are in place.

The project is a joint venture between the Kenyan government, Emirates Telecommunication Technology and a consortium of local investors. It costs one Kenyan shilling (one cent) a minute to surf the net in internet cafes in the capital, Nairobi.

**MOGADISHU:** A severed marine cable has left Somalia without internet for weeks, triggering losses for businesses, residents said, and adding a layer of chaos in a country where militant insurgents are carrying out a campaign of bombings and killings.

Abdi Anshuur, Somalia's minister for posts and telecommunications, told state radio that internet to the Horn of Africa state went down a month ago after a ship cut an undersea cable connecting it to global data networks.

Businesses have had to close or improvise to remain open and university students told Reuters their educational courses had been disrupted.

Anshuur said the outage was costing Somalia the equivalent of about $10 million in economic output.

""The night internet went off marked the end of my daily bread,"" Mohamed Nur, 22, told Reuters in the capital Mogadishu.

Nur said he now begged ""tea and cigarettes from friends"" after the internet cutoff also severed his monthly income of $500 that he took in from ads he developed and placed on the video website, YouTube.

Somalia's economy is still picking up slowly after a combined force of the army and an African Union peacekeeping force helped drive the militant group, al Shabaab, out of Mogadishu and other strongholds.

Al Shabaab wants to topple the western backed government and rule according to its strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law.

The group remains formidable and lethal, with its campaign of frequent bombings and killings a key source of significant security risk for most businesses and regular life.

Now the internet outage potentially compounds the hardships for most firms. Most young people who say they are unable to work because of the outage spend hours idling in front of tea shops.

Mohamed Ahmed Hared, commercial manager of Somali Optical Networks(SOON), a large internet service provider in the country, told Reuters his business was losing over a million dollars a day.

Hared's clients, he said, had reported a range of crippled services including passport and e-tickets printing and money remittances.

Some students and staff at the University of Somalia in Mogadishu told Reuters their learning had been disrupted because Google, which they heavily rely on for research, was now inaccessible.

If you've been experiencing poor internet service of late, you are not alone. Many users have been sharing their unpleasant experiences on social media since Sunday, June 18th and the situation doesn't seem to be improving much.

From all indications, the origin of this problem is neither the frequent rains nor the intermittent power supply. But it can mostly be traced back outside Africa and to one company -- MainOne.

For those who may not know, MainOne is a Nigeria-based internet and telecoms solution provider. Founded in 2009 by [Funke Opeke](https://techpoint.ng/2017/06/06/how-funke-opeke-funded-mainone/), the company achieved the ""impossible"" in 2010 when it successfully ran a 14,000km submarine cable all the way from Portugal to South Africa. With landings in [8 West African countries](https://www.mainone.net/our-network/coverage/), MainOne has easily the widest reach of any network provider in the region.

![MainOne's terrestrial landing points in West Africa](https://techpoint.africa/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mainone-internet-service-landings.jpg)

So it comes as no surprise that the company provides wholesale internet for many of your favourite local internet service providers (ISPs) in Benin, Togo, Ghana and Nigeria. However, over the weekend, an unexpected outage occured that didn't become pronounced until the start of the working week. This was confirmed in an email to Techpoint:

> MainOne hereby advises its customers that early in the morning of Sunday June 18th, 2017, we experienced a fault on our submarine cable system, 3000km offshore Portugal. The outage, the first of its kind in 7 years since our cable system came into operations, has caused disruptions in service to our international connectivity customers in West Africa.

If you follow global news closely, you may have observed that the timeline coincides with the genesis of the forest fire incident in the Pedrogao Grande municipality of Portugal that has now [claimed over 62 lives](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/18/europe/portugal-fire/index.html).

We are yet to confirm that these two seemingly separate incidents are connected. Considering that the submarine cable originates from Seixal -- a 2-hour drive from Pedrogao Grande -- it is not likely so, especially as the official statement pins the fault to a location ""3000km from Portugal"".

But it's not just the internet providers that are affected. Beyond being an internet service wholesaler, MainOne also offers co-location services for big enterprises including like banks in Nigeria. So if you've also been experiencing fluctuations in internet banking service, chances are your bank shares some server space in [MainOne's data centre](https://techpoint.ng/2015/09/16/main-one-mdx-i-lagos-tour/).

Techpoint has yet to confirm this either. So far, we can only confirm a possible timeline of resolution. According to the email we received:

> Action is being taken to mobilise the repair vessel that is closest to the point of failure. The expected time for full restoration is estimated at +/- 5 days; but we will provide more precise timing as soon as we know and the vessel is at the repair location.

In parallel, we are lining up some immediate restoration capacity to provide a measure of relief to our Internet customers, but there simply is not enough to meet the need, nor to redirect all the dedicated circuits in the time we have to restore.

In other words, you will have to wait a bit longer before everything is back to normal. Meanwhile, if you've started experiencing passable internet service of late, it's because many of these same providers that are dependent on MainOne have alternatives. Glo for example has its [Glo-1 submarine cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLO-1) and MTN is part owner of the [West Africa Cable System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WACS_\(cable_system\)). However, these systems are so limited in a country like Nigeria for example, that telcos still have to rely on MainOne for a wider broadband reach.

This is a developing story. We will serve you additional official statements from MainOne as they come in.

* * *

_**UPDATE 1**: We received an updated statement from MainOne that pins the fault to somewhere in the **Atlantic Ocean** and gives estimated repair time of **14 days**:_

_Supported by our cable maintenance arrangement with the Atlantic Cable Maintenance & Repair Agreement (ACMA), we immediately mobilized a repair vessel from France early Monday morning to pick up the necessary spares and personnel to recover the affected sections of the submarine cable in the Atlantic Ocean and effect repairs. The current estimated time for the repairs may be up to 14 days._

_Whilst this is an event of Force Majeure, being beyond our control in the ordinary and normal course of business, we have in the interim, made available existing restoration capacity and have secured additional capacity to offer temporary relief to our customers, where feasible. We will continue to provide updates on the progress of the repair works as we assure our customers that all hands are on deck to fully restore all services and the MainOne quality that they have come to rely on. We thank you for your understanding and apologize for the inconveniences caused._

It’s unclear exactly if any ISPs are immediately utilizing the new capacity, but the launch is over three years (and US$650 million) in the making. Activation of the cable comes over a year since the cable first landed in South Africa. WACS is also the first direct submarine cable to link Europe, West Africa, and South Africa in over ten years.

Internet connectivity has become a very topical issue since March 14, 2024, when it was confirmed that undersea cables that serve most West African countries had been disrupted.

Ghana's three telecommunications outfits recorded massive drops in data service quality even as the regulators - the National Communications Authority (NCA) and the Telecoms Chamber - worked to give crucial information to the public.

Per the NCA's last update, dated March 16, 2024; it had held a meeting with the management of telecom service providers in the country (MTN, AirtelTigo and Telecel) as well as all four (4) subsea cable landing service providers (ACE, MainOne, SAT-3 and WACS).

""The subsea cable landing service providers have indicated an estimated time frame of a minimum of five (5) weeks for full-service restoration from the time the vessels are dispatched to the various locations,"" their statement read in part.

**But what have the telcos been saying?**

**STATEMENT: MTN Ghana apologises for internet challenges**  
**March 14, 2024**  
Mobile Telecommunications Network(MTN) Ghana has issued an apology to its subscribers for the difficulties they encountered in accessing data services and reaching its call centre. The telecommunications company has assured its customers that it is actively working to address the issue.

In a statement, MTN Ghana explained that the disruption in service is a result of issues with their international undersea cables. The company's technical teams are collaborating with international partners to swiftly resolve the problem.  
""We deeply regret any inconvenience caused and are committed to keeping our subscribers informed as we work towards a resolution,"" the statement from MTN Ghana emphasized.

**STATEMENT: Telecel Ghana Network upgrade**  
**March 16, 2024**  
Telecel Ghana has multiple sources of internet services through SAT3, WACS, ACE, and submarine fibre links to other international providers. On the 12th of March 2024, Telecel Ghana lost internet capacity provided by WACS subsea cable and immediately switched to ACE to maintain service. On 14th March 2024, Telecel Ghana lost internet connectivity from its remaining providers SAT3 and ACE due to a cut in their undersea cables. This resulted in the disruption of data services on Mobile and Fixed networks.

Telecel Ghana has now secured new internet capacity and is progressively adding more capacities through local and international partners, including other Telecel subsidiaries. This is in addition to local caching solutions which are enabling access to some content services such as YouTube, Facebook, Netflix etc.

Telecel Ghana sincerely appreciates the patience and understanding of its customers during this period. All customers will be refunded accordingly.

Please note that information circulating on social media platforms about the disconnection of Telecel Ghana due to debts owed is false and should be disregarded.

**FACEBOOK POST: AirtelTigo**  
AirtelTigo at the time of filing this report were the best internet service provider as compared to the two others. In their case, the company has leveraged its reliability to boost its data services and sales.

The cable will transform communications in Cuba, which has among the slowest internet speeds in the world.

The new connection will make download speeds 3,000 times faster - at least for the small minority of Cubans who have internet access.

It should also make international phone calls much cheaper.

The 1,600km (1,000 mile) cable from Venezuela was financed by the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (Alba) - a left-wing regional grouping founded by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.

Cuban Information and Communications Minister Medardo Diaz said it ""reinforced Cuba's sovereignty"" and ""opened a breach"" in the US economic blockade.

The cable would ""be at the service of our people, as a tool to reinforce its development, integration and sovereignty"" when it became operational in July, he added.

Until now, Cuba has relied on internet and international telephone connections via satellite, which is expensive and slow.

Cuba's communist government has always blamed its poor communications links with the outside world on the decades-old US trade embargo, which has prevented the installation of a fibre optic cable to Florida, just 144km away.

**Broader access?**

The arrival of the fibre-optic cable has raised enormous expectations in Cuba, says the BBC's Fernando Ravsberg in Havana.

According to official Cuban statistics, only 3% of the population have access to the web - the lowest figure in the western hemisphere.

Access is restricted and available only with government permission - although since 2009 Cubans have been able to use internet cafes, mostly in hotels, and there is a strong black market for internet connections.

Last November the official Communist Party newspaper, Granma, sought to lower expectations.

""The underwater cable will provide higher quality communications, but not necessarily mean a broader extension of the same,"" it said.

The Cuban government says there is no ""political obstacle"" to the internet in Cuba.

But opposition groups - including the prominent dissident blogger [Yoani Sanchez, external](http://www.desdecuba.com/generationy/) - say the authorities have always sought to control sources of information and free expression.","The article discusses the arrival of a new undersea fiber-optic cable linking Cuba to Venezuela, which significantly impacts internet connectivity in Cuba.

A roadmap setting out measures to protect Europe’s submarine cables, or cable projects of European interest (CPEI), is set to be unveiled on Wednesday, according to a report by Reuters.

""This Recommendation aims to encourage the deployment or significant upgrade of submarine cable infrastructure via CPEIs in compliance with EU law, including state aid rules,"" a European Commission proposal seen by Reuters said.

**How Europe could bolster its subsea cable network**
Subsea cables deliver 97 percent of global Internet traffic, and as such damage or sabotage of this infrastructure is seen by many governments as a significant security risk.

The term CPEI refers to a project jointly delivered by governments and the private sector, and the European Commission proposal said member states should appoint a group of experts to look at which CPEIs are of greatest strategic importance to Europe, and how these can be improved and protected.

""This recommendation invites Member States to adopt measures to ensure that submarine cable infrastructure operators meet the highest security standards (including defence-level standards, where appropriate),"" the document seen by Reuters said.

Funding could be provided from existing EU programs such as the European Investment Bank, as well as private investors, it added.

**China and Russia’s threat to subsea cables**
A separate report on the proposals by Euractiv suggests the EU could seek to ban what it deems “high-risk suppliers” from having any involvement in the roll-out of new subsea cables.

It cites Chinese providers such as Huawei, which provides such infrastructure through its HNM Tech subsidiary, and ZTE as those that could face bans or restrictions.

Last October, two subsea cables in the Baltic Sea, along with a gas pipeline, were damaged by a Chinese container ship, with an investigation by Finnish authorities suggesting this may have been a deliberate attempt at sabotage.

NATO has also warned that Russia could look to damage subsea cables in an attempt to destabilize Western countries as its war in Ukraine continues.","The article titled 'Europe plans investment to boost subsea cable security' discusses the significance of subsea cables, which deliver 97% of global Internet traffic.

Preciss International is a company waiting to take off.  
  
**In a fourth-storey apartment block close to the centre of Kenya's capital, Nairobi, 30 young men and women are crouched in front of computers.**  
  
Some are working in what used to be one of the bedrooms, and the others are in the former sitting room.  
They are the vanguard of an industry in Kenya that is waiting to take off.  
They are employees of Preciss International, an out-sourcing company run by Mugure Mugo.  
She set up the company five years ago with one colleague.  
""I did the marketing and contract work, my one employee did the data processing,"" she says.  
""I checked it in the evening and we sent it off the following day to the client.""  
**Right ingredients**  
Her office, by the way, is what used to be a guest bedroom in the apartment.  
  
**We are held back by the fact that all our data and calls go via satellite. This is very expensive and is one of the big obstacles to growth.**  
  
Since those early days the business has expanded and is about to grow bigger still with the backing of an investor.  
Kenya has all the right ingredients for outsourcing work, except one: communication speeds.  
""We are held back by the fact that all our data and calls go via satellite,"" Ms Mugo says.  
""This is very expensive and is one of the big obstacles to growth.""  
Preciss International has a young, very well-educated workforce and have picked up a big multinational client along with a host of smaller ones.  
In the bedroom, a ""data clean-up"" exercise is taking place, where Preciss employees are calling companies all over Africa, checking on names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses.  
Next door in the sitting room, three people are working on subtitling American and British television programmes for the deaf.  
""It's good business,"" says MS Mugure, ""But it takes ages to download the programmes, and that adds to our costs.""  
**Welcome**  
The price of satellite bandwidth is prohibitively high in Kenya and other East African countries.  
A megabyte of satellite-delivered bandwidth in Kenya costs around $7,500, whereas elsewhere in the world a megabyte costs no more than about $400.  
This huge price difference has been a brake on many other businesses as well.  
It has taken a long time, but at last slow connection speeds and expensive internet access are about to end in Kenya.  
In the next few days, the Kenyan government will sign a deal with a French/US engineering company Alcatel-Lucent, to commission a fibre-optic cable from Fujaira in The United Arab Emirates along the sea floor of the Gulf of Oman, down the East African coast to the port town of Mombasa.  
From Mombasa, the government plans to weave a network of fibre-optic cable throughout the country.  
It will be welcomed with open arms in the Browse Internet Access cafe in the centre of Nairobi, where dozens of people are sitting in front of their flat-screens tapping away at the keyboards.  
**Snail's pace**  
The internet speeds at the cafe are fast by Nairobi standards and reliable, but painfully slow compared to what should be available.  
**These young people in schools who knew only their immediate surroundings will have the whole world opened up to them.**  
Bitange Ndemo from Kenya's communication ministry  
Sami Seram is a student. He comes to Browse because the computers at his university are even worse, but he finds doing his bio-chemistry online research very slow going.  
I watched him, waiting while a relatively straightforward page of script was downloading.  
""Look at this,"" he says. ""It's so slow. It takes me a very long time to get hold of what I need, and it's very expensive.""  
Mr Seram reckons he spends about 500 Kenyan shillings a week on internet connections - that is about $7.50.  
In a country where the average annual wage is less than $1,500, this amounts to a substantial outlay, particularly for a student.  
Stephen Onyambu, the boss of Browse says with the cost of satellite bandwidth so high it is impossible to offer internet access any cheaper.  
""We have had to cut our margins down and down,"" he says.  
""But wait, once the fibre optic comes we will be charging just a few cents for internet time.""  
**'Massive change'**  
Work on laying the fibre-optic cable is due to start at the end of the year.  
The ocean floor has been surveyed and now the huge pipe must be laid in an $82m operation.  
Alcatel-Lucent have committed to finish the project in two years.  
Bitange Ndemo, permanent secretary at the Kenyan Ministry of Communication and Information, says they won the contract on cost and speed of delivery.  
He says neighbouring countries and territories like Ethiopia, southern Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo have already asked to be connected.  
He is optimistic about what the fibre-optic cable will deliver to Kenyan business, but the real prize, he thinks, is to be found in rural Kenya.  
""For the youth here - this is going to be such a massive change,"" he says.  
""Many villages in Kenya are being put on the electricity for the first time, and we will give these villages internet access as well.  
""Suddenly, these young people in schools who knew only their immediate surroundings will have the whole world opened up to them.""  
  
It is an enticing prospect but, realistically, it will still be a long time before Kenya is all hooked up to the worldwide web.","The article discusses the commissioning of a fibre-optic cable running from Fujaira in the UAE to Mombasa, Kenya, which is a direct reference to undersea cables.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - A severed marine cable has left Somalia without internet for weeks, triggering losses for businesses, residents said, and adding a layer of chaos in a country where Islamist insurgents are carrying out a campaign of bombings and killings.  

Abdi Anshuur, Somalia's minister for posts and telecommunications, told state radio that internet to the Horn of Africa state went down a month ago after a ship cut an undersea cable connecting it to global data networks.  

Businesses have had to close or improvise to remain open and university students told Reuters their educational courses had been disrupted.  

Anshuur said the outage was costing Somalia the equivalent of about $10 million in economic output.  

""The night internet went off marked the end of my daily bread,"" Mohamed Nur, 22, told Reuters in the capital Mogadishu.  

Nur said he now begged ""tea and cigarettes from friends"" after the internet cutoff also severed his monthly income of $500 that he took in from ads he developed and placed on the video website, YouTube.  

Somalia's economy is still picking up slowly after a combined force of the army and an African Union peacekeeping force helped drive the Islamist group, al Shabaab, out of Mogadishu and other strongholds.  

Al Shabaab wants to topple the western backed government and rule according to its strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law.  

The group remains formidable and lethal, with its campaign of frequent bombings and killings a key source of significant security risk for most businesses and regular life.  

Now the internet outage potentially compounds the hardships for most firms. Most young people who say they are unable to work because of the outage spend hours idling in front of tea shops.  

Mohamed Ahmed Hared, commercial manager of Somali Optical Networks(SOON), a large internet service provider in the country, told Reuters his business was loosing over a million dollars a day.  

Hared's clients, he said, had reported a range of crippled services including passport and e-tickets printing and money remittances.  

Some students and staff at the University of Somalia in Mogadishu told Reuters their learning had been disrupted because google, which they heavily rely on for research, was now inaccessible.  

The absence of especially popular internet sites like Facebook and YouTube and Google was, however, cause for celebration for some in the conservative, Muslim nation.  

""My wife used to be (on) YouTube or Facebook every minute,"" Mohamud Osman, 45, said, adding the online activity would sometimes distract her from feeding her baby and that the habit had once forced him to try to get a divorce.  

""Now I am happy ... internet is without doubt a necessary tool of evil.""

On Thursday, subsea cable providers were affected by major cuts to undersea submarine cables, disrupting internet traffic in major parts of the continent.

This disrupted the **[services of banks and telecommunications companies](https://www.thecable.ng/nigerian-banks-mtn-affected-by-damaged-submarine-cables-in-west-africa)** in Nigeria.

In a statement on Friday, MainOne said an additional two to three weeks of transit time may be required for a vessel to pick up the spares of submarine cables and travel from Europe to West Africa.

Speaking on the cause of the network outage, MainOne said preliminary findings and further investigations showed “the fault occurred due to an external incident that resulted in a cut on its submarine cable system, in the Atlantic Ocean offshore Cote D’Ivoire, along the coast of West Africa”.

“We have a maintenance agreement with Atlantic Cable Maintenance and Repair Agreement (ACMA) to provide repair services for the submarine cable,” the company said.

“First identify and assign a vessel, the vessel has to retrieve the necessary spares required for repair, and then sail to the fault location to conduct the repair work.

“Next, in order to complete the repair, the affected section of the submarine cable will have to be pulled from the seabed onto the ship where it will be spliced by skilled technicians.”

According to MainOne, after repair, joints will be inspected and tested for any defects and subsequently, the submarine cable will be lowered back to the seabed and placed in a good position.

“This process might take 1-2 weeks for repairs while about 2-3 weeks of transit time may be required for the vessel to pick up the spares and travel from Europe to West Africa once the vessel is mobilised,” MainOne said.

In another update on Friday, the company said it is working with cable systems not affected by the incident or previous outages to secure restoration capacity.

MainOne said its technical team is working assiduously to restore services, subject to availability of capacity and service configuration specifics.

“We will also provide incremental updates on the root cause and efforts to repair the submarine cable as soon as those details become available,” the company said.

**MTN: BAYOBAB WORKING WITH PARTNERS TO REPAIR DAMAGED CABLES**

In a statement on Friday, MTN Group said Bayobab, a digital connectivity solutions company,  is working with its partners on the synchronisation of repair work on the damaged underwater digital communication cables along West Africa.

“As confirmed by their consortium partners, on March 14, 2024 four subsea cables were cut. They are WACS, ACE, SAT3 and MainOne,” MTN said.

According to the statement, it is also collaborating with partners to mitigate the impact of the damage by rerouting traffic and enabling more circuits.

“ACE and WACS have jointly initiated the repair process by mobilising a cable ship for a collaborative repair effort. While investigation and repair efforts are underway, Bayobab’s strategy focuses on successfully rerouting traffic, leveraging our extensive network, and collaborating with industry partners,” the telco said.

“Our network resiliency allows for the swift activation of new cables, facilitating faster rerouting and bolstering network resilience. By activating new cables, we quickly increase interconnectivity and establish alternative routes.

“Additionally, we are working with the cable consortiums and partners to enhance interconnection along both the west and east coasts, with further interconnections between WACS and Equiano, and the introduction of the end-to-end connection between WACS on the west coast and EASSy on the east coast.”

MTN said it has already made progress in restoring service in some affected regions, assuring it remains committed to achieving full recovery as swiftly as possible.","The article titled 'Internet disruption: Undersea cable repair might take two weeks, says MainOne' discusses the recent cuts to undersea cables, specifically stating that four subsea cables were cut, which disrupted internet services in major parts of West Africa.

Johannesburg, 08 Aug 2023

The WACS and SAT-3 undersea cables snapped simultaneously.

South African fibre infrastructure providers are taking action to resolve disruptions in internet connectivity services, following a break in two undersea cables this week.

The West Africa Cable System (WACS) and SAT-3 undersea cables snapped simultaneously on Sunday, impacting local fibre players, infrastructure provider Openserve and Broadband Infraco, among others.

In a statement, Openserve says the impact on its network is limited to customers on the international private leased circuit services.

“Openserve can confirm the breaks of the WACS and SAT-3 undersea cables. We are collaborating with the consortium partners to facilitate the restoration of these cables.

“The Openserve network remains robust due to our investment in other international cable capacity, hence all Openserve IP Transit services traffic has been automatically re-routed, ensuring our customers stay seamlessly connected.”

According to Openserve, no official restoration timeline has been communicated by the consortium.

In a tweet, state-owned wholesale infrastructure provider Broadband Infraco apologized to customers for the connectivity interruptions caused by the cable issues.

“A WACS cable break has occurred in the subsea nearby DRC Congo Canyon. The break is confirmed at approximately 3 686km from Yzerfontein cable landing station. For more info, please contact +2711 239 8020 or opssupport@infraco.co.za,” says the company in the tweet.

The WACS and SAT-3 cable systems are deployed in the Atlantic Ocean, and connect SA and many other African countries to Europe.

The WACS system lands in SA at Yzerfontein, Western Cape, while the SAT-3/WACS system enters the country at Melkbosstrand, Western Cape.

The WACS cable consists of four fibre pairs and is 14 530km in length, linking from Yzerfontein in the Western Cape of SA, to London in the UK.

Operators of the WACS and SAT-3 had not responded to ITWeb’s queries by the time of publication.","The article provides a comprehensive discussion on the breaking of the WACS and SAT-3 undersea cables, detailing the impact on internet connectivity in South Africa.

**Published Date:** 05/13/2024  
**Author:** David Belson  
  
On Sunday, May 12, issues with the EASSy and Seacom submarine cables again disrupted connectivity to East Africa, impacting a number of countries previously affected by a set of cable cuts that occurred nearly three months earlier.  
  
On February 24, three submarine cables that run through the Red Sea were damaged: the Seacom/Tata cable, the Asia Africa Europe-1 (AAE-1), and the Europe India Gateway (EIG). It is believed that the cables were cut by the anchor of the Rubymar, a cargo ship that was damaged by a ballistic missile on February 18. These cable cuts reportedly impacted countries in East Africa, including Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and Mozambique. As of this writing (May 13), these cables remain unrepaired.  
  
Already suffering from reduced capacity due to the February cable cuts, these countries were impacted by a second set of cable cuts that occurred on Sunday, May 12. According to a social media post from Ben Roberts, Group CTIO at Liquid Intelligent Technologies in Kenya, faults on the EASSy and Seacom cables again disrupted connectivity to East Africa. A BBC article citing Roberts stated that the EASSy cable had been cut approximately 45km (28 miles) north of the South African port city of Durban.  
  
Cloudflare Radar saw traffic levels across a number of the impacted countries drop just before 11:00 local time (08:00 UTC). The magnitude of impact varied by country, with traffic initially dropping by 10-25% in Kenya, Uganda, Madagascar, and Mozambique, while traffic in Rwanda, Malawi, and Tanzania dropped by one-third or more.  
  
In Kenya, the impact may have been nominal due to steps taken by providers like Safaricom and Airtel Kenya. Safaricom noted that they activated redundancy measures to minimize service interruption. Similarly, the Communications Authority of Kenya talked about actions being taken to secure alternative routes for their traffic.  
  
Once the necessary permits are secured and the cable faults are located, repairs can often be completed in several days. However, cable repair ships are something of a scarce resource, leading to delays. The Cloudflare Radar team will continue to monitor traffic recovery and the status of Internet connectivity in the impacted countries.","The article titled ""East African Internet connectivity again impacted by submarine cable cuts"" discusses multiple incidents involving submarine cable cuts that have affected internet connectivity in East Africa.

**Published Date:** February 13, 2023  
**Author:** Paul Lipscombe  

Two of China's biggest mobile operators have reportedly withdrawn their involvement in the South East Asia-Middle East-West Europe 6 (SeaMeWe-6) submarine cable project.  
According to The Financial Times, China Mobile and China Telecom pulled out of the project last year amid rising geopolitical tensions with the US.  

The 19,200km cable was first announced last year, and is set to link Singapore to Marseille, France, passing Italy, Greece, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Djibouti, Pakistan, India, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Malaysia.  
But growing tensions between the US and China over control over the infrastructure have led the two Chinese operators to pull out.  

The reason for China's withdrawal is reportedly due to US company SubCom being awarded a contract to build the cable, rather than Hengtong Marine, China's biggest fiber cable provider in the sector, noted the FT, citing three sources. Hengtong in 2019 acquired a majority stake in Huawei Marine Networks, after US sanctions forced a sale.  

It's a blow for the project, which isn't due to go live until 2025, with the two operators combining to invest 20 percent into the project, with the overall cable set to cost $500 million.  
Set for 2025, the SeaMeWe-6 cable is backed by a consortium including Microsoft, Orange, Telecom Egypt, Telekom Malaysia, Airtel, and -until now - all three of China's mobile operators. The other Chinese operator, Unicom, is still said to be involved with the project.  

One member of the consortium described China Mobile and China Telecom's involvement in the project as ""important but not critical.""  

**China vs US... again**  
It's no secret geopolitical tensions have escalated between China and the US in recent years.  
In 2021, a subsea cable set to connect the Pacific Island nations was scrapped after the US government warned that Chinese companies pose a security threat.  
At the time, the World Bank-led project declined to award a contract for the East Micronesia Cable rather than let it go to Chinese cable company HMN (Huawei Marine Networks) Technologies.  

Meanwhile, Facebook (now Meta) pulled out from the HKA project to build a submarine cable between California, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, as the US technology company felt pressure from the US.  

Scrutiny around Hong Kong has increased as the Chinese government steadily erodes the region's autonomy, and enacts increasingly restrictive surveillance and data laws, which has threatened the numerous tech companies that have opened data centers and offered services in the region.  

In 2020, the White House set up 'Team Telecom' to evaluate foreign participation in US telecom networks. In June 2020, the team recommended that the FCC deny the 11,800km Pacific Light Cable Network cable extension to Hong Kong, the first direct US-Hong Kong cable.  

In 2021, the Department of Justice group recommended approving a Google and Meta/Facebook cable between the US and Asia, but without links to Hong Kong.  

Another point of concern was that, when the cable was first announced in 2016, the largest backer of the cable was Chinese-based Pacific Light Data Communications Co.  

After some discussions, Google and Meta agreed that the PLDC will have restricted access to the infrastructure and information, and leave the Hong Kong section of the cable unused.  

**And some more times when China and the US have clashed...**  
This political battle has extended to chipsets too, with Japan and the Netherlands recently agreeing with the US on wide-ranging restrictions on exporting high-tech chipmaking machinery to China.  

Telecoms equipment makers Huawei and ZTE were also added to Commerce Department and Federal Communications Commission lists that bans these firms from selling new equipment in the US, and bans US firms from selling to them.  

Meanwhile, China Telecom is also banned from operating in the US after the decision was upheld in December of last year. The FCC argued that the operator ""is subject to exploitation, influence, and control by the Chinese government.""  

Most recently there's been scrutiny around the alleged Chinese spy balloons (and other flying objects) that have been spotted in the Americas, which the US government says can intercept and geolocate communications.  

The balloon was shot down over the Atlantic this month. The Chinese government has maintained that the airship was simply a wayward weather balloon.  

One senior State Department official claimed that the balloon was equipped with multiple antennas capable of ""intelligence collection operations,"" and featured ""multiple active intelligence collection sensors"" as well as sensors for geolocating communications.","The article discusses the withdrawal of China Mobile and China Telecom from the SeaMeWe-6 submarine cable project, citing geopolitical tensions with the US.

However, a police officer said attacks by Islamist militants had dropped during the outage that lasted more than three weeks.

“The internet is now back and clients are using it,” said Adnan Ali, the media director for Hormuud Telecom, the country’s top operator.

Businesses had to close or improvise to remain open during the shutdown and the telecoms minister told state radio it cost the equivalent of about $10 million in daily economic output.

Information Minister Abdirahman Omar Osman apologized to citizens on Tuesday for the outage, which hit all landline and mobile users apart from those with access to private satellite connections, and called for them to have back-up plans.

“We urge internet companies to have a backup so that people do not suffer another outage in the future,” he told Reuters.

Al Shabaab wants to topple the Western-backed government and rule the country according to its strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law.

Nur Bile, a police officer, said the number of reported attacks by al Shabaab had dropped during the outage, accusing the group of using the web to publicize its attacks and spread its ideology.

“There were almost no blasts in Mogadishu during the outage. Al Shabaab launches the attacks and the media spreads the news on the internet,” Bile said.

The loss of internet service sparked anger across Somalia and affected the central and southern parts of the country including the capital, Mogadishu.

HARGEISA – Somalia’s internet has returned after an outage of more than three weeks cost the Horn of Africa nation about $10 million a day, authorities said Monday.

Hormuud Telecom, the country’s largest telecom company, announced the restoration of service in a message to subscribers.

The loss of internet service sparked anger across Somalia and affected the central and southern parts of the country including the capital, Mogadishu. The government called it a “major disaster.”

Officials and internet providers attributed the problem to a commercial ship that they said cut an undersea cable.

Major companies reported millions of dollars in revenue losses. University studies were disrupted.

The internet outage also complicated efforts to combat a nationwide drought that has half of the country’s 12 million people in need of assistance.

Residents in the capital celebrated the return of service. “This helps a lot,” Abdirashid Duale, the CEO of the largest international Somali remittance company, Dahabshiil, told a news agency. While the company had a backup satellite internet service in place, “the internet outage has affected many of our customers.”

The lack of internet service also stranded patients who were seeking medical attention abroad as they couldn’t access online paperwork.

“The internet outage had my father stuck in Mogadishu. Now we can take him to India having received all medical paperwork via internet,” said Nur Hussein.

Somalia is trying to emerge from a quarter-century of conflict. The fragile central government remains a target for the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab extremist group, which often carries out deadly attacks in the capital.

Across the Internet measurement community today, we’ve been watching the outages that are unfortunately happening across much of western and southern Africa. The outages are very clear and substantial in reports from [Cloudflare Radar](https://radar.cloudflare.com/outage-center) and the [Internet Outage Detection and Analysis](https://ioda.inetintel.cc.gatech.edu/dashboard/?from=1710340628&until=1710427028) (IODA), as the screenshots below indicate.

[Cloudflare has published a blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/undersea-cable-failures-cause-internet-disruptions-across-africa-march-14-2024) on more of what they have seen so far.

The general understanding at this time is that the outages relate to reduced capacity within the subsea cables connecting these regions of Africa to the rest of the global Internet.

Earlier today network operator [Vodacom posted on X](https://twitter.com/Vodacom/status/1768262584413679758) that an undersea cable was to blame. [MTN Nigeria posted a similar message,](https://twitter.com/MTN180/status/1768280785084137753) as did other Internet and telecom providers in the region.

[Microsoft Azure’s status site stated](https://web.archive.org/web/20240314160638/https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status) which undersea cables Microsoft had been able to determine were having issues:

> We have determined that multiple fiber cables on the West Coast of Africa — WACS, MainOne, SAT3, ACE — have been impacted which reduced total capacity supporting our Regions in South Africa.
> 
> In addition to these cable impacts, the on-going cable cuts in the Red Sea — EIG, Seacom, AAE-1 — are also impacting capacity on the East Coast of Africa.
> 
> This combination of incidents has impacted all Africa capacity – including other Cloud providers and public Internet as well.

A Cable Cut? Or Capacity Issues? Or Misconfiguration?
-----------------------------------------------------

The challenge we all have right now is not having enough information to understand what is happening here.

Were there cuts to more cables (possibly by an [undersea rock slide](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7174052814636126209?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop))? Or were there configuration issues? We need transparency from the cable and network operators so that we all can understand what is going on.

Of the 12 countries reportedly affected by the outage, the majority seem to have restored Internet traffic volume to levels seen the previous 24 hours, according to Cloudflare Radar.

Although Cloudflare Radar is still reporting an outage for South Africa the effects have not been as great as other countries, which can possibly be credited to their [greater overall Internet resilience](https://pulse.internetsociety.org/resilience) and greater number of subsea cables (n=9).

Ghana seems to be still the worst effected country from the outage with traffic trends more than a third of what they were 24 hours earlier.

Côte d’Ivoire, Senegal, Nigeria and Ghana are among the worst-affected, although internet users as far away as South Africa have also been hit.

The incident coincides with a spate of apparent sabotage incidents affecting cables on the opposite side of the continent. Yemen-based Houthi rebels are suspected of severing undersea fibre-optic cables in the Red Sea late last month, affecting internet traffic between East Africa, Asia and Europe. 

The cause of the damage to the West African cables has not been confirmed. Several different cables are affected, including the West Africa Cable System (WACS), the Africa Coast to Europe (ACE), MainOne, and SAT3.

MainOne, a Nigerian telecom services and network solutions firm, said in a statement that the disruption was “most probably due to environmental factors such as landslides and earthquakes”. It claimed that it could rule out any kind of “human activity” as a cause of the fault, since at the point at which the damage occurred the cable lies 3km deep on the seabed.

Economic impacts from the outage are likely to be considerable. Banks were forced to close in several countries, including Nigeria, as they were unable to process transactions. Mobile internet users across the region have also reported slow connection speeds, with knock-on impacts for mobile money providers.

Preliminary estimates suggest that fully repairing the damage will take around five weeks, taking into account the two weeks needed for repair vessels to reach the area where the cables have been severed.

Fragile cables leave Africa vulnerable
Undersea telecommunication cables play a critical role in the global economy. Improvements in fibre-optic cable connections across Africa over the last decade have helped internet-based businesses flourish, enabling the growth of tech ecosystems in many countries.

However, these connections are extremely fragile and damage to cables is relatively common. As well as deliberate sabotage, cables can be severed by undersea earthquakes, landslides or volcanic eruptions. Ships dragging their anchors along the seabed are another common culprit for faults. Even shark bites can cause serious damage.

To varying degrees, African countries are particularly vulnerable due to the relatively low density of cable connections to many countries. Several major cable systems extend around large sections of the African continent – for example Google’s Equiano cable, which runs from Portugal to South Africa and was completed in 2022 – but most of these systems have spurs that create “landing points” in only a handful of countries.

Sierra Leone, Liberia and Mauritania, for example, are each connected by a single cable, meaning that any damage can cause a total internet blackout. South Africa, on the other hand, has multiple connections, so that telecom operators can reroute traffic onto other cables in the event of an outage.

Telecoms operator MTN said in a statement that it was making progress in restoring services in West Africa and, in the longer term, is seeking to improve the resilience of its networks.

An alternative to fibre-optic cables is to use satellites to deliver internet services. Satellite internet, however, generally delivers slower connections at great expense. Efforts to scale up this technology are still nascent. Elon Musk’s Starlink internet service, for example, is currently available in only a handful of African countries, including Eswatini, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda and Zambia.","The article titled ""Severed internet cables highlight Africa’s vulnerability"" directly discusses the damage to several undersea fibre-optic cables affecting internet connectivity in West Africa.

"Microsoft and Facebook's Record-Breaking Atlantic Cable","160 terabits per second capacity with implications for connectivity disruptions during events like Hurricane Sandy.","https://www.extremetech.com/computing/256394-microsoft-facebook-160-terabits-per-second-cable-atlantic","2017-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","",Yes,"Frank Rey","New York City, NY, USA",-,"2017-09-26","English","ExtremeTech","Microsoft, Facebook, and Telxius have finished their joint effort to run a massive bandwidth pipe 4,100 miles across the Atlantic Ocean. The new cable can transmit 160 terabits per second (20TBps). That's rather a lot. The Marea cable is 17,000 feet below the surface of the ocean, at pressures that would crush the human body like a beer can.

The cable connects Virginia to Spain, from its starting point at Virginia Beach to Bilbao. The Marea is just one of the many cables that link the United States to the rest of the world, but it's now the fastest cable -- and it doesn't follow the same route as previous cables did. That's a deliberate choice that Microsoft made to limit the potential damage if one or more of the cables on the 'main' route was broken. These kind of breakages do happen, typically by accident, and they can leave significant parts of a country with either no Internet at all, or a very limited pipeline. The United States is arguably at less risk of being disrupted than some other countries, thanks to a plethora of connections and the fact that many domains and services are hosted domestically, rather than being accessed remotely, but we'd still feel the effects of any significant disruption. The Marea cable is partly meant to guard against that problem.

The impetus for the cable project was Hurricane Sandy, which hit the East Coast back in 2012. The storm and its associated storm surge did significant damage to computer networks, cell phone towers, and other infrastructure, particularly in New Jersey and New York City.

“It was a major disruption,” says Frank Rey, director of global network strategy for Microsoft’s Cloud Infrastructure and Operations division. “The entire network between North America and Europe was isolated for a number of hours. For us, the storm brought to light a potential challenge in the consolidation of transatlantic cables that all landed in New York and New Jersey.”

According to Brad Smith, president of Microsoft, the cable was also deployed to meet the growing need for bandwidth between the United States, Europe, and Africa. Cables between the US and Europe already carry 55 percent more traffic than US-Pacific links, and 40 percent more traffic than the links between the US and Latin America.

Microsoft notes the cable is over 4,000 miles long, weighs 10.25 million pounds, and is the approximate weight of 34 blue whales. On the one hand, the blue whale is the heaviest and largest animal alive today, and may be the heaviest and largest animal to have lived. On the other, it's really odd to measure things with whales. Then again, we measure lots of things with Rhode Island, for reasons that have never been entirely clear.

Fun fact: According to Randall Munroe, a 747 at full thrust is powerful enough to balance the weight of a single blue whale. If a 747 can balance a blue whale, and Microsoft's Marea cable weighs as much as 34 blue whales, how many blue whales does it take to cover and/or sink Rhode Island? The answer would require calculating how much isostatic depression each whale would create per foot and how much weight it would take to sink the state. Topographic maps are probably a must. Bonus points for calculating Rhode Island's average height above sea level during the last ice age, when billions of tons of ice depressed continents all around the world.","The article discusses the Marea undersea cable and its implications for internet connectivity, particularly in relation to potential disruptions caused by cable breakages.

It highlights how such disruptions can lead to significant connectivity issues, as seen during Hurricane Sandy.

While it does not directly mention 'cut sea cables,' it engages with the topic through its discussion of undersea cables and their importance.

**Author:** Samuel Mungadze  
**Published Date:** 02/26/2024  

Telecoms provider SEACOM suffered an outage on its subsea cable system over the weekend.  

The disruption is affecting the segment of the cable that runs from Mombasa (Kenya) to Zafarana (Egypt), SEACOM said in a statement.  

According to the company, although the outage has impacted some of its clients’ businesses across East and Southern Africa, SEACOM has “been working diligently to ensure the continuity of its services”.  

Initial assessments suggest that the disruption to the subsea cable occurred within the vicinity of the Red Sea, and other cables in the area also appear to have been impacted.  

The company said it was unable to confirm the cause of the disruption but was working to assess the feasibility of the repair in the region.  

“The location of the cable break is significant due to its geopolitical sensitivity and ongoing tensions, making it a challenging environment for maintenance and repair operations,” said the company.  

Nonetheless, SEACOM says it continues to carry traffic on its own cable between Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and South Africa, for both transmission and IP services.  

The statement reads: “All other IP-based services destined for Europe and other regions were automatically rerouted via SEACOM’s alternative routes on Equiano, PEACE and WACS cable systems and supported by its diverse terrestrial infrastructure, ensuring its clients remain operational with some latency in their internet communications.”  

SEACOM says it provided customers with a cautionary alert on 5 February that any disruptions to the cable system could be impacted by delays in repair operations, due to the instability of the area.  

“The team is currently working towards restoration timelines and will communicate these plans with our clients,” said the company.","The article discusses a significant outage of SEACOM's subsea cable system, specifically affecting the segment between Kenya and Egypt.

Lebanon has one of the slowest internet connections in the world - and it's really hurting business.

In March this year web users in Lebanon were shocked to learn the internet speed in their country ranked rock bottom in the world.  
It came in placed 186th - behind Zambia, Vanuatu and even war-ravaged countries like Iraq and Afghanistan.

The data, published by speedtest.net, spurred the country's online activists into action.  
Campaign groups like Ontornet ('Ontor' a play on the Arabic for 'wait') and Flip the Switch sprang up on Facebook, while Twitter became awash with real-time feedback on people's web experiences.

""A file that takes me 16 hrs to download in Lebanon is downloaded in 6 minutes in France!"" wrote @Joanna_2983.  
Another, @Lebanese_facts, quipped: ""Loading…loading…loading… *15 mins later* page failed to load.""

And @Doreen_Khoury wrote: ""If you live in Lebanon never go on vacation longer than a week; you get used to 24 hour electricity and fast internet.""

Online protests have gained widespread support from household consumers all the way up to big businesses.

Sensing growing unrest, the Telecoms Minister Nicolas Sehnaoui took action pushing through a decree in September committing to increase the country's internet speeds by up to eight times - while reducing costs by more than two-thirds.

According to the government, this will be achieved by connecting to the high capacity fibre optic India-Middle East-Western Europe (IMEWE) submarine cable.

The IMEWE cable had been available for use from December 2010, but had not been switched on because of a dispute between the Telecoms Ministry and Ogero, the government-owned telecoms company responsible for the cable's maintenance.

**Investor fear**  
Imad Taraby is the chairman and chief executive of the data service provider Cedarcom, a company that buys internet bandwidth from the Telecoms Ministry and then sells it onto consumers.

He says preferential treatment of government-owned suppliers is the real cause of Lebanon's slow internet.  
""Investors fear investing into this sector,"" says Mr Taraby.  
""Why? Because we have one-year licences and competition is unfair. We pay so much high taxes up to 59% while government operators don't pay any tax and that doesn't allow [us] to compete fairly, by default, sooner or later and I'm talking within three to six months there's a very high risk that private operators exit the market and that will instate more and more monopoly.

""You need a private sector. All the innovation comes from the private sector.""

So in a country that aspires to be the 'Silicon Valley' of the Middle East, how does Lebanon's slow internet affect tech-based businesses?  
Mark Daou works in advertising and PR, and also runs the Fast Lebanon Facebook campaign group.  
""Basically it's waiting, waiting, waiting and if you're still not bored you wait a little bit more,"" he says.  
""We've got large files that we upload to offices outside of Lebanon. We usually do that on Saturday nights and on Sundays during the day because that is the time when the least people are using the internet.""

""It's the best way to make sure you don't get cut off when you are uploading a 200MB file and have to start over again.""

For Mr Daou, the decree doesn't go far enough.  
""There's still a cap on the amount of internet usage you can use and it's ridiculously low. What we're looking for is a big master plan. Something that would really say Lebanon sees the internet as a human right for every individual in Lebanon to stay educated, to stay up to date, to be able to progress and to have a fair chance in this life.""

However, for other businesses the internet's biggest drawback is its cost.  
Samer Karam is the director of Seeqnce, a start-up accelerator which helps small web companies by sharing knowledge and aggregating office facilities.  
""From what I've seen the creative industry, in its creativity, hasn't been stifled,"" says Mr Karam.  
""However, due to the very high prices they have been unable to produce content at the speed and capacity that they are capable of and publish it online and even if they were able to, their consumers wouldn't be able to consume it.""

""So, effectively a place like Seeqnce, where there is a lot of creativity, we end up paying roughly $1,200 (£765) a month for a one megabit connection which is absurd.  
It's roughly 100 times more than what you would pay in a developed country.""

But Mr Karam is optimistic about the future.  
""What we anticipate to happen, if this industry were to be opened up and the connections were to get bigger, is we could potentially return to our former glory as the Paris of the Middle East.  
The East would meet the West halfway in Beirut, and the cultures of the East could take a step closer to the West.""

Since the issuing of the government's decree, social media sites have been abuzz with speculation about when the internet will speed up.  
Speaking shortly after the decree's passing, Firas Abi-Nassif, the adviser to the telecoms minister, explained what the public could expect.  
""It's still obviously not at par with modern or developed countries' types of internet speeds,"" he said.  
""This is just the first step before we get to much faster, much more powerful internet through the fibre network which, as we speak, is being deployed in the country.""

This week the country's The Daily Star newspaper published research that found that of 550 people surveyed, 68% said their internet connection was ""slow and nothing had changed"" since the beginning of October, the month the government said that faster speeds would be passed onto consumers.  
According to Mr Abi-Nassif speeds will pick up as the country moves toward a full 3G wireless internet service by early November. Something to celebrate perhaps, were it not for the fact that Japan introduced the same technology a decade ago.","The article discusses the IMEWE submarine cable, which is directly related to the topic of cut sea cables.

HARGEISA, Somalia (AP) — Somalia’s internet has returned after an outage of more than three weeks cost the Horn of Africa nation about $10 million a day, authorities said Monday.

Hormuud Telecom, the country’s largest telecom company, announced the restoration of service in a message to subscribers.

The loss of internet service sparked anger across Somalia and affected the central and southern parts of the country including the capital, Mogadishu. The government called it a “major disaster.”

Officials and internet providers attributed the problem to a commercial ship that they said cut an undersea cable.

Major companies reported millions of dollars in revenue losses. University studies were disrupted.

The internet outage also complicated efforts to combat a nationwide drought that has half of the country’s 12 million people in need of assistance.

Residents in the capital celebrated the return of service. “This helps a lot,” Abdirashid Duale, the CEO of the largest international Somali remittance company, Dahabshiil, told The Associated Press. While the company had a backup satellite internet service in place, “the internet outage has affected many of our customers.”

The lack of internet service also stranded patients who were seeking medical attention abroad as they couldn’t access online paperwork.

“The internet outage had my father stuck in Mogadishu. Now we can take him to India having received all medical paperwork via internet,” said Nur Hussein.

Somalia is trying to emerge from a quarter-century of conflict. The fragile central government remains a target for the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab extremist group, which often carries out deadly attacks in the capital.","The article discusses a significant internet outage in Somalia caused by a commercial ship cutting an undersea cable.

Prenesh Padayachee, Seacom group chief digital officer, was more forthcoming with information and took the opportunity to give an update on the Red Sea situation.

### What are the effects of the recent cable breakages on Seacom clients?

Our clients are fortunate to have built-in redundancy. Their IP traffic is automatically rerouted, meaning the break is mostly transparent to the end-user barring a potential slight increase in latency.

### How does the company manage to stay ahead of competing service providers?

We invest in infrastructure upfront and were the first to go live on Equiano cable and actively participate in new cable projects like. The company also builds in multiple redundancy layers, both for the subsea network and within national terrestrial networks.

### Can you offer guarantees to clients during disruptions, especially as redundancy is now more strained and prices rise?

We are fortunate to not need to manually reconfigure its network, as traffic automatically reroutes to the next available path. This is a key differentiator. While some providers – specifically the high bandwidth hyperscalers – with capacity mapped to specific cables see performance suffer, we maintains reliable service for clients. We saw this happen with the Microsoft clients who couldn’t access teams.

### What are the contingency plans employed when routing is disrupted?

The main principle is upfront investment in multiple cable systems and terrestrial redundancy. We use dual routing for traffic that needs to head to Eastern or Western Europe and use the geographically appropriate cable to follow the shortest possible routes and optimise use around load shedding schedules (in South Africa specifically) to further protect their network.

### Do you have any advice for businesses choosing ISPs to mitigate these kinds of outages?

If the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Look at a potential ISP's infrastructure and ask:  
• Who provides their international capacity?  
• Which cable networks do they have access to?  
• Does traffic automatically reroute in case of an outage?

Padayachee also explained that, while this is one of the worst disruptions he has seen, he was joking with colleagues that they have seen this movie before.

Regarding the Red Sea outage, the suspicion is anchor drag damage and not vandalism that has been reported – and he could see the same issues happening on the west coast of the continent.

Red Sea repair teams are still getting permits in an increasingly fluid geopolitical zone.

"Major Internet Outages in South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Liberia, and Ivory Coast","Severe internet disruptions impacting five countries due to undersea cable damage; includes expert analysis on cable damage causes.","https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68569022","2024-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","",Yes,"Natasha Booty & Moses Kollie Garzeawu",-,"609714","2024-03-15","English","BBC News","**Major internet disruption has been reported in various countries across Africa.**

Widespread outages were reported on Thursday in countries including South Africa, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Benin, Ghana and Burkina Faso.

Since then, services have largely been restored in Liberia and South Africa.

The cause of the cable failures was not immediately clear, to the frustration of millions of customers around the continent.

""There seems to be a pattern in the timing of the disruptions, impacting from the north to the south of Africa,"" said Cloudflare Radar, which provides information on internet connections.

The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), which regulates the telecoms industry, said the outage was caused by damage to international undersea cables running along the West African coastline.

""The cuts occurred somewhere in Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal, with an attendant disruption in Portugal,"" said NCC spokesman Reuben Muoka.

Sometimes undersea cables can get cut, even by debris, a retired expert told the BBC.

He added: ""You can also have undersea earth slides - sections of seabed can become unstable, sending huge amounts of mud down a canyon or gulley.""

""Where cables come ashore and are buried underground, they could be prone to accidental or intentional damage.""

Whatever the cause, it has resulted in major difficulties for people who rely on the internet for a living.

""It's been impossible to communicate with my clients - I also needed to organise a delivery though an online app,"" fashion designer Cheick Senou told the BBC on Friday from Abidjan in Ivory Coast.

""I couldn't do anything without the internet.""

Internet connectivity in the Ivory Coast was down to around just 4% on Thursday morning, according to Netblocks, which tracks cybersecurity and internet connectivity.

Liberia at one point dropped to 17% while Benin was at 14% and Ghana 25%, Netblocks said.

In South Africa, Vodacom on Thursday said that customers were ""experiencing intermittent connectivity issues due to multiple undersea cable failures"".

A fault was also reported on the MainOne cable system which serves Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos.

The Liberian government confirmed on Thursday that internet disruption had been reported from that morning.

Citizens were unable to access the basic internet as well as social media across the vast majority of the country. International bank transfers were also reported to be affected while there were limited international voice calls.

""It seems like 50% of my life is gone today,"" Benjamin Garkpah told the BBC from the Liberian capital, Monrovia, on Thursday.

Fatumata Barry said her business had stalled because she couldn't receive payments through mobile money.

The Liberia Telecommunications Authority said it was caused by an incident involving the Africa Coast to Europe (ACE) submarine communications cable in Ivory Coast.

In Ghana, the National Communications Authority (NCA) reported that multiple undersea cable disruptions were responsible for the outage.

"Facebook's 55-Terabit Submarine Cable Investment in Asia","55-terabit capacity aimed at improving Southeast Asia's internet connectivity; addresses redundancy to mitigate impacts of cable cuts.","https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/132406-facebook-invests-in-55-terabit-intra-asia-submarine-cable","2012-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","",Yes,-,"New York, New York, United States","20000","2012-07-06","English","ExtremeTech","Facebook has joined a consortium that will build by far the fastest intra-Asia submarine fiber optic network, the Asia Pacific Gateway (APG). Facebook is the only American company involved with the venture, which will see 10,000km (6,000 miles) of prime fiber laid between Malaysia and Japan, with branches landing in almost every country along the way (Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, China, Taiwan, and South Korea).

When the cable goes online in 2014, it is slated to use 40Gbps channels, for a total capacity of 55 terabits per second, or a transfer speed of 6.9 terabytes (138 Blu-ray discs) per second. When the various routers and repeaters are upgraded to 100Gbps-per-channel, the cable will have a total capacity of well over 100Tbps. The members of the consortium have put forward a total of $450 million so far, which makes it one of the most expensive submarine cable systems in the world.

The prime reason for building the cable, other than making money, is to provide more redundancy between the US and Asia. Currently, almost every connection from Asia to the US is routed through Singapore or Japan. If there is congestion at one of these sites, or a cable is cut, then the other (highly populous) countries in south east Asia are in trouble. It is perhaps no surprise that China Telecom and China Unicom, two of the world's largest telecoms companies, are involved in the laying of APG. Time dotCom, another member of the APG consortium, says that the new cable will reduce latency between the US and Asia -- which is fairly important, considering how many internet services are based in the US.

Beyond redundancy, this cable (and Facebook's involvement) is significant for one very important reason: Over the next few years, almost all of the internet's growth will occur in Asia. The total number of internet users has almost stagnated in Europe and North America -- while in China, India, and south east Asia, hundreds of millions of people are connecting to the internet every year. Facebook has almost reached saturation point in Europe and North America, while its growth in Asia is only just starting to kick in. Backing this cable is Facebook's way of acknowledging that Asian users are important to the continued growth of the social network -- and, of course, the company is also communicating to its shareholders that its flagging US and EU growth isn't a cause for concern.

While it seems quite sensible, it's actually quite uncommon for web-based companies to invest in infrastructure beyond their own data centers. Google is one of the few exceptions, owning large swathes of the internet's backbone, and being a member of the consortium that laid the Japan-US Unity submarine cable system. By owning a large portion of the network between its servers and its users, and thus control of the network setup and topology, it can provide much faster (lower-latency) access to its services. Being the most popular destination on the web, I wouldn't be surprised if this marks the beginning of significant infrastructure investment by Facebook.","The article discusses the investment in a submarine cable system and mentions the implications of cable cuts, such as the potential impact on internet connectivity for Southeast Asian countries.

Wacs and the other cables – Sat-3, Ace and MainOne – were cut in a suspected subsea seismic event near Ivory Coast on 14 March, causing internet chaos across the region, including as far south as South Africa.

Much of the traffic was, however, quickly rerouted along other cables, including Google’s recently launched Equiano system between Cape Town and Europe and the Sacs cable, which carries traffic from Angola across the Atlantic Ocean to Latin America and on to the US.

A spokesman for Openserve, Telkom’s wholesale networks subsidiary and an investor in both Sat-3 and Wacs, told TechCentral that repairs to Wacs are expected to be completed on Tuesday. Internet traffic should start flowing across the system soon thereafter.

This follows the repair of the older and lower-capacity Sat-3 cable system, which was repaired and came back into service on 7 April, Openserve confirmed to TechCentral. Wiocc, an investor in the Ace cable, confirmed that the Ace system has also been repaired and is again operational.

The repairs have taken some time as repair ships had to set sail from thousands of kilometres away to attend to the severed cables. The repair process involves lifting the cables off the ocean floor, making repairs on board the ship and then lowering the cables carefully back down to the ocean floor.

Seismic events are a common cause of cable faults along Africa’s west coast, with previous disruptions occurring in the deep Congo Canyon off the coast of the Democratic Republic of Congo. In other parts of the world, such as in the busy Red Sea shipping corridor, cable cuts are often the result of ships dropping anchor on them.

### Repair process

The status of the MainOne cable repair could not immediately be ascertained.

The CS Sovereign, a cable repair ship that repaired the Ace and Wacs cables has also reportedly been assigned to the MainOne cable repair. Ship-tracking website marinetraffic.com shows the UK-registered vessel was stationed offshore near Ivory Coast at the time of writing.

The telecommunications giant reiterated that “this approach solidifies our commitment to prioritising network reliability and our dedication to connecting Africa and our customers as quickly as possible marking the final stretch toward connecting all our valued customers.”

###### **Background**

All mobile and fixed data services went down nationwide in the early hours of Thursday, March 14.

The internet disruption brought several activities to a halt, with mobile network operators (MNOs) running on minimal data capacity.

According to the National Communications Authority, Ghana lost about 1,596.6 Gbps of data capacity owing to multiple undersea cable cuts.

However, MTN Ghana announced on March 18 that it had secured additional network capacity from its international partners, resulting in an improvement in data connectivity.

MTN Ghana promised its clients that it was examining all possibilities to alleviate the data difficulties they were facing.

###### **Ghana needs a robust contingency plan**

Meanwhile, the Executive Director of the Centre for Maritime Law and Security, Dr. Kamal-Deen Ali, has emphasised the importance of the country having a robust plan to reduce its over-reliance on submarine cables for data transfer.

In an interview with Alfred Ocansey, host of TV3’s **Ghana Tonight** programme on Friday, March 15, Dr. Kamal-Deen Ali stated that there must be “thorough discussions on the disruptions” that can happen to submarine cables to inform future action.

He noted that “disruptions such as this do happen from time to time,” stressing that “as a country, we must have [a very robust contingency plan](https://3news.com/news/undersea-cable-cut-we-need-a-robust-contingency-plan-dr-ali/) to deal with such disruptions when they happen.”

“The submarine cable fault was in a known area of ridges in the seabed, at a location 3400 meters water depth in the international waters outside Senegal. After we discovered the outage and isolated the fault to a location 3000km South of Portugal, our operational processes and disaster recovery plans worked as expected and we deployed a repair vessel from our membership in the Atlantic Cable and Maintenance Agreement which left France by 8am on Monday June 19th 2017. The vessel travelled to Portland, United Kingdom, where it picked up critical spares and then journeyed to the repair location which was further isolated to within a 2 kilometer range while the vessel was in transit. We have concluded a full repair of the submarine cable with a final splice yesterday, Sunday July 2, 2017. The cable has been tested to be in good operating condition and we have since restored all our customer’s services to normal operating conditions”, she said.  
  
She continued “During this period, we had some restoration capacity and rerouted internet traffic on our network via alternative routes to minimize the impact of the outage to our customers. However, we were unable to provide enough capacity and interconnection to fully restore our entire network. We realize many of our customers have become solely reliant on MainOne for Internet services and we will continue to secure more restoration capacity in case of any such eventualities in the future”.  
  
While thanking its customers and partners for their cooperation and support during this outage, the company reiterated its commitment to transforming West Africa from a resource-based economy to a fully digitized, knowledge-based economy.

Local publication Matangi Tonga Online reported that the service was back up and running on Wednesday (July 12).

The damage to the cable was caused when a large underwater volcano erupted close to Tonga in January 2022, triggering tsunamis reaching heights of almost three feet in places.

Both the international Tonga Cable – laid in 2013 and running 827km to Fiji – and the Tonga Domestic Cable connecting the islands of Vavaʻu, Lifuka, and Tongatapu were damaged. The island nation’s international cable was repaired a month after the eruption.

In total, the amount of cable used in reconnecting the cable system was just over 108km, according to Tonga Cable Limited (TCL), which had to wait for the replacement cable to arrive from France.

The lengthy wait was somewhat expected, with DCD reporting last year that if a local replacement can’t be sourced, it could take a year to repair.

""The reason it has taken so long to get the domestic cable repaired is due to the lack of the required amount and type of cable to carry out the repair job. It took five months to confirm the amount of cable to order from Alcatel Submarine Networks (ASN),"" said Tonga Cable Ltd.

“This needed to await the survey results which were being conducted by the New Zealand organization known as the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) in April/May 2022.""

After the order was placed, it took ASN a further seven months to manufacture the cable, stated TCL, and another four months for the order to be shipped from ASN in France, before a final two months for the cable ship to get to Tonga.

The actual repair of the cable took eight days, and was carried out by a crew of 57 people, with the cable repair ship, C/S Lodbrog, owned and operated jointly by ASN and Optic Marine (OMS).

MainOne says: “The cable has been tested to be in good operating condition and we have restored all services to normal operating conditions and provisioned additional capacity wavelengths to address [increased demand for internet connectivity from our wholesale and enterprise customers](http://www.capacitymedia.com/Article/3731332/MainOne-takes-to-data-centres-to-stimulate-sector) across west Africa.”

The cable, which was laid seven years ago as the first broadband cable to serve west Africa, was cut at 05:18 on 18 June.

“Initial investigation conducted into the failure of communications on the fibre pairs into Portugal indicated a fault on the submarine cable system, which was further localised to a location about 3000km south of Portugal, where the cable is at 3400m water depth,” says the report. “This assessment suggested that the outage was not a likely outcome of external human factors such as a dropped ship anchor or trawler fishing or sabotage since such activities generally do not take place at such ocean depths.”

The morning after the failure, the Pierre de Fermat was already on the way from its home port of Brest, heading for Portland in the UK to pick up spares.

The Pierre de Fermat arrived on site a week later, and grappled up the broken ends of the cable – showing a landslide was the most likely cause. The slide “trapped and crushed the cable thus resulting in a cut to both the fibre and power cables within the cable enclosure”. The damaged section was replaced with new cable from Portland, which was spliced into the broken ends.

Johannesburg, 14 Mar 2024

Subsea cable breaks caused widespread internet outages today.

Multiple subsea cable breaks are impacting internet connectivity in South Africa.

The cable outages are affecting several internet service providers and cloud service providers across the country, leaving some South Africans unconnected.  

In a statement on X, formerly Twitter, Vodacom says: “Certain customers are currently experiencing intermittent connectivity issues due to multiple undersea cable failures affecting SA’s network providers, including us. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.”

The outage has also affected services such as Microsoft Azure and Office 365.

Says Microsoft on Azure status: “Starting at 10:30 UTC on 14 March 2024, customers using Azure Services in South Africa North and South Africa West may experience increased network latency or packet drops when accessing their resources.”

In a new update, Microsoft says: “We have determined that multiple fibre cables on the West Coast of Africa — WACS, MainOne, SAT3, ACE — have been impacted which reduced total capacity supporting our regions in South Africa.

“In addition to these cable impacts, the ongoing cable cuts in the Red Sea — EIG, Seacom, AAE-1 — are also impacting capacity on the East Coast of Africa. This combination of incidents has impacted all Africa capacity – including other cloud providers and public internet as well.”

The affected companies did not disclose what caused the cables to break.

The latest outage comes after subsea cable operator Seacom recently encountered a service-affecting outage on its cable system in the Red Sea.

On Friday last week, the company said it is waiting for permits to start repairing its broken submarine cable in the Red Sea.","The article titled 'Multiple subsea cable breaks knock SA’s internet' discusses multiple subsea cable breaks that are impacting internet connectivity in South Africa.

It mentions 'subsea cable breaks' and 'undersea cable failures', and elaborates on the implications of these incidents, including specific examples of affected services such as Microsoft Azure and Office 365.

Plusieurs internautes et des sociétés usant de l’internet se sont à nouveau connectés grâce au succès de l’opération de réparation réalisée au large de Pointe-Noire où le câble sous-marin WACS a été sectionné. Il fallu attendre deux semaines pour que le bateau câblier affrété par la société ALCATEL et s’occupant de ces travaux arrive sur les côtes congolaises et commence la réparation. Le ministre Ibombo a lui-même fait l’annonce de la fin des travaux et du retour de l’internet sur les réseaux usuels.

D’après les autorités, un bateau de pêche appartenant à une société non identifiée, serait à l’origine de cet incident. Il aurait sectionné le câble à environ 10 Km au large de Pointe-Noire. Pour faire face à ces sérieuses perturbations constatées sur la fourniture de l’internet, le gouvernement a dû tendre la main aux autorités de Kinshasa où se trouve une station terminale à Moanda, dans le Sud-ouest de RDC.

The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) says voice and data services affected by undersea cable cuts along the Cote d’Ivoire and Senegal coasts have been restored.

In a Monday statement, the NCC Director of Public Affairs, Rueben Muoka, said that services have now been restored to approximately 90% of their peak utilization capacities.

“Following the disruption on March 14, 2024, which affected data and voice services due to cuts in undersea fibre optics along the coasts of Cote d’Ivoire and Senegal, we are pleased to announce that services have now been restored to approximately 90% of their peak utilization capacities,” the statement read.

“All operators who were impacted by the cuts have taken recovery capacity from submarine cables which were not impacted by the cuts, and have thus recovered approximately 90% of their peak utilisation capacities.”

The NCC spokesperson said that Mobile Network Operators have assured the commission that data and voice services would operate optimally pending full repairs of the undersea cables as they have managed to activate alternative connectivities to bring back the situation to normalcy.

It appreciated telecom consumers for their patience and understanding during the downtime caused by the undersea fibre cuts.

Since Thursday, telecommunications subscribers and bank users have been stranded as a subsea cable cut in the Atlantic Ocean offshore Cote D’Ivoire, along the coast of West Africa paralysed digital transactions and internet communications. Mobile network operators like MTN and some banks have attributed the network outage to a subsea cable cut in the Atlantic Ocean.

Submarine cable company, MainOne, had said it might take up to two weeks to repair the undersea cable cut that disrupted internet services in Nigeria, Ghana, Cote D’Ivoire, Senegal, and other West African and East African countries in the last four days.

Image: Nasa

**Seacom said on** Monday that it is experiencing a disruption affecting its cable system in the Red Sea, the site of current heightened geopolitical tensions.

News of the disruption comes just weeks after [warnings](https://techcentral.co.za/fears-red-sea-attack-on-internet-cables/239195/) that Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have been disrupting commercial shipping traffic in the region, might seek to sabotage Western internet cables in the Red Sea.

Seacom said in a statement that the portion of its East African cable system that transits the Red Sea went down on Saturday, affecting traffic flow between Africa and Europe.

“The disruption is only on the segment of the cable that runs from Mombasa (Kenya) to Zafarana (Egypt). Initial assessments suggest that the disruption to the subsea cable occurred within the vicinity of the Red Sea, and other cables in the area appear to have also been impacted,” it said.

It did not say which other cables were impacted, and there don’t yet appear to be any news reports of other cable outages in the Red Sea.

“At this time, Seacom is unable to confirm the cause of the disruption but is working with its cable repair partner to assess the feasibility of the repair in the region. The location of the cable break is significant due to its geopolitical sensitivity and ongoing tensions, making it a challenging environment for maintenance and repair operations.”

### Little impact

The outage appears to have had little impact on international internet traffic to South Africa, probably because new cable systems, including Google’s newly launched Equiano system, now provide a secondary, high-capacity route to Europe along Africa’s west coast.

Earlier this month, TechCentral reported that the [threat by Houthi rebels](https://techcentral.co.za/fears-red-sea-attack-on-internet-cables/239195/) in Yemen to destroy internet infrastructure in the Red Sea, if carried out, might not be enough to destabilise the internet in Africa.

Apart from being one of the world’s busiest shipping corridors, the Red Sea is also host to some of the world’s biggest intercontinental subsea cables, including several that run along Africa’s east coast, TechCentral has reported.

The news reports about a potential attack on the subsea cables come after a Houthi-linked Telegram channel published a map of the cables running through the Red Sea along with what has been interpreted as a veiled threat.

Seacom said it “continues to carry traffic on its own cable between Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and South Africa for both transmission and IP (internet protocol) services”.

“All other IP-based services destined for Europe and other regions were automatically rerouted via Seacom’s alternative routes on the Equiano, Peace and Wacs cable systems and supported by its diverse terrestrial infrastructure, ensuring its clients remain operational with some latency in their internet communications,” the company said.

Seacom warned its customers earlier this month that any disruptions to the cable system in the Red Sea could be impacted by delays in repair operations due to the instability of the area. “The team is currently working towards restoration timelines and will communicate these plans with our clients,” it said in its statement on Monday. – _© 2024 NewsCentral Media_","The article titled 'Seacom is down in the Red Sea' discusses a disruption affecting Seacom's cable system in the Red Sea, directly mentioning 'subsea cable' and 'cable system'.

By Adam Blenford  
BBC News, Kigali  

Rory Cellan-Jones climbs aboard the bus bringing internet to Rwandan communities.  

Landlocked Rwanda is weeks away from completing a link to a new fibre-optic network promising high-speed internet for East Africa, officials say.  
Engineers expect the capital, Kigali, to be connected to newly arrived undersea cables in Kenya by November.  
A national fibre-optic ring is due to go online early in 2010.  
The new link is the key part of a plan to transform Rwanda from an impoverished, agricultural society into a hi-tech economic innovator.  
Most of Rwanda's nine million inhabitants still make a living from small-scale farming, and much of the country remains without basic services - including a reliable electricity supply.  
Yet 15 years after a genocide, which saw around 800,000 Rwandans brutally murdered, the government - led by one-time rebel leader President Paul Kagame - appears determined to push ahead with development on multiple fronts.  

**There's no guarantee that a country which is still hugely dependent on foreign aid will achieve its ambition to become a high-tech knowledge economy**  
Rory Cellan-Jones  
BBC technology correspondent  

Rwanda remains one of the poorest countries in the world, but has a fast-growing population, of which more than 50% are aged 14 or under.  
""We're in a hurry,"" Patrick Nyirishema told the BBC. ""In five or 10 years' time, all those people are going to be looking for jobs.""  
Mr Nyirishema, a slight man of 34, took up his post at the helm of Rwanda's Information Technology Authority just one week ago. He found 160 ongoing projects in his in-tray.  
""Rwanda is the most densely populated country in the continent, and most of our people are subsistence farmers,"" he said.  
""We can't wait until we have water, until we have built roads, before we get round to ICT (information and communications technology). We have to do everything at the same time.""  

**Held back**  
Evidence of Africa's need for faster connectivity is easy to spot.  
In central Kigali, towering satellite dishes belonging to one private company bring in most of the country's existing internet bandwidth.  
As in other parts of East Africa which have long relied on satellite connections, the links are in the hands of a handful of operators and are sold on at high prices way out of reach of most ordinary Rwandans.  

Preparations are being made to turn Rwanda into a hi-tech hub.  
For a country which has publicly stated an ambition to turn itself into ""the Singapore of Africa"" - a globally important centre for business and communications - the reliance on satellite has held the country back.  
Most Rwandans lack significant computer skills and few have regular access to the internet. Many of those who do are yet to explore the web's full potential.  
""I first used the internet one year ago,"" said Carine Umulisa, a 24-year-old Kigali student.  
""I sometimes go to the cyber cafe and I send messages to my family. It's very expensive now. But it's important for Rwanda to develop technology.""  
Even where there is bandwidth, people struggle with unpredictable connections. A bus carrying 20 laptop computers is currently travelling the country offering internet services to students and local business people.  
When BBC News visited the bus in Kamonyi district, an area just 30 minutes' drive from Kigali but without any mains electricity, the connection was so erratic that the young people using the facility were unable even to sign up for their first e-mail account.  

**Great leap forward**  
At the national stadium in Kigali, inconspicuous antennae tethered to a floodlight pylon are the only outward sign of one of Rwanda's most arresting projects.  
When operational, the antennae will blanket the city with a WiBro (Wireless Broadband) signal - a state-of-the-art South Korean wireless protocol - sometimes known as Wimax - designed to funnel data at high speed to new 4G mobile devices.  
It is a clear statement of intent - building a 21st Century mobile data network in a country where many people still eke out a 19th Century existence.  
But officials brush off suggestions that the WiBro network could be too niche, or that the cost of compatible devices will be prohibitively high. Linking Rwanda to the technology giants of South Korea and China is as safe as bets come, they say.  
""We are really focussing on the future,"" one project engineer, Manzi Rwaka, told the BBC. ""We are doing our best not to be left out of the world.""  
In a way, Mr Rwaka, 27, embodies the new country Rwanda is trying to become. Born outside of Rwanda after his family fled following the first outbreak of deadly civil violence in 1959, his parents chose to return home after the 1994 genocide, when Paul Kagame's RPF took power.  
Fifteen years later, and with a university education in South Africa under his belt, Mr Rwaka works on the WiBro project and speaks in an almost evangelical tone about the future of his country.  
""Coming from where we have been, we really want to focus on our position in the region. We know we are in a difficult situation but we are trying to get out of it. We want a solid economy and we will get there.  
""If we sit down and wait for others to do something [we] might be waiting forever.""  

**Critics muted**  
As the size of Mr Nyirishema's in-tray suggests, the WiBro plan is just one of many technology projects Rwanda's government is trying to push through in a hurry.  
But while the scale of the ambition is clear, concerns remain that the government may be aiming too high.  
In stark contrast to a regional neighbour such as Kenya, where mobile phone penetration is almost universal, just 20% of Rwandans own mobile phones, state media reported this week.  
In an effort to boost mobile phone use and give farmers easy access to market information, the government plans to hand out 35,000 mobile phones across the country as part of a joint venture with major telecoms operators.  
According to accepted international indicators Rwanda remains a desperately poor country, with a per capita annual income of just $315. Women each have an average of 5.5 children.  
And some Western observers are critical of President Paul Kagame's hard-headed style of government. Amnesty International's annual report on global human rights issues regularly highlights the restricted nature of political debate in Rwanda and the lack of a free press.  
But Mr Kagame, president since 2001, appears to remain genuinely popular and plans to stand for a second full seven-year term in elections in 2010. Two other candidates are likely to stand - neither is expected to come close to victory.  
Despite his authoritarian tendencies, at the moment Mr Kagame appears to have support for his efforts to transform his country. He first identified technology as the way forward for Rwanda back in 1997, as the country began its long recovery from genocide.  
Today, in a continent cursed with leaders who show an authoritarian streak and yet fail to improve the lot of their people, few appear willing to criticise Mr Kagame.  
""Technology sits at the centre of everything we do,"" Patrick Nyirishema explained.  
""But the biggest challenge we face is skills. Every extra step we take comes with a need for new skills.""  
With the arrival of East Africa's fibre-optic cables, Paul Kagame's bold strategy is about to get the connectivity it needs.  
Whether the farmers and schoolchildren in electricity-starved Kamonyi can become the skilled workers Rwanda needs in the years to come is yet to be seen.","The article 'Bold Rwanda takes broadband leap' mentions 'newly arrived undersea cables' and discusses their significance for improving Rwanda's internet connectivity.

Eight West African countries were suffering a second day of major connectivity issues on Friday with users in South Africa also affected, after damage to four sub-sea cables. The cause of the cable cutting was still not known, though a shifting of the seabed was among the likely possibilities.

“Repairs can take weeks to months, depending on where the damage is, what needs to be repaired, and local weather conditions,” said a spokesperson at internet analytics firm Cloudflare. “The assignment of repair ships depends on a number of factors, including ownership of the impacted cables.”

The West Africa Cable System, MainOne, South Atlantic 3, and ACE sea cables – arteries for telecommunications data – were all affected on Thursday and Friday.

MTN Group – one of the largest wireless carriers in Africa – said that ACE and WACS have jointly initiated the repair process, and that they would send a vessel to fix the damaged cables.

Orange Marine said the firm was one of the specialist companies that would be involved in the repair operations for the cables, adding that other companies are also involved in efforts to restore the various cables. It said the repair time is not yet known.

Data show a major disruption to connectivity in eight West African countries, with Ivory Coast, Liberia and Benin being the most affected, NetBlocks, an internet watchdog, said in a post on X. Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon are among other countries impacted. Several companies have also reported service disruptions in South Africa.

Ghana’s main stock exchange extended trading hours by an hour on Thursday and Friday, while Nigeria’s second-largest cement maker scrapped a call with investors as the damage to four subsea cables off the west coast of Africa, stymied businesses across parts of the continent.

“This is a devastating blow to internet connectivity along the west coast of Africa, which will be operating in a degraded state for weeks to come,” said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis firm Kentik.

Ghana’s National Communications Authority said cable disruptions also occurred in Senegal and Portugal.

“This has led to a significant degradation of data services across the country, with mobile network operators working around the clock to restore full services,” the authority said.

Red Sea
-------

The cable faults off Ivory Coast come less than a month after three telecommunications cables were severed in the Red Sea, highlighting the vulnerability of critical communications infrastructure. The anchor of a cargo ship sunk by Houthi militants was probably responsible, according to assessments by the US and cable industry group the Internet Cable Protection Committee.

Together, the problems with cables on either side of the continent create a capacity crunch, with customers of those cables scrambling to find alternative routes.

Microsoft Corp. reported disruptions to its cloud services and Microsoft 365 applications across Africa.

The Downdetector website showed that a number of companies in South Africa were still severely affected on Friday, including Microsoft and Nedbank Group.

Telkom SA SOC’s Openserve fiber unit and Standard Bank Group were also affected, they said in statement, with Openserve adding it had re-routed traffic.

Off the southeastern coast of South Africa, the island country of Mauritius also experienced outages, with Mauritius Telecom having to arrange to redirect traffic to other cables, it said.

Last year, WACS, along with another pipe – the South Atlantic 3 – were damaged near the mouth of the Congo River following an undersea landslide. The loss of the cables knocked out international traffic traveling along the west coast of Africa and took about a month to repair.","The article titled 'Africa Internet Outage Risks Leaving Millions Offline for Weeks' explicitly discusses the damage to undersea cables off the west coast of Africa, which has led to significant internet connectivity issues across multiple countries.

[MyBroadband](https://mybroadband.co.za/news/fibre/503508-slow-internet-speeds-in-south-africa-break-in-undersea-cables.html) reports the West African Cable System (WACS) and the South Atlantic 3 (SAT-3/WASC) undersea cables have been broken.

The two cables reportedly suffered breaks between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon due to two separate rock falls in the Congo Canyon on Sunday.

The cable ship _CS Léon Thévenin_ has been mobilized for the deep-water repair, but could take several weeks to arrive at the break site as it is currently sailing from Kenya on the east coast of Africa and will have to sail around the Horn of Africa.

Telkom’s wholesale fixed-line division Openserve has confirmed the issue but hasn’t provided an estimated repair date.

“Openserve can confirm the breaks of the WACS and SAT-3 undersea cables. We are collaborating with the consortium partners to facilitate the restoration of these cables. The impact on our network is limited to customers on the international private leased circuits (IPLC) services,” the company said.

“The Openserve network remains robust due to our investment in other international cable capacity, hence all Openserve IP Transit services (WebReach) traffic have been automatically re-routed, ensuring our customers stay seamlessly connected.”

SA's state-owned wholesale infrastructure provider Broadband Infraco confirmed the cable break in a now-deleted post on X [previously Twitter].

Cameroonian telco CamTel also [noted the issue](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/camtel-cm_communique-activity-7094349523589750784-0Ov0); however, it said the SAT-3 cable suffered damages off the coast of Gabon and on the land section of Abidjan on the Ivory Coast.

Telecom Namibia also [reported issues](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/telecomnamibiaofficial_poor-connectivity-due-to-wacs-and-sat-3-fibre-activity-7094632922577612800-TAqR?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) due to the cuts. Stanley Shanapinda, Telecom Namibia’s CEO, said: “Telecom Namibia would like to assure its customers that it is working around the clock with its international support partners to ensure that all functionalities are fully restored to normalcy. We have been proactive by re-routing the traffic to ensure our customers stay seamlessly connected.”

**_Update_**: David Eurin, CEO of Liquid Dataport, a business of Liquid Intelligent Technologies, said: “As part of our disaster recovery process and to offer high redundancy to our customers, we have migrated our customers’ West Coast traffic to our new Equiano subsea cable. Whilst this additional capacity has brought in a much-needed increase in bandwidth in Western and Southern Africa, the redundancy is also the reason why we are able to minimize the impact on our customers.”

Congo Canyon is a submarine canyon found at the end of the Congo River in Africa. It is one of the largest submarine canyons in the world, reaching depths of 1,100 meters and widths of up to nine miles (14km).

Laid in 2012, the 14,500 km WACS cable runs from South Africa to the UK, calling at 12 countries en route. Owned by a consortium of 12 carriers including MTN and Vodacom, it has a total design capacity of 14.5 Tbps.

The 13000km SAT-3/WASC cable, laid in 2001, connects South Africa to Spain and Portugal and lands at eight other countries en route. SAT-3 has a capacity of 340 Gbps and is owned by a consortium of operators including Orange (then France Telecom), AT&T-owned TCI, Sonatel, and Telcom.

“Multiple undersea cable failures between South Africa and Europe are currently impacting South Africa’s network providers, including Vodacom,” Vodacom spokesman Byron Kennedy told TechCentral at 2.22pm on Thursday.

Multiple sources have told TechCentral that there has been an undersea incident impacting multiple cables along Africa’s west coast. According to Microsoft, four cables have been affected.

One source said the break may have occurred off the coast of Abidjan, the capital of the Ivory Coast in West Africa. The main internet cables that connect South Africa to Europe run along the west coast of Africa, including the West Africa Cable System (Wacs) and Google’s Equiano cable.

According to Microsoft, the affected cables are Wacs, MainOne, Sat-3 and Ace.

This is the second time in seven months that a major cable break along Africa’s coastline has severely impacted internet services in South Africa.

And the latest outage could not have come at a worse time, given that the Seacom cable, which connects South Africa to Europe along Africa’s east coast, was [recently severed](https://techcentral.co.za/seacom-is-down-in-the-red-sea/240276/) in the Red Sea, possibly as the result of a ship’s anchor.

He added that network providers were forced to provide internet using V-SAT which is slow and expensive as a result of huge taxes paid to use the service.

This was connected via a cable from Kinshasa in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo.

The internet's largest and most important -- and yet unsung -- champions are the privately-owned submarine cables that orbit the Earth. Terra firma links between cities and cables that run alongside roads and into houses and officers are certainly impressive -- and without them we wouldn't have an internet! -- but sinking a cable into the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and even Arctic Oceans requires a billion-dollar logistical feat that requires months or even years to enact.

Across these cables, which span distances of up to 13,000 km (8,000 miles) and have total lengths over 21,000 km (13,000 miles), terabits of information squirt from one side of the planet to another. To get from London to Tokyo, your packets can traverse Europe, the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea, the Indian Ocean, and finally the South China Sea -- or they can hop across the Atlantic, the entirety of continental North America, and then long haul over the Pacific. For a complete (and interactive!) view of the world's 188 planned and active submarine cables, check out Greg's Cable Map or TeleGeography.

These cables are just three inches thick, carry just a few optic fibers, and have total capacities of between 40Gbps and 10Tbps, and latencies that are close to the speed of light and just a few milliseconds in duration. These cables shouldn't run out of capacity any time soon, too: we're already at the stage where we can send 40Gbps over a single fiber, and graphene optical switches should expand the total capacity of submarine cables (and the terminating routers) into the petabit- and exabit-per-second range. In the image to the right, #1 is polyethylene, #2 is mylar tape, #3 is stranded steel wires, #4 is an aluminium waterproofing layer, #5 is polycarbonate, #6 is a copper or aluminium tube, #7 is petroleum jelly, and #8 is the optical fiber itself.

As far as laying a submarine cable, specialized cable-laying ships must be used -- and again, when a cable is broken (usually by a trawler, but sometimes a whale!), another special ship must be used. This generally means that laying a cable is logistically challenging and very expensive -- and when a cable breaks, it sometimes isn't possible to fix it immediately if a cable-fixing ship isn't nearby (and for this reason, most submarine cables use a ring topology in case one stretch is broken).

It's also amazing to consider that the first trans-Atlantic cables were laid in the 1860s, and trans-Pacific cables followed in the early 1900s. These cables were incredibly low-bandwidth -- repeaters didn't exist yet, so the only way of getting a signal across the pond was by upping the voltage and creating a very noisy link -- but by the early 1900s, the British Empire had already connected up most of the continents (see below). It's also worth noting that the only continent that isn't wired into the internet is Antarctica; the temperature of the Antarctic Ocean is too low, and the movement of the ice shelf by up to 10 meters per year is tricky to overcome.

Finally, we would be remiss to ignore geostationary, orbital communications satellites. While satellite data links can be in the gigabit range, the high latency of bouncing a signal through a point that is rather far away (35,000 km, 22,000 miles) makes them unsuitable for many consumer internet services. This same latency will pose some big problems when we start colonizing other planets and need to create an interplanetary (or intergalactic) internet.

Eight West African countries were suffering a second day of major connectivity issues on Friday with users in South Africa also affected, after damage to four sub-sea cables. The cause of the cable cutting was still not known, though a shifting of the seabed was among the likely possibilities.

“Repairs can take weeks to months, depending on where the damage is, what needs to be repaired, and local weather conditions,” said a spokesperson at internet analytics firm Cloudflare. “The assignment of repair ships depends on a number of factors, including ownership of the impacted cables.”

The West Africa Cable System, MainOne, South Atlantic 3, and ACE sea cables – arteries for telecommunications data – were all affected on Thursday and Friday.

MTN Group – one of the largest wireless carriers in Africa – said that ACE and WACS have jointly initiated the repair process, and that they would send a vessel to fix the damaged cables.

Orange Marine said the firm was one of the specialist companies that would be involved in the repair operations for the cables, adding that other companies are also involved in efforts to restore the various cables. It said the repair time is not yet known.

Data show a major disruption to connectivity in eight West African countries, with Ivory Coast, Liberia and Benin being the most affected, NetBlocks, an internet watchdog, said in a post on X. Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon are among other countries impacted. Several companies have also reported service disruptions in South Africa.

Ghana’s main stock exchange extended trading hours by an hour on Thursday and Friday, while Nigeria’s second-largest cement maker scrapped a call with investors as the damage to four subsea cables off the west coast of Africa, stymied businesses across parts of the continent.

“This is a devastating blow to internet connectivity along the west coast of Africa, which will be operating in a degraded state for weeks to come,” said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis firm Kentik.

Ghana’s National Communications Authority said cable disruptions also occurred in Senegal and Portugal.

“This has led to a significant degradation of data services across the country, with mobile network operators working around the clock to restore full services,” the authority said.

Red Sea
-------

The cable faults off Ivory Coast come less than a month after three telecommunications cables were severed in the Red Sea, highlighting the vulnerability of critical communications infrastructure. The anchor of a cargo ship sunk by Houthi militants was probably responsible, according to assessments by the US and cable industry group the Internet Cable Protection Committee.

Together, the problems with cables on either side of the continent create a capacity crunch, with customers of those cables scrambling to find alternative routes.

Microsoft Corp. reported disruptions to its cloud services and Microsoft 365 applications across Africa.

The Downdetector website showed that a number of companies in South Africa were still severely affected on Friday, including Microsoft and Nedbank Group.

Telkom SA SOC’s Openserve fiber unit and Standard Bank Group were also affected, they said in statement, with Openserve adding it had re-routed traffic.

Connections are slow and expensive. Earlier this month, a fibre optic cable was brought ashore which some claim will transform the country's communications.**

A crowd gathers on a sandy beach near central Monrovia to watch as a diver emerges from the sea. He's pulling a rope which a team on the beach helps drag ashore. Eventually, a black cable pops out of the water and slithers up the sand, prompting cheers from the crowd.

In the background, several miles offshore, a French ship is at anchor. It's dragging the cable 17,000km (10,000 miles) from France to Cape Town, via the west coast of Africa.

The cable, which is just two inches thick but stuffed with fibre optics, is known as the Africa Coast to Europe (ACE) system, run by a consortium led by French Telecom. It will eventually provide broadband connectivity to more than 20 countries.

**Celebration**

News of the cable's arrival on land is welcomed by a small group of men in an internet cafe in Monrovia. For them, getting online currently costs around $2 per hour - more money than many Liberians earn in a day.

""The internet here is very slow,"" says Emmanuel Dolo who is trying to apply for a scholarship online. ""Sometimes you pay for an hour and only get to use 20 minutes. It just keeps loading and loading. It's frustrating.""

Liberia's business community feels the same way, says Ciata Victor, a businesswoman who returned from abroad in 2003 after the prolonged civil war - which destroyed much of the country's infrastructure - ended. ""I moved my company home from America to Liberia and internet access has been extremely challenging. I have paid as high as $449 a month,"" she says.

**Cheaper and faster**

The current high cost and relatively slow internet connection in Liberia is not surprising, says Calestous Juma, Professor of the Practice of International Development at Harvard, and an expert in telecommunications in Africa. ""Fibre optic cables have more capacity and provide more consistent data flow than the current satellite connections being used,"" he says. ""Satellite communication involves sending a signal into orbit and back. The delay, or latency, can take up to a second and that affects the quality of communication.""

Initial start-up costs for satellite transmission are also very high, he adds. That's in part why there is so much excitement over the arrival of the fibre optic cable. ""In West Africa our penetration is very low,"" says Blidi Elliott who works on a World Bank project to increase the geographical reach of broadband in Liberia. ""During the civil war years the political will needed to bring broadband to the country was not there."" It is now, he says.

**An internet boom?**

For Liberia, as well as Gambia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the ACE submarine cable is the first connection to a fibre optic system. And it's part of a developing pattern in Africa, where currently only 9.6% of people are web users, compared to around 65% of Europeans. Africa may be lagging behind, but recent reports, including a study from the World Bank, suggest it's on the verge of an internet boom.

Mr Elliott says he's confident that internet use in Liberia will increase by 75% in the next four years, even though many people have never even used a computer. Mr Juma from Harvard says that may not be the obstacle it seems.

**Obstacles remain**

But if that step sounds easy, the next practical steps for this project in Liberia, sound a lot tougher. ""Landing the cable in Monrovia is a first important step,"" says Mr Juma. ""The next will be installing terrestrial cables for the national and local networks, as well as for mobile phone towers. This will require major additional investment."" The ACE cable will eventually connect 23 countries including Mauritania, Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Mali and Niger, which are landlocked, will be connected via an overland cable. Project leaders say, all being well, the cable system in Liberia will be switched on in the middle of next year.","The article discusses the arrival of the ACE submarine cable to Liberia, directly referring to it as a 'submarine cable' and highlighting its significance for improving internet connectivity in the region.

It elaborates on the implications of this cable, noting that it will provide broadband connectivity to over 20 countries and transform communications in Liberia.

“Linking Malaysia and Singapore with Oman and the UAE, with branches to India and Sri Lanka, the cable provides ample diversity to South East Asia, India, Middle East and European routes,” the consortium said in a statement.

The cost of the project was not divulged.

In addition to Reliance Jio, the partners in the Bay of Bengal Gateway, as the cable network is called, include: Dialog Axiata, Etisalat, Omantel, Telecom Malaysia, and Vodafone. The Indian company Reliance Jio has invested in the system as part of its broadband plans.

“This brings key global content hubs closer to our customers, delivering much richer experience as an important part of driving India’s broadband adoption and enabling consumers to shift away from the current high-cost low value propositions,” Jio president Mathew Oommen said.

The Indian company owns and operates the strategically important undersea cable landing facility in Chennai, providing high-speed, high-capacity, low latency route to connect the subcontinent with the rest of the world.

The Bay of Bengal Gateway has deployed the latest submarine cable transmission technology with an initial capacity of 9 terabits per second and a design capacity that can take it up to as much as 55 terabits per second, the consortium said.

The network can also be used to interconnect with existing land and undersea cables at Oman and the UAE for Europe, Middle East and Africa — and similarly at Malaysia and Singapore for Far East Asia, all the way to the US.

It also promises enhanced reliability as the marine route design is such that it avoids the busy and crowded Malacca Straits and other cable-cut prone areas with diverse terrestrial connection directly to two gateways in Singapore, the consortium said.

There is local phone service within each island, but island to island and long distance is out. The outage is affecting 911 service from Lopez, Shaw and Orcas to dispatch on Friday Harbor.

For Friday Harbor residents, there is also no cell coverage or internet service.

The outage is due to a problem with the underwater cable between Lopez and San Juan Islands. No ETA for return of service, but this is a significant repair that will require specialized equipment and personnel to fix. OPALCO has a robust data communications infrastructure installed across the county to serve our electrical distribution system and is making those resources available to aid its fellow utility.

Centurylink issued the following statement:

A fiber optic cable has been cut underwater between Lopez and San Juan Islands impacting CenturyLink services, including 911 services, throughout the islands. 911 services on San Juan Island have been rerouted to the local 911 center. Customers are able to access the Internet on all islands with the exception of San Juan Island. Because of the nature of the damage it is difficult to estimate a time of restoral. CenturyLink is working to restore services as soon as possible.

To access 911, call the following numbers:

Lopez Island: 468-2991

Orcas Island: 376-2331

Shaw Island: 468-2991

San Juan Island’s 911 is still operational.

For those who rely on Life Alert or Medic Alert, those will likely not work in the event of an emergency. Most life alert systems route via the phone line to an off-island call center, making that connection impossible at present. The Orcas Senior Center is asking who anyone who uses a personal emergency paging device to call 376-2677. Staff will work on a case by case basis to develop a contact plan to assist in ensuring people remain safe during this time.

News from Sen. Kevin Ranker

“It is confirmed that a deep water offshore cable was completely severed. CenturyLink has divers and an ROV (Remotely operated vehicle) on scene. The ultimate goal will be to replace the entire 14,000′ cable, but locating that length of fiber-optic cable will take time. In the meantime two more immediate actions are underway. First, CenturyLink is working with OPALCO to do a short term Ethernet fix so that our entire county would have 911 availability as soon as possible – maybe as soon as late today. Secondly, CenturyLink has identified 6,000 feet of cable that could be used as a temporary fix that would give all county residents all services.

**Two subsea** **broadband** cable breaks were resulting in slow international connectivity on some internet providers on Monday.

Openserve, Telkom’s wholesale subsidiary, which is responsible for the cable landing stations in South Africa for both the West African Cable System ([Wacs](https://wacscable.com/aboutus.jsp)) and [Sat-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT-3/WASC), confirmed in response to a query from TechCentral that both cables are affected and it is “collaborating with the consortium partners to facilitate the restoration of the cables”.

Sat-3, the older of the two cables, carries relatively little international internet traffic; Wacs, on the other hand, is a more recent cable system and is used extensively to carry traffic between South Africa and Europe.

Broken subsea cables are repaired by specialised ships, one or more of which will have to be commissioned to go to the site of the cable breaks and begin repairs. TechCentral was not able to ascertain the reason for the cable breaks or where exactly they occurred. However, state-owned infrastructure company Broadband Infraco tweeted that it had information that the break in the Wacs cable had occurred in the [Congo Canyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Canyon) off the coast of the Democratic Republic of Congo, 3 686km north of the Yzerfontein landing station near Cape Town.

Until recently, a break in two submarine cables would have meant the global internet being barely accessible by South African users. However, new, high-capacity cables have been built in recent years, providing much more bandwidth along diverse routes, meaning that when there is an outage, the impact is no longer as serious.

Still, the Wacs and Sat-3 outages do appear to be affecting the performance of some service providers. A [speed test](https://www.speedtest.net/) to London on Vodacom Business fibre, for example, delivered a download speed of just 3Mbit/s on Monday afternoon.

### Cable breaks

Telkom claimed the impact on its network is “limited to customers on the international private leased-circuit services”.

“The Openserve network remains robust due to our investment in other international cable capacity, hence all Openserve IP transit services traffic has been automatically rerouted, ensuring our customers stay seamlessly connected. No official restoration timeline has been communicated by the consortium.” — _© 2023 NewsCentral Media_

""We're working diligently on all the islands throughout the company...and pursuing all avenues to bring it to a swift closure,"" Oehlerking said.

The outage affected the commonwealth's population of more than 51,000 people. Some cell phone customers on Guam also couldn't make calls or use the Internet.

The outage cut phone, banking, Internet and other communications. It affected credit-card purchases, withdrawals from ATMs and all other communications using the islands' only fiber-optic cable connection to the outside world.

The Guam Pacific Daily News reported that when the undersea cable snapped on Wednesday, no phone calls could be made into the Northern Mariana Islands unless people had access to one of the few satellite phones on the main island of Saipan.

The cause of the undersea cable break remains under investigation, but may have been the result of undersea activity caused by violent weather, Oehlerking said.

""We probably won't get a good feel for it until the repair boat comes in and brings the cable up,"" Oehlerking said.

This move will benefit users who have suffered over the past three weeks, since underwater fiber optic cables were clipped.

“This will allow automatic sharing of bandwidth between operators at pre-negotiated prices to avoid service interruptions in case of any breakdown,” the government said in a statement.

“The Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority (RURA) will institute a settlement system in the next few days to allow inter-operator bandwidth backup and seamless routing once any operator’s available bandwidth reduces to a pre-determined threshold,” it added.

The move comes as telecom operators struggle to provide services to customers since the EASSY cable was cut between Djibouti and Port Sudan on 17 February carrying around 80% of traffic.

"Google's Submarine Cable Plans Get Official","Investment in Unity submarine cable project to meet rising bandwidth demand; expected capacity details included.","https://www.wired.com/2008/02/googles-submari","2008-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","Bryan Gardiner",Yes,"Bryan Gardiner","San Francisco, California, USA",-,"2008-02-26","English","Wired","Five months after EPICENTER first reported on Google's rumored under seas ambitions, the company has made it official: The search giant will be joining five other telecom companies -- Bharti Airtel, Global Transit, KDDI, Pacnet and SingTel -- to jointly finance a new trans-Pacific ""Unity"" cable linking the U.S. to Japan.

As we noted back in September, existing trans-Pacific cables generally provide on average 3.3 tbps of capacity. But bandwidth is getting tight and carriers have recently been scrambling to upgrade these cables or, in some cases, build entirely new ones (like Verizon).

According to research firm TeleGeography, trans-Pacific internet traffic shot up 41 percent between mid-2006 and mid-2007. But as the only non-telecom company in the new consortium, don't expect Google's involvement to signal a new trend, analysts warn.

""Although many non-telecom companies have high bandwidth requirements, few will venture into owning submarine cables anytime soon,"" said TeleGeography's research director Alan Mauldin in a Monday research note.

That likely has a lot to do with cost. As it stands, the Unity cable will cost $300 million to build and the task will be split between Tyco Telecommunications and NEC.

Add to that the fact that the sub-sea cable business isn't the most stable or lucrative, and Google's involvement seems more of an attempt simply to bring down the cost of moving massive amounts of traffic around the world.

""You add markets with new supply, and the price is bound to come down,"" Eric Schoonover, a senior analyst at TeleGeography told Wired last fall. ""There's even a risk of it collapsing,"" he says, as it did in 2000.

Nevertheless, Google's investment in the Unity cable seems to be in line with the company's approach to buying (and lighting) dark fiber here in the U.S., experts say, and will now give it the chance to acquire even more capacity at cost.

Unity is initially expected to increase trans–Pacific lit cable capacity by about 20 percent, according to Telegeography, with the potential to add up to 7.68 tbps of bandwidth across the Pacific.

Google says the 6214 mile cable will provide connectivity between the Tokyo coast and Los Angeles, as well as other West Coast network points -- unless an anchor falls on it. Construction will begin immediately.

The one thing no one discussed on Monday was how much Google (or any other consortium member) is actually chipping in for Unity. Based on previous conversations with analysts, your bandwidth seems to be proportionate to the amount to money you plug into the consortium for buildout and other infrastructure costs. If everyone's forking over $50,000,000, that's one thing. But if Google feels it wants (or needs) a little extra bandwidth, the company could end up fronting quite a bit more than 50 mil. Google did not immediately respond to our request for comment.","The article 'Google's Submarine Cable Plans Get Official' discusses Google's investment in the Unity submarine cable project, which is a direct reference to undersea cables.

By Adam Blenford
BBC News, Nairobi

A new high-speed undersea cable connecting East Africa with the rest of the world is poised to go live, Kenya's top internet official has told the BBC.

The launch of the government-backed East African Marine System (Teams) comes as providers face a backlash over slow connection speeds and high prices. Internet providers have increased speeds and lowered costs since the Seacom cable went live in August. But users say services still remain too expensive for most ordinary Kenyans.

Senior government official Bitange Ndemo said there was evidence that some internet service providers (ISPs) were ""fleecing the public"". Almost two months after the first high-speed cable made landfall, the highest residential internet speed offered by Kenya's largest ISP remains capped at one megabit per second (Mbps). That speed is available only at night and at weekends, for an annual cost of $1,440 (£860). The average Kenyan annual wage is about $800, the UN estimates.

**Dongle dilemmas**
Until late July, East African internet users were forced to pay for connections routed through expensive satellite connections. Uptake was slowed by costs and business competitiveness was hampered by the delay in sending data from one point to another via satellite.

But with the imminent availability of the 1.28 terabits per second Teams connectivity, business figures, ISPs and the Kenyan government now insist that high-speed, low-cost internet is just around the corner. Links are being completed to other East African nations, ""digital villages"" are being built in rural areas, and the speeds on offer are increasing, albeit slowly.

""The cable is here, it is functional, and they are selling capacity,"" Bitange Ndemo told the BBC. However, some in Nairobi feel that the cables themselves were over-hyped. ""I thought the cable would land and the next week we would have fast internet at home,"" said Ken Kasima, a developer for the successful crowdsourcing service Ushahidi. Speaking at a cafe in the basement of a Nairobi shopping centre where fellow developers and programmers meet to use a free wi-fi connection, Mr Kasima said the price of his 512kbps internet connection was preventing him working effectively at home.

Rory Cellan-Jones visits St Charles Lwanga Secondary in Mombasa which cannot afford a web connection. His connection, like much of Kenya's personal internet in a country without a significant landline telephone network, is delivered by a mobile phone operator via a 3G dongle connected by USB. A top-up card gives him 1GB of data use for a fee of 2,500 Kenyan shillings (£20; $33). At that price, Mr Kasima insists he needs to carefully control what he does online in an effort not to waste his credit and his money. Even if the connection allowed it - which it barely does - listening to music or watching video online is not sensible. ""When you take it in comparison to what you're doing, it's a lot (of money), trust me. It's like spending a million to buy a wheelbarrow,"" Mr Kasima said.

**Slow process**
Perhaps surprisingly, the managing director of one of Kenya's most prominent ISPs agrees with part of Mr Kasima's analysis. Jonathan Somen of Access Kenya told the BBC that some in the communications industry were guilty of making unwise pronouncements before the cables landed.

But Mr Somen - whose company is a shareholder in Teams - freely admitted that his products were aimed at business users and ""high-end"" residential customers, pointing out that Kenya needs major and costly investment to build a modern telecoms infrastructure. ""A lot of companies, ourselves included, have made significant investments in international and local infrastructure to deliver the new bandwidth,"" Mr Somen said. ""The more people get connected the more the economies of scale will kick in and prices will come down, but you can't expect fibre to land and that's the answer to all of our prayers. You have got to go through the stages to build up the infrastructure and the content.""

His attitude is at odds with the approach of Bitange Ndemo, who called for those companies with investments to pay off to lower their prices to attract new customers. ""In Africa the argument is always that there are fewer customers so there is a need to charge a high premium,"" he said. ""That is what annoys me, because you need to have low prices to get more people.""

**Market forces**
On the outskirts of Nairobi, though, one place where prices have fallen is KenCall, an outsourcing company which says data costs have shrunk by 90% since Seacom went online. Where the company previously paid $3,000 for a one megabit per second (Mbps) connection via satellite, it now pays just $300, operations director Eric Nesbitt said. As a firm which routinely deals with foreign clients and tries to offer Africa as a viable business alternative to clients in Europe, the US and beyond, that cost reduction is critical. ""We are now on equal terms with the rest of the world,"" Mr Nesbitt said, predicting that Kenya would now be just three years behind a country like the UK in adopting the latest technology.

Adverts around Nairobi seem to back Mr Nesbitt's analysis. Billboards promoting digital TV packages and internet bundles loom large over the city. Internet TV is on the way. For Bitange Ndemo, the opportunities offered by the new connections are virtually unlimited. ""We have just opened our market from 37 million to six billion,"" he said. ""We can become players if we work with a purpose. Africa can only succeed if we think that way.""","The article 'New Africa broadband link 'ready'' discusses the launch of undersea cables, specifically the Seacom and Teams cables, and their implications for internet connectivity in East Africa.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - A severed marine cable has left Somalia without internet for weeks, triggering losses for businesses, residents said, and adding a layer of chaos in a country where Islamist insurgents are carrying out a campaign of bombings and killings.

Abdi Anshuur, Somalia's minister for posts and telecommunications, told state radio that internet to the Horn of Africa state went down a month ago after a ship cut an undersea cable connecting it to global data networks.  

Businesses have had to close or improvise to remain open and university students told Reuters their educational courses had been disrupted.  

Anshuur said the outage was costing Somalia the equivalent of about $10 million in economic output.  

""The night internet went off marked the end of my daily bread,"" Mohamed Nur, 22, told Reuters in the capital Mogadishu.  

Nur said he now begged ""tea and cigarettes from friends"" after the internet cutoff also severed his monthly income of $500 that he took in from ads he developed and placed on the video website, YouTube.  

Somalia's economy is still picking up slowly after a combined force of the army and an African Union peacekeeping force helped drive the Islamist group, al Shabaab, out of Mogadishu and other strongholds.  

Al Shabaab wants to topple the western backed government and rule according to its strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law.  

The group remains formidable and lethal, with its campaign of frequent bombings and killings a key source of significant security risk for most businesses and regular life.  

Now the internet outage potentially compounds the hardships for most firms. Most young people who say they are unable to work because of the outage spend hours idling in front of tea shops.  

Mohamed Ahmed Hared, commercial manager of Somali Optical Networks(SOON), a large internet service provider in the country, told Reuters his business was losing over a million dollars a day.  

Hared's clients, he said, had reported a range of crippled services including passport and e-tickets printing and money remittances.  

Some students and staff at the University of Somalia in Mogadishu told Reuters their learning had been disrupted because google, which they heavily rely on for research, was now inaccessible.  

The absence of especially popular internet sites like Facebook and YouTube and Google was, however, cause for celebration for some in the conservative, Muslim nation.  

""My wife used to be (on) YouTube or Facebook every minute,"" Mohamud Osman, 45, said, adding the online activity would sometimes distract her from feeding her baby and that the habit had once forced him to try to get a divorce.  

""Now I am happy ... internet is without doubt a necessary tool of evil.""

Broadband speeds on the Channel island immediately slowed to a trickle after the data cables, owned by telco JT, and the voice traffic cable, owned by ISP Sure, were severed. Network operators rerouted data to a separate cable connecting Jersey to the main French data networks to pick up the slack, but speeds are still below their usual level.

""We are working as quickly as we can to get our undersea cables repaired, and normal service resumed, and will keep customers up-to-date with what is an extremely challenging emergency engineering operation at sea,"" said Daragh McDermott, director of corporate affairs at JT.

""It is exceptionally unlucky and unprecedented for three submarine cables to the UK to be cut in the same day, and it proves the value of having multiple links in the network, in order to provide a backup connection via France.""

The coastguard is investigating, and the ship involved was reportedly the King Arthur, an Italian-registered liquefied petroleum gas tanker. It is believed to have anchored in a restricted area over the submarine cables and then dragged its anchor over them.

Luckily the cables are in relatively shallow waters, which should make finding the broken ends relatively easy. Divers or an unmanned submersible can be used in this case. For deep ocean breaks, cable repairers have to fish around on the seabed trying to find broken cables, which can be a long and expensive process.

Once found, the fiber optic cables will be spliced together, or a new section can be glued into place on the data pipe, before the whole thing is lowered back into the water.

Work has already started to fix the cables, JT said, and the first is expected to be repaired in a week. A second cable repair ship is en route from France and should have the second cable fixed shortly, and the third should be back up and running by the end of the month. ®","The article titled ""Jersey sore: Anchor rips into island's undersea cables, sinks net access"" discusses a specific incident where a ship's anchor severed three submarine cables linking Jersey to the UK mainland.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon suffered its third day with only patchy Internet connectivity on Friday after the fiber optic cable it relies on was severed 30 miles off the coast of Egypt.

Telecoms Minister Nicholas Sehnaoui posted on his Twitter account that nearby Cyprus has agreed to reroute traffic until the cable was repaired.

“This will increase the speed back to normal all over Lebanon,” he said.

But the Internet in the capital Beirut remained slow, or not working at all, on Friday, hampering businesses that are already suffering in some places because of the threat of a spillover from the conflict in neighboring Syria.

“It is like running an engine at less than full power. A three-day outage for Lebanon is like losing 10 percent of the country’s monthly productivity, especially for a service-based economy,” CEO of private Internet provider Terranet Khaldoun Farhat said.

Farhat said the outage had been a large cost for his business. To keep providing Internet access, he has had to buy satellite bandwidth for four times the price he normally pays the government.

“This is one more disruption to economic activity that we don’t need,” said Nassib Ghobril, chief economist at Byblos Bank Group. “The telecoms sector needs to be reformed. It needs to be liberalized,” he said.

Lebanon is famed for its entrepreneurs who persevere even during the depths of war but its snail-pace and costly Internet service has been an embarrassing blot on the economy.

Ookla, a company that tests Internet speeds around the world, has often ranked Lebanon last on its global Net Index, and the country has generally been lower down than many less developed nations such as Afghanistan and Burkina Faso.

Many blame Internet problems on a backwards policy which allocates the state-owned land-line provider Ogero 80 percent of the market, pushing out private companies. The state monopoly is a significant financier for the treasury, critics say.

Farhat says Lebanon is in dire need of a backup cable.

Cyprus lies between Lebanon and the damaged section of the cable but backup lines have kept its Internet working so it can provide help for Lebanon.

**Published Date:** 01/11/2013  
**Author:** kstkadmin  

The GCI cable repair ship, Wave Venture, has been anchored outside of town since yesterday.  

Saturday’s earthquake caused a rare failure along the fiber optic cables that supply Wrangell with its television, telephone, and Internet service.  

“From Ketchikan, Wrangell, Petersburg, and up to Juneau, there’s a fiber that runs in that direction,” explains David Morris, spokesperson for GCI. “And then from Juneau it goes out into the Gulf of Alaska where it hits another fiber cable where it runs down and there’s another junction box that then breaks off and goes to Ketchikan. So that forms a ring. And the type of technology that we use, if there’s a break in any one location, the traffic is automatically routed in the other direction. And so, in theory, if you’ve got a single break, you don’t have disruption of service. What occurred here in Wrangell, though, is on the unusual side because you had multiple breaks at different locations. So that effectively isolated the island.”  

Most services were restored in Wrangell late Saturday night. However, GCI customers will continue experiencing problems and will not have full cable television access until the broken cables are re-connected.  

“So what the cable ship is doing is, they’ve sent an ROV—a remote operated vessel—down,” said Morris. “They’ve located the fiber cable. And now they’re in the process of trying to retrieve the cable. And they’ll buoy it off and then they’ll splice the sections together. And then full restoration of services will be effected in Wrangell.”  

Repairs are expected to take 24 to 48 hours once the cable is retrieved and assessed for damage.","The article discusses the failure of fiber optic cables due to an earthquake, detailing the implications on telecommunications and the repair efforts.

Published: 1 February 2017 at 9:19 pm  

Connectivity woes continue on the island nation of Madagascar, following the breakdown of an undersea cable that serves as a primary optic fiber network.  

The Telma Madagascar communications company was first alerted last Wednesday that the underwater EASSy cable that supports Internet access to the island nation was out of service. The damage, according to a company release, occurred at a depth of 2,600 meters and about 38 kilometers offshore from the southwest coastal city of Toliara.  

The company is working around the clock to complete repairs, the release said, but they are being done in stages and required equipment to be shipped from Cape Town, South Africa. The arrival of those parts on their 3,000-kilometer journey was not expected before Friday, and complete cable repairs will take an estimated total of 15 days.  

In the meantime, service to 3 million clients is compromised and the company is making business customers, schools and their websites a priority during work hours in an effort to mitigate the impacts on the economy of Madagascar. Other Telma clients have been encouraged to use communication alternatives, which the company acknowledges is an inconvenience until the complex repair process is complete.  

The EASSy cable – short for Eastern Africa Submarine Cable System – is a 10,000 kilometer cable that runs the length of the continent’s east coast. It’s the highest capacity line serving sub-Saharan Africa, and in addition to the Madagascar site, coastal connection points also are located in Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya, Somalia and Djibouti, as well as on Comoros. Those points serve a network that reaches as far inland as Khartoum in Sudan or Kigali in Rwanda, among other cities.","The article discusses a significant incident involving the break of an undersea cable, specifically the EASSy cable, which is central to internet connectivity in Madagascar.

The undersea cable market has become increasingly competitive, as large content providers build new routes and wavelength prices drop, leaving telecom operators concerned.

Google this month said it will build three new undersea cable routes to be completed in 2019, bringing to 11 the number of cables in which the company has invested since 2010.

Google's multimillion-dollar move isn't unusual anymore, even though undersea cable builds were historically driven by individual telecom operators or consortiums that then sold optical wavelength services to their customers.

The big four content providers -- Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook -- are increasingly financing undersea cable routes to enable fast, high-capacity data connections around the globe, particularly to locations where they have built data centers. Yet, these changes in the submarine networking market worry telecom operators that fear the big content providers have more money to invest in undersea cable, leaving the traditional players at a disadvantage.

Not only are 1 Gb, 10 Gb and 100 Gb wavelength service prices declining year over year, according to trend data from telecommunications research and consulting firm TeleGeography, but each time a new undersea cable goes live, 100 Gb wavelength prices drop quicker as more bandwidth becomes available at the high end of the market.

Yet, the news isn't all bad for telecom operators, according to Michael Bisaha, senior analyst at TeleGeography, based in Carlsbad, Calif. Speaking at a recent webinar, he said the big content providers shouldn't always be viewed as competitors taking over the undersea market, because they aren't always financing entire cable builds. Moreover, content providers may finance only a portion of a cable, so telecom operators have opportunities to get onto a shared cable system and use that to stretch their investment capital, he said.

> There are definitely opportunities to compete with or cater to the content players.  
> **Michael Bisaha**  

Content providers that have consistently invested in cable routes are on the routes where they have their major content hubs or cloud hubs, largely in the United States, Western Europe and some in Asia, Bisaha said. But that doesn't mean they only need primary undersea routes. They still need diverse routes, and when their needs don't meet the threshold of investing in a whole cable, they might need wavelengths or shared spectrum to specific geographies that they may buy from a telecom operator, he added.

""There are definitely opportunities to compete with or cater to the content players,"" Bisaha said, adding that content providers are primarily buying or investing in cables on the major routes that connect their primary hubs.

""The existence of one content provider on a cable doesn't necessarily preclude the need for the wholesale providers beyond those cable routes,"" Bisaha added.

**Undersea cable pricing trends**  
Apart from the influence content providers are having on the high end of the undersea cable market, the growing need for bandwidth is also driving the 10 Gb wavelength market, where prices dropped from 2014 through 2017 at an average compound annual rate of 20% to 25%, according to TeleGeography data. Bisaha said he expects the downward pricing trend to continue for both 10 Gb and 100 Gb wavelengths.

Even as 100 Gb wavelength prices drop, steeper ""shocks to the 100 [Gb] system"" tend to coincide with new content-provider-sponsored cables coming online, Bisaha said. Increased participation of content companies influences the 100 Gb market more than in the 10 Gb or the 1 Gb markets.

Still, global undersea cable prices aren't falling uniformly in all areas. Less popular subsea routes may have higher transport rates than those for major hubs. ""While the range in different geographies may indeed continue to shrink, we don't expect them to completely disappear,"" Bisaha said.

**Next Steps**  
Many enterprises are more dependent on undersea cables than they realize for remaining online and in business.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, focusing on the influence of large content providers on pricing and market dynamics.

While it does not directly mention 'cut sea cables,' it addresses the implications of undersea cable infrastructure, which is relevant to the topic.

The reliance of enterprises on undersea cables for connectivity is also highlighted, further connecting it to the criterion.

Overall, the article satisfies the criterion by discussing the broader topic of undersea cables, even if it does not specifically address incidents of them being cut."

The BBC is reporting that the ship responsible has not been discovered, and if it is, its insurance will pay for the repairs. (Otherwise JT's insurance will cover it.)

JT expects some disruption to services over the next week or so after three out of its four international submarine cables were cut yesterday evening. It is thought that the three fibre-optic cables to the UK were cut by a ship dragging its anchor along the seabed, which also cut a number of other submarine cables in its path.

KINSHASA - Africa's Internet users had something to celebrate this month. A total of 13 West African countries have just hooked up to a new underwater fiber optic cable running from Cape Town to London, bringing them better phone connections and a new high speed Internet link. But one country, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), missed the boat bringing the cable ashore.

Officially, the Democratic Republic Congo is about four months behind schedule to connect to the West African Cable System (WACS). This is not the first time the DRC has missed out on a high speed Internet link.

As Internet user Didier Bobange tries to download a document at his local cybercafé in Kinshasa, he has plenty of time to reflect on his country's position in the cyberspace race.

""So we don't know how long we wait for it to come…you know. I was in Benin Republic 10 years ago and the connection [there] was far better than we have here today in Kinshasa,"" recalled Bobange.

High speed Internet would be a blessing for Congo's businesses, researchers and even doctors who could make long distance diagnoses. It's past time they had it, says Laurent Ntumba, founder of the local Internet service provider Microcom.

""There are many [fiber optic] cables in Africa. There are maybe seven or eight, and we're not connected. It's unacceptable,"" said Ntumba.

In fact, he says, a fiber optic link between Muanda on the DRC's Atlantic coast and Kinshasa could have been switched on years ago.

""The cable from Muanda to Kinshasa [has] already [been installed] underground three years now - we can use it,"" added Ntumba.

But they cannot connect to the international line until the government has given permission, paid its dues to the cable consortium and builds a landing station at the coast. And, that is taking some time. It was a similar story in other countries, but the Congo has taken the longest time.

The immediate reason why the Congo is not linked to WACS is that the cable landing station was not built to the right standards. Local media report that the company contracted to build it had never done this kind of job before.

They also report that $3 million of government funds for the contract went missing last year and the former director-general of the national telecoms company, SCPT, was charged with high treason and jailed for three months in connection with the affair.

The scandal came to light after SCPT employees protested plans to create a private company, Congo Cable, to manage fiber optic connections.

Jean Paul Kamalata, a union representative for the telecoms sector, says this is unacceptable to cut out SCPT employees from the future revenues when they are already owed years in back pay. He also told said that the union has other valid concerns.

Kamalata says he campaigned against the plan to create Congo Cable because he believes international telecom links are vital to a country's security and you cannot entrust a country's security to a private company.

The government seems to have dropped the idea of creating a new company to manage the cable.

Microcom's Ntumba thinks it was not a bad idea in principle. He says the SCPT will need competent private sector partners to install and maintain the fiber optic network.

""Managing the cable is not something easy. You need to have the knowledge, you need all the support, and I don't know if the SCPT has this level of competence,"" Ntumba explained.

Ntumba is also doubtful about the government's plan for the next stage, which is to lay 2,000 kilometers of cable from Kinshasa to Lubumbashi in the southeast corner of the country. He suggests it would be quicker and cheaper to connect Lubumbashi to Zambia's fiber optic cable, and other eastern cities to cables from Rwanda and Uganda. The money saved could be spent on laying connections within big cities.

But many Congolese would oppose the idea of connecting eastern cities via Rwanda, a country that was at war with the DRC from 1998 to 2003.

The current director general of the SCPT, Placide Mbatika, said that deals have already been signed with Ex-Im Bank China and a Chinese contractor to lay the 2,000 kilometer cable, although there will still be a need for investors for subsequent phases.

Mbatika says the country is open to all investors for the fiber optic program. He says that thanks to President Joseph Kabila's intervention, SCPT now has political backing, competent management and a committed workforce. He predicts that the first phase of the project, landing the cable and connecting it to Kinshasa, will be finished by the end of August.

Local media say that any further delays could jeopardize the Congo's chances of hosting the next summit of French speaking countries, scheduled to be held in Kinshasa in October.","The article discusses the Democratic Republic of Congo's missed connection to the West African Cable System (WACS), an underwater fiber optic cable, and its implications for internet connectivity in the country.

Earth’s human inhabitants have grown accustomed to a globally connected world. If their power goes out, their smartphone dies while out and about, or their broadband connection goes down, they are disconnected from the rest of the world and life immediately sucks. This worldwide network of connectivity is made possible by a spider web of undersea fiber-optic cables connecting the contents and islands together. But imagine what happens when those lines are cut.

The Channel Islands, which are located within the English Channel and off the coast of France, are feeling a disconnect from the rest of the world to some degree. The three main submarine fiber-optic cables pumping communications to the islands from the United Kingdom were completely severed, leaving the islands dependent on a single submarine cable linking them to France. Thus, the Channel Islands are still connected but will experience slow speeds for some time.

JT Global is the largest service provider for Jersey, which is one of the larger Channel Islands. The company stated on Tuesday that the disruption will continue “over the next week or so,” and believes that a ship dragging its anchor along the seabed is the culprit, which apparently cut a number of other submarine cables in the process. Thus, all communications to and from the Channel Islands will be pushed through the single line connected to France until the other lines are repaired.

“With all traffic now using this connection, customers may notice some impact on services,” the company said. “JT engineers have been working on the situation throughout the night, and have already mobilized the specialist team that repairs major undersea cables. It is not possible to get a precise time yet on when those cables will be repaired, but the work will be completed as soon as possible.”

The coastguard from Jersey is currently investigating the issue. Master Pilot Peter Moore told the BBC that on Monday night a boat anchored north of Alderney — the most northern island of the group — and is believed to be the King Arthur. Moore can’t confirm if the King Arthur was responsible for the damage or not. However, he noted that ships that travel the English Channel have charts of the area that show where they cannot fish or drop anchor.

Guernsey, which is the other large island of the group, apparently did not feel the same impact. The island’s largest communications service provider Sure said on Tuesday that it is working with JT Global to reroute the latter company’s data through its network. Sure’s customers only experienced problems with international voice calls, all other communication services were unaffected.

“Sure’s multi-million pound investment in the HUGO subsea cable infrastructure operated without fault, demonstrating our ability to provide leading telecommunication services despite an unprecedented incident such as this,” Sure stated. “Our engineering teams worked through the night to put in place measures to divert our voice traffic through the HUGO network as well as to provide specialist technical support and infrastructure to JT.”

The BBC said on Tuesday that JT Global, Sure, and BT Group expects the repairs to take up to three weeks. Meanwhile, Jersey Treasury Minister Senator Alan Maclean said that the party responsible for severing the submarine lines will be held accountable for the damage. Mediterranea di Navigazione, owners of the King Arthur, have yet to comment.","The article discusses the severing of three submarine fiber-optic cables linking the Channel Islands to the UK, detailing the implications for internet connectivity and the response from service providers.

"Undersea Cables: The Unseen Backbone of the Global Internet","100-150 undersea cables cut annually, causing major disruptions to global internet connectivity.","https://www.marinetechnologynews.com/news/undersea-cables-unseen-backbone-635742","2024-04-02T00:00:00.000Z","Robin Chataut",Yes,"Robin Chataut","Easton, Connecticut, United States","4950","2024-04-02","English","Marine Technology Reporter","Have you ever wondered how an email sent from New York arrives in Sydney in mere seconds, or how you can video chat with someone on the other side of the globe with barely a hint of delay? Behind these everyday miracles lies an unseen, sprawling web of undersea cables, quietly powering the instant global communications that people have come to rely on.

Undersea cables, also known as submarine communications cables, are fiber-optic cables laid on the ocean floor and used to transmit data between continents. These cables are the backbone of the global internet, carrying the bulk of international communications, including email, webpages and video calls. More than 95% of all the data that moves around the world goes through these undersea cables.

These cables are capable of transmitting multiple terabits of data per second, offering the fastest and most reliable method of data transfer available today. A terabit per second is fast enough to transmit about a dozen two-hour, 4K HD movies in an instant. Just one of these cables can handle millions of people watching videos or sending messages simultaneously without slowing down.

About 485 undersea cables totaling over 900,000 miles sit on the ocean floor. These cables span the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, as well as strategic passages such as the Suez Canal and isolated areas within oceans.

**Laying cable under the sea**  Each undersea cable contains multiple optical fibers, thin strands of glass or plastic that use light signals to carry vast amounts of data over long distances with minimal loss. The fibers are bundled and encased in protective layers designed to withstand the harsh undersea environment, including pressure, wear and potential damage from fishing activities or ship anchors. The cables are typically as wide as a garden hose.

The process of laying undersea cables starts with thorough seabed surveys to chart a map in order to avoid natural hazards and minimize environmental impact. Following this step, cable-laying ships equipped with giant spools of fiber-optic cable navigate the predetermined route.

As the ship moves, the cable is unspooled and carefully laid on the ocean floor. The cable is sometimes buried in seabed sediments in shallow waters for protection against fishing activities, anchors and natural events. In deeper areas, the cables are laid directly on the seabed. Along the route, repeaters are installed at intervals to amplify the optical signal and ensure data can travel long distances without degradation. This entire process can take months or even years, depending on the length and complexity of the cable route.

**Threats to undersea cables**  Each year, an estimated 100 to 150 undersea cables are cut, primarily accidentally by fishing equipment or anchors. However, the potential for sabotage, particularly by nation-states, is a growing concern. These cables, crucial for global connectivity and owned by consortia of internet and telecom companies, often lie in isolated but publicly known locations, making them easy targets for hostile actions.

The vulnerability was highlighted by unexplained failures in multiple cables off the coast of West Africa on March 14, 2024, which led to significant internet disruptions affecting at least 10 nations. Several cable failures in the Baltic Sea in 2023 raised suspicions of sabotage.

The strategic Red Sea corridor has emerged as a focal point for undersea cable threats. A notable incident involved the attack on the cargo ship Rubymar by Houthi rebels. The subsequent damage to undersea cables from the ship’s anchor not only disrupted a significant portion of internet traffic between Asia and Europe but also highlighted the complex interplay between geopolitical conflicts and the security of global internet infrastructure.

**Protecting the cables**  Undersea cables are protected in several ways, starting with strategic route planning to avoid known hazards and areas of geopolitical tension. The cables are constructed with sturdy materials, including steel armor, to withstand harsh ocean conditions and accidental impacts.

Beyond these measures, experts have proposed establishing “cable protection zones” to limit high-risk activities near cables. Some have suggested amending international laws around cables to deter foreign sabotage and developing treaties that would make such interference illegal.

The recent Red Sea incident shows that help for these connectivity challenges might lie above rather than below. After cables were compromised in the region, satellite operators used their networks to reroute internet traffic. Undersea cables are likely to continue carrying the vast majority of the world’s internet traffic for the foreseeable future, but a blended approach that uses both undersea cables and satellites could provide a measure of protection against cable cuts.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, including the fact that 100 to 150 cables are cut each year, primarily due to fishing activities and anchors.

It highlights the implications of these cuts on global internet connectivity, including significant disruptions caused by cable failures.

This indicates that the article is focused on the topic of cut sea cables as a central theme rather than a minor mention."

The cable, which lies about 30 miles off the Egyptian coast, broke on Wednesday. The cable is part of the India-Middle East-Western Europe system, an 8,100-foot-long fibre-optic link between eight countries in the Middle East, Europe and Asia.

The system went live in 2009, but Lebanon didn't join the network until the summer of 2011.

During the breaks between outages, Lebanon's telecommunications minister Nicolas Sehnaoui was periodically updating Lebanese citizens on the government's progress in restoring the nation's Internet access.

On Friday, the nearby nation of Cyprus agreed to re-route some of Lebanon's web traffic in and out of the country, while Lebanon's state-run telecom provider said it would start routing traffic through a series of reserve cables, according to local news outlet The Daily Star.

Those steps were taken with the hope of returning the country's Internet to full speed, but reports from Lebanon's capital of Beirut indicate that Internet users there were still experiencing slow or completely unavailable Internet connections.

""slow is probably the best word to describe Lebanon’s Internet.""

14 May 2024  

A severe internet outage that has hit several African countries - the third disruption in four months - is a stark reminder of how vulnerable the service is on the continent.  
Questions are being asked about how the reliability of what has become an essential tool in nearly every aspect of life can be improved.  
A cut to two of the undersea cables, which carry the data around the continent, early on Sunday morning, led to the recent disruption.  
In March, damage to four cables off the West African coast caused similar problems.  
And in February, the vital links were damaged in the Red Sea after the anchor of a stricken ship dragged through three cables.  
Investigations are under way into this weekend’s case.  
But it was also likely to have been caused by “an anchor drag” from a ship, Prenesh Padayachee, chief digital and operations officer at Seacom, which owns one of the two cables affected, told the BBC.  
The second cable, known as Eassy, was affected at the same time and at the same place.  
The incident happened off the South African coast, just north of the port city of Durban, according to the Communications Authority of Kenya (CAK).  
The capacity of the infrastructure connecting Africa to the rest of the world has improved in recent years and telecoms companies are switching to other cables to maintain the service.  
In Kenya, for example, the CAK said that local internet traffic was currently using The East Africa Marine System (Teams) cable that was not affected.  
While Kenya has alternatives, other countries, such as Tanzania where connectivity levels hit 30% of what they were expected to be, do not.  
The data should be able to find other routes, but when there is a limited number of pathways the service gets jammed and slows down.  
In 2009 the Teams cable arrived in the Kenyan port of Mombasa bringing broadband connectivity to East Africa.  
Cases of cable damage are increasing but that is because the number of connections has also gone up.  
“A lot of people don’t realise that the internet is held up by these cables that are like garden hosepipes except it’s one that stretches 10,000km, and that means that they are quite fragile,” Dr Jess Auerbach Jahajeeah, a researcher into digital connectivity at the University of Cape Town, told the BBC’s Focus on Africa programme.  
Anchor dragging from ships close to shore is one of the most common causes of damage, but underwater rockfalls, as was believed to be the case in West Africa in March, and seismic activity can also affect the cables.  
As “many of these subsea cables are often quite close to each other, then one activity on the ocean floor or one ship can damage multiple cables at the same time”, industry expert Ben Roberts said.  
Repairing the damage, which requires specialised equipment and expertise, can take days or weeks, depending on the weather, sea conditions and the extent of the problem.  
It took more than a month, for example, for the four severed West African internet cables to be repaired and returned to service.  
“We are working on a temporary capacity solution to ensure connectivity is reinstated to the affected regions,” said Mr Padayachee from Seacom.  
He added that they were “actively collaborating with various parties to expedite the repair process”.  
Cable repair ship the Léon Thévenin, that had been docked in Cape Town, is being sent to the site of the damage and should be there in three days, said Chris Wood, who runs a company that has invested in Eassy.  
An internet connection has become vital for all types of businesses across the continent.  
Despite an increase in connections, Africa's reliance on a limited number of undersea cables for the internet makes the continent more susceptible to disruptions and exacerbates their impact.  
Europe and North America, on the other hand, have a dense network of high-capacity overland and undersea cables that diversify connectivity routes and improve resilience.  
While discussions have been ongoing to address Africa's internet infrastructure challenges, progress has been slow because of logistical and financial constraints.  
Dr Jahajeeah said one problem was that the support systems to repair the growing number of cables around the continent had not kept up with the growth.  
While other ships can help out, the Léon Thévenin is the only repair ship dedicated to servicing Africa.  
“The [ship] used to do two or three repairs a year [but] last year it did nine… and there is a real need for African governments and global governments to get together and say we need to ensure that there is no digital divide,” Dr Jahajeeah said.  
Some people have proposed alternatives such as satellite internet links to bolster digital resilience.  
Elon Musk's Starlink project, for example, aims to provide high-speed internet to people who live in remote areas via a network of satellites. But is very expensive and currently not available everywhere.  
The answer really lies in greater investment on the ground to support the vital communications infrastructure.  
“It needs more networks, more connectivity, more data centres and more internet exchanges to make sure that we have a diverse connectivity,” said Mr Roberts.

Graphs illustrating Syria's internet usage showed it plummeting to zero at 12:26pm local time, and it hasn't come back since.

Syria's information minister blamed ""terrorists"" - its catch-all word for rebel fighters - while the opposition accused the regime of President Bashar al-Assad of being behind the blackout. There have previously been blackouts in certain towns and areas, but never in the whole country.

""It is not true that the state cut the Internet,"" Information Minister Omran al-Zoabi told state television. ""The terrorists targeted the Internet lines, resulting in some regions being cut off.""

But doubt has been cast on that explanation by networking experts.

""Syria has 4 physical cables that connect it to the rest of the Internet,"" wrote Matthew Prince, CEO of CloudFlare, in a blog on tech site Gizmodo.

Due to rapid infrastructure and surging cloud growth, India is becoming a growing epicenter for internet traffic between Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. In line with this, the Indian Finance Minister’s concession was music to the ears. In the interim Union Budget 2024, announced by the Finance Minister on February 1, 2024 customs duty exemption was granted to vessels engaged in laying submarine cables, that lapses on March 31, 2024, was extended up to September 30, 2024. Telecom companies depend heavily on submarine cables for the high-speed transfer of data around the globe.

India’s strategic and geographic position in the Indian Ocean region has made it a critical player in the development of submarine cable infrastructure. The country is connected to the world (Asia, Middle East, Europe & Africa) through multiple submarine cable systems, such as the Southeast Asia-Middle East-Western Europe (SEA-ME-WE) cable system, the Bay of Bengal Gateway (BBG) cable system, and the India-Middle East-Western Europe (IMEWE) cable system, etc.

**2024 is set to see a** number of highly anticipated submarine cable systems worldwide go live this year. The submarine cable systems market estimated at USD 18.28 billion in 2023, at a CAGR of 12.3 percent is expected to be USD 33.29 billion in 2028.

Submarine cable systems carry over 99 percent of intercontinental communication traffic, making them the invisible enabler of global connectivity. Growing investment in high-speed internet infrastructure is driving the growth of the submarine optical fiber cable market. The continuous increase in the generation and transfer of vast amounts of data worldwide is one of the primary drivers of the market.

The high installation and maintenance costs are expected to challenge the market’s growth. Furthermore, the growing investment in satellite communications is another major factor challenging growth, as cables only have an advantage over short paths, especially if traffic is heavy. However, satellites become economically more attractive as distance increases and density decreases. Additionally, having a satellite communication link is much faster, as with the other wireless deployments, than deploying submarine cables, which is another significant advantage of satellite communications over submarine optical fiber cables.

**In the Indian region,** part of four new cable systems – 2Africa, IAX, IEX, and PEACE – are all planned to go live in 2024. Taken together with their existing cable projects, these new systems will create an interconnected backbone for international data traffic, bolstering these transport routes between Asia and the rest of the world for years to come.

2Africa is expected to be operational in 2024, with the PEARLS branch – which extends the system to Oman, the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Iraq, Pakistan, India, and Saudi Arabia – planned for service in 2025. Airtel is part of this where it has a wide-ranging partnership with Meta, covering subsea cable systems to bring 2Africa Pearls to its landing station in Mumbai. The telco planned to partner with Meta and Saudi Telecom in the venture of 2Africa Pearls extending to India.

While the India Asia Xpress (IAX) cable, expected to be ready for service later this year, and the India Europe Xpress (IEX) system, which will be ready next year. IAX will stretch from Mumbai, India, to the Maldives, and onwards to Singapore, with additional branches extending to Thailand and Sri Lanka. IEX, meanwhile, will travel westwards from Mumbai, through the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, before landing at its final destination in Savona, Italy. Reliance Jio is partners with IAX and IEX.

Occupying a crucial junction for international data traffic, linking Southeast Asia to Europe, India is a major data hub in its own right. Both APAC and Europe are already highly developed when it comes to submarine cable infrastructure, but the sheer scale of the data growth expected over the coming decade is making the further development of these state-of-the-art cables highly attractive. IAX and IEX will play a major role in meeting that need, offering customers alternatives on some of the most popular data routes in the world.

In addition, a number of new international submarine cables are in pipeline for rollout, including MIST, and TEAS, etc.

MIST, aka the Myanmar/Malaysia India Singapore Transit cable system, has a total length of 8,100km and connects Singapore, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Mumbai and Chennai in India. It is being constructed by NEC Corporation. Once fully deployed, the cable is expected to reach 11,000km and have the capacity for future expansion.

TEAS, Trans Europe Asia System is a trans-regional network that seamlessly links two new diverse connections across the Arabian Peninsula that are designed to support the future needs of key data centers, linking India, the Middle East and Europe.

NEC Corporation India (NEC India) together with NEC Corporation in January 2024 has successfully completed its optical submarine cable system in Southern India connecting Kochi and the Lakshadweep Islands. Spanning approximately 1,870 kilometres the order was awarded with a project by BSNL.

Currently, there are 17 international subsea cables (Seacom and MENA are considered separate cables) landing in 14 distinct cable landing stations in 5 cities across India, in Mumbai, Chennai, Cochin, Tuticorin and Trivandrum, and the lit capacity and the activated capacity on these 17 international subsea cables were 138.606Tbps and 111.111Tbps respectively.

There are also domestic submarine cables such as the Chennai-Andaman and Nicobar Island Cable (CANI) connecting Port Blair along with seven other Islands of Andaman & Nicobar, and the Kochi-Lakshadweep Island (KLI) cable system for a direct communication link through a dedicated submarine optical fiber cable between Kochi and 11 islands of Lakshadweep.

In a move to ease the rules for setting up submarine (undersea) cable landing stations (CLS) in India, the TRAI has made recommendations on the licensing framework and regulatory mechanism for submarine cables landing in India within existing UL-ILD/standalone ILD license, visit, [https://trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/Recommendation_19062023.pdf](https://trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/Recommendation_19062023.pdf)

**The protection of subsea infrastructure is a growing concern.** Recent disruptions either through sabotage, espionage, manipulation, or sheer accident highlight the issue and require legislative and physical protection in the Indian Ocean region.

Currently, India has 17 submarine cables landing from different parts of the world. However, India currently lacks jurisdictional, legislative, and physical protection measures for these expensive and vulnerable underwater assets. India needs to create Submarine Cable Protection Zone within India’s Exclusive Economic Zone, that is consistent with the international maritime laws, provided under UNCLOS.

A solid legislative framework would enable India to use its maritime law enforcement within these zones, as well as jurisdictional capacities for the arrest and prosecution of wrongdoers. In terms of physical protection, the repair of damaged cables is an expensive and skilled task. The rather difficult task of monitoring and protecting submarine assets in the Indian Ocean Region not only requires technical expertise but also a policy framework to ensure physical safeguards are backed up by legislation.

It will take three weeks to repair the damage. In the meantime, the Internet in Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Juba, the capital of South Sudan, is functioning at a reduced speed. It will impede the normal flow by about 20 percent, according to the BBC's Nairobi correspondent, Noel Mwakugu.

The Indian Ocean East Africa Marine Systems (TEAMS) cable, which connects East Africa to the United Arab Emirates, was severed when a ship dropped anchor in a restricted area – restricted because of the presence of the sea cabling. The Teams cable was carrying redirected traffic from the earlier cutting of three other cables in the Red Sea, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The outage comes at a time when Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, has assumed a much greater profile as a center of technological innovation and entrepreneurship, largely due to the recent availability of fast, reliable broadband connections. These undersea fiber-optic cables, laid in 2009 and which connect Africa to the world, have kicked off Kenya's high-tech industry and prompted an increase in Kenyan Internet users from 1.8 million to 3.1 million in the first year.

Bitenge Ndemo, Kenya's permanent secretary in the Ministry of Information and Communications, says that the cost of the internet outage could reach $500 million by the time repairs are finished.

""We do not have the cost yet but it runs into millions of dollars since TEAMS and EASSY carry almost 70 percent of the traffic from the East African Region,"" Mr. Ndemo told the Monitor. ""Most providers had cut off satellite thinking we have sufficient redundancy,"" Ndemo adds, and the Kenyan government has urged other new cable lines to land elsewhere to prevent future line cuts in the high-traffic sea-lanes outside Mombasa.

In the meantime, Kenya's losses have been significant. ""There have been major disruptions and loss of revenue in the past few days,"" Ndemo says. ""In my estimation we shall have lost up to $500 million by the time we are reconnected.""

Jessica Colaço, the manager of iHub, a high-tech incubator in Nairobi, estimates that the cut in Internet service will affect an estimated 10,000 people in Nairobi who work in the tech industry. All of those people, along with larger companies who have started to locate in the city -- such as Google, Microsoft, and Samsung -- will suffer the frustration of a substantial slow-down until the cable is repaired.

In addition to work taking longer, and therefore costing more, a slowing in the rate of information carried online could also cause multiple websites and online services to ""time out.” A time out is a limit on the duration allowed for an online instruction to be followed and is configured on a server-by-server or client-by-client basis. A time out will require a user to begin the process of retrieval again (and again). In many cases, users will never access the information at all, bringing work to a standstill for the duration of the repair.

“It is difficult to make an exact analysis [of the effects], because one cannot be sure about the amount of redundancy that is built into most of the operator networks to deal with something like this,” Paul Kukubo, CEO of Kenya’s ICT Board, said by email. “As we write this I am able to communicate because my service provider obviously has another network to route through.

“But the visible effects are that there has been a considerable slowdown on some Internet network speeds. Some service providers have been affected in terms of quality due to this, especially because the TEAMS networks provide high speed broadband that many have come to depend on. We have seen some slowdown on some government networks as well,” Mr. Kukubo said. “The providers assure us that this is a rare occurrence and because East Africa has 3 cable connections, and one was unaffected by the cut, we are lucky to have this redundancy on our undersea cables.”

Computer users are used to the Internet malfunctioning, of course. But for most, malfunctions rarely can be traced to a single act of negligence, or greed, by a named individual. The Mombasa anchor episode, in this sense, resembles an incident in which an Armenian retiree in the Caucasian nation of Georgia brought down the Internet. Hayastan Shakarian, a retiree living in Georgia, wound up cutting the connection to three Caucasian countries with a shovel while searching for copper wiring to steal in the hills.

As with the shovel incident, the Mombasa anchor incident is an unwelcome reminder that the high-minded world of technology remains vulnerable to physical human error.

Johannesburg, 29 Feb 2012

Damage to undersea broadband cable Eassy is likely to be repaired by 20 March, says the chief executive of a company that is the largest shareholder in the network.

The 10 000km Eassy cable, which stretches from Sudan to SA, suffered a cut on 17 February between Djibouti and Port Sudan, says Chris Wood, CEO of West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC), which has an almost 30% stake in the network.

Wood says the rest of the cable is still functioning because its “collapsed loop network configuration” allows for the internal re-routing of traffic when a break occurs. The WIOCC chief executive also says the fault on Eassy did not have “much impact” on its customers either, as the vast majority of its data traffic exits Africa through Djibouti.

However, it was not only the Eassy cable that was sliced.

The SMW3 and EIG networks, used by Eassy to carry traffic from Africa to Europe, were damaged just north of Djibouti in what appears to have been part of a single incident.

“It is believed that a cargo ship dragged its anchor over a distance of some 150km in the Red Sea, cutting all three cables one after the other,” notes Wood.

“Most Eassy owners also own capacity on other systems and have in-built redundancy in their networks. As such, most of the Africa to Europe traffic affected by the cuts to SMW3 and EIG has already been re-routed onto other systems, both in Djibouti and via South Africa,” Wood adds.

WIOCC says the SMW3 cable could be repaired by 12 March, a fix that could restore most of the affected traffic on its direct path to Europe. The company also says the EIG cable could be repaired by the same date as the Eassy cable, 20 March.

### Piracy threat?

The damage to all three cables, though, occurred in and around the area of the Red Sea, which has experienced problems of piracy - a factor that could potentially delay repair times, according to experts.

“It's a very dangerous spot to ever park a ship,” says JP Viljoen, a systems engineer at Neology, a wholesale bandwidth provider to ISPs in Africa.

The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Commercial Crime Services said on 15 February it received information that in the Bab El Mandeb Straits of the Red Sea “seven pirates in two skiffs... chased a chemical tanker”. The ICC Commercial Crime Services also said that in the same area of the Red Sea, on 27 February, the crew of a bulk carrier in the strait reported sightings of nine skiffs approaching their boat aggressively.

On both occasions, the alleged pirates aborted their attacks, according to the reports.

But Mike Last, director for marketing and international business development at WIOCC, says: “I don't think piracy is an issue with this.”

He notes that the time-scale of the planned repair is dependent on issues such as securing permits, sailing time and weather conditions. He says a ship from the Middle East is going to be sent to fix the cable. He did not specify when that ship would be sent exactly.

### Destructive anchors

Meanwhile, reports have emerged in the last few days that The East African Marine System (TEAMS) 5 000km undersea fibre-optic cable, stretching from Kenya to the United Arab Emirates, was also cut by a ship's anchor in the Kenyan port of Mombasa.

The disruption caused a 20% slowdown in Internet speeds in Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, Ethiopia and South Sudan, the BBC reported.

Wood says the Eassy cable is functioning normally from Mombasa.

He adds that some TEAMS owners are in the process of re-routing their traffic onto the Eassy system in Mombasa, to reduce the impact in Kenya and other countries in East Africa while the repair to TEAMS is undertaken.","The article discusses the cutting of three undersea cables, specifically mentioning the Eassy, SMW3, and EIG cables.

Preliminary submarine cable prospectus released on 5th July  
RCOM released the preliminary prospectus for the listing of its cable  
as a business trust in Singapore last week. At this stage the  
pricing hasn’t been determined, but press articles indicate a pricing  
range of USD1.09-1.32 per unit, with an implied market cap of USD1.27-  
1.54bn. The prospectus states a payout of at least 90% of distributable  
free cash in dividends and projects USc12.5 for FY13F. This implies a  
9.5%-11.5% yield at the offer price indicated as per press, which is  
attractive vs the average telco yield of 6-7% across the region. However,  
this pricing range also implies a listing EV/EBITDA of ~10-12x FY13F  
(on pro-forma EBITDA forecast of USD131mn with no debt at end of  
FY12F). Hence, we recommend some caution, and also given the lack of  
clarity/ inconsistency around group strategy, a ~10% yield alone may not  
be enough to entice many investors. We are, in general, positive on  
submarine cable businesses given their inherent cash/margin potential,  
but we don’t have enough comparables/ details to assess the merits of  
this transaction yet. (Source: Reliance’s GTI Said to Offer Up to 11%  
Yield in Singapore, Bloomberg, July 9 2012).

Positive catalyst, but only the first step to deleveraging  
A listing of its submarine cables assets could be a positive catalyst for  
RCOM given its many attempts to monetize its various assets. However,  
if we assume a 65% divestment in cables (or roughly US$1bn proceeds  
based on price indicated by press), and these proceeds are used to  
reduce debt at RCOM level, gearing still remains high at close to 5x on  
our estimates.  
Key highlights from the preliminary prospectus  
• RCOM has created the Global Telecommunications Infrastructure  
Trust (GTI Trust), which now owns the submarine cable assets. This  
trust released the preliminary prospectus for an IPO listing in  
Singapore.  
• Total number of units after the IPO is expected to be 1,163mn and  
RCOM could potentially look to divest 55-65%, we understand, based  
on press reports, which highlight a price range of USD1.09-1.32 per  
unit. This implies a market cap in the range of USD1.27-1.54bn.  
• As per the prospectus, the trust expects to at least distribute 90% of  
cash flows to unit holders. For FY13F, USc12.5 per unit is estimated to  
be distributed. This implies a yield in the range of 9.5-11.5%, based  
on above mentioned unit price range. However, these are preliminary  
estimates at this stage and are also subject to actual performance of  
the company (share price).  
• As per pro forma statements, GTI Trust has no debt as on March  
2012. This would imply a FY13F EV/EBITDA multiple of 10-12x (based  
on FY13F pro forma projections provided in the prospectus). This  
compares to the current regional average of 6-7x.

We believe a 55-65% divestiture could reduce RCOM’s debt levels by  
USD700mn-1bn. RCOM’s net debt at the end of March quarter stood  
at USD6.5bn, with net debt-to-EBTIDA of 5.5x. If we assume USD1bn  
in proceeds were to lower debt, we estimate net debt to  
EBITDA could fall close to 5x.","The article discusses RCOM's submarine cable assets in detail, mentioning them directly and treating them as a central theme.

Johannesburg, 22 Feb 2012  

Undersea broadband cable Eassy, which connects countries along Eastern Africa to high-speed Internet, has been damaged, resulting in minor service disruption.

The 10 000km cable, stretching from Sudan to SA, experienced a cut between Djibouti and Port Sudan, according to Chris Wood, chief executive of West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC), the largest shareholder in Eassy with a 30% stake.

He further says the fault has only resulted in minimal disruption owing to Eassy's collapsed ring protection system that allows for internal re-routing of traffic.

A WIOCC representative further told ITWeb that the company is currently not in a position to give an exact date for when the repair of the fault is to be completed.

“The only services affected are those either originating or terminating in Port Sudan, or those using Port Sudan to connect to other systems for transit to Europe.

“As the vast majority of Eassy's traffic exits through Djibouti, most customers have not felt the impact of the cut to Eassy,” Wood adds.

Africa's growing number of undersea cables means incidents of service disruptions, especially as a result of ships dropping anchors on cables, are increasing.

Two years ago, Africa's Seacom undersea cable, which also connects the east coast of Africa, experienced a similar cut that took almost three weeks to repair.

With more undersea broadband cables connecting Africa having come online, such as the West Africa Cable System, businesses that rely on the networks say they are mitigating service disruption risks by using a number of different cables.

Graham Beneke, systems engineer at Neology, wholesale bandwidth provider to ISPs in Africa, says the latest Eassy cut has not really affected his company's operations. “We have capacity on all the other undersea cables as well.

“By having one cable running up the east coast, and by having one cable running up the west coast, the same ship is unlikely to cause a fault on both cables simultaneously,” he adds.","The article titled 'Eassy cable damaged' provides a detailed discussion on the damage to the Eassy undersea cable, including its location and the implications for internet service in the region.

It mentions the cut specifically, discusses the minor service disruptions caused, and compares this incident to past events involving other undersea cables, thus providing context and relevance to the topic of cut sea cables.

This aligns well with the evaluation criteria, as it treats the subject as a central theme rather than a minor mention."

Schuld daran ist ein Anker, der auf ein Unterseekabel in Kenias Hafen Mobasa krachte.

Im Jahr 2009 wurde das Unterssekabel im Hafen von Mombasa verlegt.

KAMPALA _taz_ | Wer dieser Tage in Ostafrika zur Bank geht, um Rechnungen zu bezahlen, muss sich gedulden: „Tut mir leid, unser System funktioniert über das Internet und das ist dieser Tage sehr langsam“, seufzt der Bankangestellte. „Wir entschuldigen uns für die Unannehmlichkeiten“, erklären die zahlreichen Telekommunikationsfirmen Ostafrikas in Emails und Textnachrichten an ihre Kunden. Twitter und Facebook-Nutzer von Burundi bis Südsudan beschweren sich lautstark über die Langsamkeit ihrer Internetverbindungen. You-Tube Videos ansehen ist schier unmöglich.

Der Grund: Eines der Breitbandkabel, das Ostafrika mit der Welt vernetzt, ist kaputt. Vergangenen Samstag ließ ein Schiff Anker außerhalb von Kenias Hafen Mombasa. In vier Kilometer Tiefe krachte der tonnenschwere Haken auf das 2009 verlegte Kabel. Sechs Länder gingen komplett offline. Selbst Telefonanrufe und SMS funktionierten in Ruanda, Uganda, Burundi, Tansania, Äthiopien und Südsudan stundenlang nicht.

Ostafrikas Telekommunikationsfirmen schalteten ihr System notgedrungen wieder auf Satelliten-Verbindung um. Seitdem öffnen sich Webseiten nur noch in Zeitlupe – auf rund 20 Prozent der bisherigen Geschwindigkeit, so wie noch vor drei Jahren, als Ostafrika noch nicht an das Unterseekabel angeschlossen war.

Bis zu drei Wochen werde die Reparatur des Kabels dauern, erklärte Joel Tanui, Manager der Firma East Africa Marine System (TEAMS), die das Kabel betreibt. Sie gehört einem Konsortium aus mehreren weltweit agierenden Telekommunikationsfirmen und Kenias Regierung. TEAMS will nun ferngesteuerte U-Boote zu Wasser lassen, um das Kabel zu heben und es zu reparieren.

Das beschädigte Kabel ist eines von drei Unterseekabeln, welches Ostafrika mit dem weltweiten Netz verbindet: Es führt vom Hafen Mombasa in Kenia bis nach Fujairah in den Vereinigten Arabischen Emiraten. Von Mombasa aus wurden in den vergangenen zwei Jahren Breitbandverbindungen ins Innere des Kontinents verlegt: nach Uganda, Ruanda, Burundi und Südsudan – wo nationale Netzbetreiber derzeit dabei sind, Anschlüsse bis in die abgelegenen Dörfer hin auszubauen.

Das streckenweise parallel verlaufende EASSY-Kabel führt von Sudans Hafenstadt Port Sudan die ostafrikanische Küste entlang bis nach Südafrika und verbindet die ost- und südafrikanischen Länder sowie Madagaskar mit dem TEAMS-Kabel. Zehn Tage vor dem Anker-Unfall in Mombasa wurde das EASSY-Kabel im Roten Meer ebenfalls beschädigt.

Das dritte Kabel, SEACOM, streckt sich von Zafarana nach Ägyptens Hauptstadt Kairo bis zum Horn von Afrika. Von dort führt ein Strang bis zu Indiens Hafenstadt Mumbai und der andere entlang der Ostküste nach Südafrika. Das TEAMS-Kabel schließt an die SEACOM-Verbindung an. Die SEACOM-Betreiberfirma verschickte dieser Tage Presseerklärungen, um deutlich zu machen, dass ihre Verbindung nicht lahm gelegt wurde. Zahlreiche Telekommunikationsfirmen bemühen sich derzeit, ihre Verbindung über das SEACOM-Kabel umzuleiten.

Seit die Unterseekabel 2009 online gingen, hat sich in Ostafrika vieles rasant verändert. Der Transfers von großen Datenmengen ist seitdem in kurzer Zeit möglich. Dies hat die Wirtschaft extrem angekurbelt. Seitdem eröffnen in Ostafrika an jeder Straßenecke Internetcafes. Restaurants und Kneipen bieten kostenfrei W-Lan an. In Ruanda kann man sogar landesweit via W-Lan online gehen.

A few days ago, a ship dragging its anchor severed an underwater fiber-optic cable carrying data from Kenya to United Arab Emirates. The result: Internet and mobile phone outages for people in more than half a dozen countries up and down the coast. And it's not the first time one of these data pipelines has taken a hit. Here to talk more about the incident and the underwater world of data is Solomon Moore. He's the East Africa correspondent for the Wall Street Journal. He's based in Nairobi. Welcome to the program.  

SOLOMON MOORE: Thank you.  

CORNISH: What more can you tell us about what happened here?  

MOORE: Kenyan officials say that a ship was dragging its anchor off the coast of Mombasa, Kenya, and severed an Internet and phone link that hits land at that point and then goes under the sea and connects Africa to the rest of the world via Internet and phone.  

CORNISH: And I gather that this isn't the first time.  

MOORE: This isn't the first time that a cable such as this has been cut, but what is unusual about this situation is that this particular cable - it's called the TEAMS cable. It's The East African Marine Systems. Internet traffic and phone traffic was being rerouted through this line because, 10 days earlier on February 17th, three other crucial cables were also severed in a different place off the coast of Djibouti.  

CORNISH: This cable was just a few years old, but there are all kinds like it all over the world connecting places, you know, as far as New York and France, Colombia and Florida. Describe how these pipelines work, maybe what they look like.  

MOORE: So these are not the kinds of cables that you'd see kind of lining the road. These are undersea cables. They're coiled in kind of a steel armor. They're fiber optic, each strand of fiber optic wire about the diameter of a human hair, and they're capable of carrying millions of phone calls and data connections at once.  

And they're unspooled by cable ships across the ocean floor. The depth of these cables is the main thing that protects them, but also the armor that they're sheathed in.  

CORNISH: Solomon, how has this affected life there? I mean, it seems to somehow showcase how fragile this infrastructure is.  

MOORE: Well, you know, these things happen. I mean, cables have been severed before. When the tsunami hit Japan, that resulted in Internet cables being severed. It's disrupted a lot of commerce here. Africa is not as wired as many parts of the world, but more and more businesses are sprouting up. Some of the most prominent businesses on the continent are involved in eCommerce and rely on these Internet and phone connections for millions of links with the world outside of Africa and within the continent.  

CORNISH: Lastly, how soon will this underwater cable be repaired? And how do they actually go about doing it?  

MOORE: What we're being told is it's going to be three weeks of slow Internet, intermittent service, a lot of cost to businesses that need the Internet and these phone links. What that entails - the repair will entail ships going to these areas where the wires have been severed, submerging submarines, unmanned submarines, to go down and inspect these cables. Then submarines to bring them up to the surface, where they'll be reattached in a clean environment aboard these cable ships.  

Then they'll be submerged again and, hopefully, everything will be back in working order in about three weeks' time.  

CORNISH: Solomon Moore, thank you so much for talking with us.  

MOORE: You're welcome.

The ongoing Internet blackout in Syria this week, like the one that occurred in Egypt early in 2011, prompts curiosity as to whether such an event could happen in one's own country. Here's one measure that gives a rough idea of how difficult it would be for your government to legally shut down the Internet.

First, it should be explained that the cutoffs in Syria and Egypt weren't the result of a physical disconnection, like bombing the cables or cutting the power to servers or relay stations. A country can take itself off the map largely by removing itself from the Domain Name System and Border Gateway Patrol, the software and databases that tell computers and servers how to contact one another.

In other words, a ""kill switch"" for the Internet might be as simple a thing as directing DNS providers to delist or send false information (more easily done when they are run by the state), which could isolate the country from the rest of the online world with a few keystrokes, and restore it just as easily. This method is consistent with the way in which Syria dropped offline, although a government spokesperson has reportedly claimed that the rebel faction was responsible and had cut the cables.

Renesys, an Internet monitoring and analysis company that provided insight during the disconnection of Egypt, gathered some data how resistant different countries are to a wide-scale shutdown. The company says that one way of measuring the robustness of a country's networks is by looking at the number of Internet service providers (ISPs) that have direct connections to other ISPs outside of the country. The more external connections, the more resistant the country is to shutdown.

Larger countries, of course, have more ISPs, for example, with one serving the North, one serving only the big cities, one primarily working with businesses, etc. But smaller countries and those with totalitarian or unstable regimes may have very few, or even just one official ""outside line.""

The submarine cables connecting Syria with neighboring countries.Renesys

Again, this doesn't necessarily mean physical lines; many ISPs may share the same fiber backbone that connects, say, Greece and Turkey. Above, for instance, you can see that Syria is connected to neighboring countries by several submarine cables. If two ISPs share a line and only one is forced to cease operating, in most cases the other can keep working. On the other hand, if multiple lines are under the authority of just one provider, that makes shutdowns far easier.

Countries with only one or two ""frontier"" providers include Libya, Ethiopia, Myanmar and, unsurprisingly, Syria. Places like Greenland and Madagascar are also at risk: Their geographic isolation and smaller populations make multiple external connections difficult and in some ways unnecessary.

Renesys's map of shutdown vulnerability based on frontier connection providers (darker green is higher risk).Renesys

On the other side there are the countries that should be highly resistant to shutdown: the United States, Canada, most of Europe, and Australia number among the 32 countries with 40 or more frontier providers. So while Americans may understandably be concerned with issues like Net Neutrality and monopolistic practices, it would be comparatively difficult for the government to cut off the country from the rest of the world.

This is only one way to look at risk and security, however. Physical infrastructure could also be destroyed or rendered inoperable in several ways and at several points. While this method is far less likely to be used by governments (which have likely invested in that very infrastructure), an attacker would feel no such compunction in bombing a transatlantic cable or removing power to a major switch facility.

The outage in Syria is ongoing; Renesys and other Internet companies like Akamai are monitoring and reporting on the state of the country's connectivity, which no doubt depends heavily on the outcome of the current armed conflict.

Devin Coldewey is a contributing writer for NBC News Digital. His personal website is coldewey.cc.","The article discusses the implications of internet shutdowns in Syria and mentions 'submarine cables' in the context of Syria's connectivity.

It explains that while shutdowns were not primarily due to physical disconnections, the mention of submarine cables and their role in connectivity is relevant to the topic of cut sea cables.

The article treats this information as significant, thus satisfying the criterion."
"Profitability of Globe-Encircling Fibre Optic Cable Business for RCom, Tata, and Airtel","Examines the financial performance of submarine cable operations, detailing their critical role in global internet connectivity and market dynamics.","https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/is-globe-encircling-fibre-optic-cable-business-making-money-for-rcom-tata-and-airtel/articleshow/12666982.cms?from=mdr","2012-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","Avinash Celestine",Yes,"Avinash Celestine","Mumbai, India","146667","2012-04-15","English","Bennett, Coleman & Co. Ltd.","It is one of the sad-but-true facts of business that what you build, or make, may be absolutely critical to the survival of a hugely successful or important industry, but you yourself don't really make much money off it. The cheapest iPad costs around $600 but the Samsung processor which runs it, and without which the iPad is just a pretty, but useless slab of metal and glass, costs around $14 — about 2% of the market price. Prices of potatoes have jumped sharply in recent weeks, but rest assured that the farmer who actually plants and harvests it will get a small percentage of the final price you pay, with middlemen capturing the rest. And so it is, with submarine cables.

As of 2010, there were about 1.1 million km of fibre optic cables laid across the world's oceans and circling the globe, according to Terabit, a telecom consulting company.

And despite all the talk of 3G, 4G and the fights between telcos and regulators about who gets how much spectrum at what price, the internet couldn't function without the wired part of it. Click on a link while surfing the internet on your smartphone, and pretty much the only 'wireless' aspect is the data sent by your phone to the cell tower and service provider's telecom switch.

If you're in Mumbai, and you click on a link of a website hosted on a server in the US, the signal likely travels through fibre optic cables through the ocean floor off the coast of Mumbai, through West Asia, Europe, and across the Atlantic to the US east coast. Or it could go the other way, through Chennai, Singapore, Tokyo and across the Pacific to the US west coast. It's the same story if you text someone in London, or call someone in Tokyo.

RCom owns about 65,000 km of such undersea cable, much of which it acquired in 2003 at the tail end of the dotcom bust by buying FLAG Telecom for fire-sale prices. A year or so later, the Tatas bought Tyco, another high-profile casualty of the bust and acquired another several thousand km of fibre optic cable (both own many more tens of thousands of kilometres of cable laid on land).

Between the two, they now own 20% of the total length of fibre optic cables on the ocean floor and about 12% of high-capacity bandwidth (defined as 1 million Mbps or more — your home broadband connection is probably a couple of Mbps) capacity across the globe, according to Terabit. A third player, Airtel, is part of various consortia which collectively own another 225,000 km of cable (again, it has several thousand more kilometres of cable on land).

As owners of submarine cables, RCom, Tata and others like them are essentially the wholesalers of internet bandwidth — selling capacity in bulk to internet service providers around the world who then sell it to you and me. The undersea cable business of RCom has 386 customers comprising mobile operators, internet service providers and other big telecom companies.

RCom is currently 'evaluating' a listing of its submarine cable business in Singapore. No numbers have been released officially, but the media speculation is that the company is hoping to raise Rs 7,500 crore, possibly more, by selling off 75% of the business. Most of that money will be used to repay part of a crippling debt burden of Rs 39,000 crore.

This is not the first time that RCom has talked of listing FLAG. In 2007, it had initiated the process of doing so, on the London Stock Exchange, with the proceeds to be used to expand the cable network.

Given that it has been a critical part of the one of the biggest boom industries over the last generation or so, how profitable has it been for the likes of RCom and others, to own all this wiring?

The roots of the current fibre optic cable system go back to the dotcom boom. Over half of the 1.1 million km of cable currently deployed, entered service in 1999-2002.

""Ten to fifteen years ago, people invested in submarine cables on the basis of applications that had yet to be built,"" says Sunil Tagare, founder of buysellbandwidth.com, who, in an earlier avatar, was one of the pioneers who developed and implemented the FLAG system in the late 1990s, which Reliance later bought (Tagare declined to talk about FLAG to ET on Sunday). ""They were building for applications like movies and video on demand, which eventually did materialise of course, but took a much longer time to do so, than expected.""

Then came the bust and the beginning of a decade-long collapse in the value of internet bandwidth. Prices in some cases, fell by nearly 80% between 2003 and 2010. Wide disparities in wholesale prices remain though — according to Telegeography, a telecom market research and consulting firm, an Mbps of bandwidth in mid-2011 cost as low as $1 a month or so in New York or London (for what the industry calls 'GigE' port prices). In Sydney that price was around $90. Even in Mumbai, it was around $40 per month.

Cable owners, far from being deterred by the price collapse, have continued to add to capacity. This was because it was cheap to do so. Technological innovation meant that existing cables could be upgraded to handle much greater capacities than they were originally built for — and for a fraction of the cost of a new cable. FLAG for instance, was originally built to handle 2.5 Gbps of data flowing through it (2,500 Mpbs). New technology meant that this capacity could be increased by many multiples of that — as much as 16 times of original capacity if not more.

Indeed RCom, which owns cables well over a decade old (the life of a cable is about a quarter century) and which were built to handle much smaller capacities, touts this ability to upgrade as a big competitive advantage. In a presentation released earlier this week about the FLAG business, it argues that it costs $50-75 million to upgrade a cable from 10Gbps to 40 Gbps against the cost of building a new cable which can be as high as $800-900 million.

And that doesn't even take into account the paperwork needed for a new cable — regulatory clearances for instance, and negotiating with governments to set up a landing station (where the cable emerges from the depths of the ocean onto land). ""The technological change which enables such upgradation of capacity has contributed to making the cost of an Mbps of bandwidth much cheaper,"" says an industry executive. If true, this is a big barrier to entry in favour of RCom. Incidentally, of the total installed capacity on RCom's submarine cable network, only about a third is actually being used at present.

But barriers to entry or not, new cables continued to be built. Of the 44 high-capacity systems currently in existence, 25 were built after 2003. Driving the expansion in capacity is a huge burst in demand for bandwidth driven by the trends we are all now familiar with — the expansion of smartphones and tablets bringing with them new (and bandwidth hungry) ways of accessing the web, the demand for streaming video, and the move towards remote 'cloud' storage of data and applications, rather than on, say, your local hard disk. The total international internet bandwidth, according to Telegeography, doubled in the past two years to 55 million Mbps (55 terabits). That is further expected to reach 200 terabits by 2015.

But driving new increases in cable capacity are also the changes in the geography of the internet. ""The shift in the global economic order in the last decade or so has meant that there is a growing demand for bandwidth in countries such as China, Brazil, India and the Asian region,"" says Abhijit Barua, senior vice-president of Sify Technologies. Cable investments in these regions in the years ahead are likely to increase. In recent years, Reliance Globalcom (a Bermuda-based company which houses RCom's undersea cable assets) has completed FALCON, a 10,300-km cable linking India to West Asia.

There may be an excess capacity of bandwidth (currently) in absolute terms, but think about this. For an email to go from Australia to India, it is often first routed to California, and then back across the Pacific to India. There are many cities in Asia which are only linked to each other through the US because of a lack of direct cable links. The US still acts as a major clearing house for internet communications — though that importance will decline as investments in new cable routes are made.

""It was a good idea for Globalcom to focus on being a strong player in developing markets, particularly the Middle East, where growth has been extremely rapid and there is less competition than on other regions where Reliance has cables, like the trans-Atlantic or NE Asia,"" says Alan Mauldin, research director of Telegeography.","The article discusses the business of submarine cables owned by companies like RCom and Tata.

Ars looks at how Egypt ""turned off"" the Internet within its borders and …

How hard is it, exactly, to kill the Internet? [Egypt seems to have been able to do it.](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/01/amidst-chaos-and-riots-egypt-turns-off-the-internet.ars) But Egypt's situation isn't exactly the same as that in the Western world. And even though Egypt only has four big ISPs, the fact that everything went down after midnight local time suggests that it took considerable effort to accomplish the 'Net shut-off. After all, it seems unlikely that President Hosni Mubarak ordered the Internet to be shut down as he went to bed; such a decision must have been made earlier in the day, and then taken hours to execute.

Also, the fact that such a drastic measure was deemed necessary may indicate that more targeted measures, such as blocking Twitter, didn't get the job done. This nuclear option—see below—was intended to make online coordination of anti-government action impossible; at the same time, the mushroom cloud may give protesters hope that their efforts are not in vain. As one blogger [writes](http://cheeptalk.wordpress.com/2011/01/28/cutting-off-communications-in-egypt/): ""It's as if the regime has done the information aggregation for you and packaged it into a nice fat public signal.""

### Cables and routing

But back to the ""how,"" and ""would this also work in a Western democracy?""

The easiest way to disconnect a country from the Internet is to cut the cables that leave the country. Egypt has a bunch of sea cables that go across the Mediterranean to Italy, and a few others that visit other Mediterranean destinations. Other cables run through the Red Sea towards east Africa and in the direction of India and beyond.

I haven't seen any maps with cables that cross the border toward neighboring countries—it's much easier to pull fiber through the sea than through the desert. Interestingly, it doesn't look like the connections that run through Egypt have been affected. This traffic typically traverses the country without ever leaving the fiber, so it remains oblivious to the turmoil going on in Egypt. The fact that traffic between Europe and Asia is unaffected means the fiber optic cables themselves weren't cut.

The only thing we know for sure is that quite suddenly, almost all the Egyptian IP address ranges fell off the 'Net, as [reported](http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/01/egypt-leaves-the-internet.shtml) by Renesys. The Renesys post talks about BGP prefixes disappearing. That could be either cause or effect. A prefix is simply BGP-talk for a range of IP addresses. For instance, the range 192.0.2.0-192.0.2.255 is the prefix 192.0.2/24. The number after the slash indicates how many bits are part of the prefix. The remaining bits are to be filled in later. [BGP](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596002541/), the Border Gateway Protocol, is a [routing protocol](http://arstechnica.com/security/news/2008/01/internet-routing-growing-pains.ars) that is used between the routers on either side of the border between two ISPs—""gateway"" is an old-fashioned word for ""router.""

What BGP does is ""advertise"" the local address prefixes to neighboring networks. Wholesale ISPs propagate their customer's advertisements to their neighbors so that eventually all ISPs know all other ISPs' prefixes. This enables routers to know where to send packets with a given destination address. The 3,500 Egyptian prefixes are now no longer advertised, so they're missing from the routing tables of BGP routers around the world. This means that routers no longer know where to send packets addressed to IP addresses that fall within these prefixes—even if all the cables are still working fine.

However, it seems unlikely that the Egyptian ISPs removed 3,500 prefixes, if only because that means removing 3,500 lines from router configurations. Usually, two or three routers advertise a prefix—more is overkill, but less is dangerous because if the advertising routers go down, the addresses fall off of the 'Net. An easier way would be to make a filter that simply doesn't allow any outgoing BGP advertisements.

It could also be that the big ""border"" routers that the Egyptian ISPs use to connect to ISPs in Italy and elsewhere were disconnected or turned off. This works well in a relatively small country with only a few ISPs.

When the border routers are turned off or lose their connection to the outside world, an ISP's network becomes isolated from the rest of the world. However, that doesn't necessarily mean _local_ connectivity is disrupted. Egypt has an Internet exchange, and many ISPs have direct interconnections. The connections between different ISPs are also governed by BGP, which requires extensive manual configuration. Disrupt the border routers, or the fibers that BGP knows about, and two ISPs can't exchange traffic anymore.

Breaking international connections wouldn't necessarily kill the connectivity between the four large Egyptian ISPs—that would require a separate action. But in a country like Egypt, with one very large city and a handful of ISPs, that number of connections between ISPs should be fairly small and therefore easy to disrupt. This is especially the case of an Internet exchange: just turn off the exchange's Ethernet switches.

Within an ISP's network, the routing protocols IS-IS and OSPF are used. Unlike BGP, IS-IS and OSPF don't require much, if any, configuration. They will simply make use of any connectivity that's available and automatically advertise address blocks within the local network. To really make it impossible for any two users of the same ISP to talk to each other, it's necessary to shut down—or at least disable the routing protocols—on _every_ router.

Of course just being able to talk to people that are connected to the same ISP as you isn't _that_ useful—especially if there's no DNS. Turns out that there are three DNS root servers in Egypt, so there is a possibility that they could keep internal connectivity going without relying on the outside world. The root servers are the first step in resolving domain names into IP addresses. The next step is talking to a top level domain server, and finally talking to the DNS server of the domain in question. So this only works for top level domains and domain names for which the nameservers are located within the country. The three nameservers for Egypt's .eg top level domain are located in Vienna, Seattle, and Cairo. For any content hosted within the country, it would make sense for the DNS servers to be located in Egypt, too.

But obviously, keeping local connectivity up and running would defeat the purpose. Unlike BGP and IS-IS/OSPF, the DNS in general, and root servers in particular, provides a nice central place where it's easy to disrupt the network. In the case of the US or Europe, that wouldn't be as easy, because both have dozens of root servers, and they're run by 13 different organizations.

If the DNS is still working to some degree, it's also necessary to get packets from one ISP to another. Egypt has an Internet exchange in Cairo. It's unclear whether the four big ISPs in Egypt connect with each other through that exchange, but generally ISPs don't like to use international connections for national traffic. So it's likely that they interconnect in or around Cairo.

### Could this happen elsewhere?

Like in Egypt, in Europe almost all interconnection happens in the capitals of the countries involved. Not so in the US: because the country is so large, and traffic volumes are so high, large networks may interconnect in as many as 20 cities. Numerous intercontinental sea cables land in the Boston, New York, Washington DC, Miami, Los Angeles, and Seattle regions. So in Egypt or many medium-sized countries, killing the connections between ISPs wouldn't be too hard. In the US, this would be quite difficult.

Assuming someone in high places has an Internet kill switch, shutting down just the international connections would require a lot of manual work, or the preexistence of an infrastructure that can make this happen automatically through management protocols. Of course such a system would never be triggered by accident or by a disgruntled employee.

The old story that the Internet was built as a military network to withstand nuclear attacks is pretty much an urban legend, but despite that, it's surprisingly hard to kill. It can be done, however, if you're a government and you try really, really hard.","The article discusses the importance of sea cables in maintaining Internet connectivity, specifically mentioning Egypt's undersea cables to Italy and other Mediterranean destinations.

It explains how cutting these cables can effectively disconnect a country from the Internet, making this topic a central theme of the article.

The implications of such actions on Internet connectivity are explored in detail, fulfilling the criterion for being on the topic of cut sea cables."
"NEC Achieves 4Tbps Transatlantic Speed Record","4Tbps data transmission speed set over submarine cables, enhancing transatlantic internet connectivity.","https://www.extremetech.com/internet/113137-nec-sets-4tbps-transatlantic-speed-record","2012-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","",Yes,"Sebastian Anthony","New York, New York, United States","7500","2012-01-11","English","ExtremeTech","NEC has broken the ultra-long haul internet speed record by transmitting 1.15 terabits per second with a single laser over a distance of 10,000km (6,213 miles). In total, four lasers were used simultaneously to transmit 4Tbps down a single optic fiber.

Unfortunately NEC's press release is light on details, but it seems like the engineers used fairly standard tech to achieve this new speed record. Each laser encodes its data using orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) superchannels (the same technique used by DSL, WiFi, and more), and then four of these ""superchannels"" are multiplexed into a single cable using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM -- the same technique currently used to squeeze multiple optical channels down a single fiber). We're not entirely sure, but the novel innovation here is probably the use of OFDM with optical signals. The work was carried out by NEC's research group in Princeton, New Jersey, which is close to the landing point of numerous transatlantic cables.

Faster speeds have been transmitted over fiber in recent years, but only over very short distances -- and short distances aren't really a problem, as far as the internet goes. The significance here is the _distance_ of NEC's transmission speed record: 10,000km is long enough to span the Atlantic or Pacific. Submarine cables are incredibly expensive and difficult to lay, and really, where possible, you want to make the most of existing infrastructure instead of laying a new cable -- which is exactly what NEC's technology promises to do.

The current state-of-the-art for transoceanic connectivity is between 10 and 100Gbps per optical fiber. The fattest cable in the world, the TGN-P which spans the Pacific between Japan and the USA, currently maxes out at around 7Tbps, which means it has around 150 ""lit"" fibers. The key behind NEC's discovery is that it can be used on existing fiber optic networks -- and so in this case, if the routers on either end of TGN-P were upgraded with NEC's technology, the cable's total capacity would jump from 7Tbps to 150Tbps or more.","The article discusses NEC's achievement in transmitting data over long distances and mentions submarine cables in the context of internet connectivity.

Seacom Ltd., the South African company that controls the cable, detected a fault on Saturday, Chief Digital Officer Prenesh Padayachee said in an interview with Bloomberg on Monday. He estimated the problem is in waters about 150 meters (492 feet) to 170 meters deep in an area where Iran-backed Houthi fighters have been targeting ships with drones and missiles.

The incident highlights how vulnerable critical subsea infrastructure can be, particularly in shallow waters with lots of cables. There are approximately 16 cable systems in the Red Sea, connecting Europe to Asia via Egypt.

While Seacom was able to quickly re-route internet traffic onto alternative cables, it now has to figure out the logistics of repairing a cable in a war zone, according to Padayachee. The company is working with a cable repair company owned by Emirates Telecommunications Group Co. PJSC on a plan, including how to insure the repair ship and whether they’ll need military escorts or armed security.

“A pending cease-fire in the region may provide a good window for the repair,” Padayachee said.

Houthi militants have made threats to sabotage critical undersea cables on social media, but there’s no evidence to suggest they have been successful. The vast majority of cable damage is caused by fishing equipment such as trawler nets or anchors dragging on the sea floor, according to data from the International Cable Protection Committee.

Eight West African countries were suffering a second day of major connectivity issues on Friday with users in South Africa also affected, after damage to four sub-sea cables. The cause of the cable cutting was still not known, though a shifting of the seabed was among the likely possibilities.

""Repairs can take weeks to months, depending on where the damage is, what needs to be repaired, and local weather conditions,"" said a spokesperson at internet analytics firm Cloudflare. ""The assignment of repair ships depends on a number of factors, including ownership of the impacted cables.""

The West Africa Cable System, MainOne, South Atlantic 3 and ACE sea cables — arteries for telecommunications data — were all affected on Thursday and Friday.

MTN Group Ltd. – one of the largest wireless carriers in Africa – said that ACE and WACS have jointly initiated the repair process, and that they would send a vessel to fix the damaged cables.

Orange Marine said the firm was one of the specialist companies that would be involved in the repair operations for the cables, adding that other companies are also involved in efforts to restore the various cables. It said the repair time is not yet known.

Data show a major disruption to connectivity in eight West African countries, with Ivory Coast, Liberia and Benin being the most affected, NetBlocks, an internet watchdog, said in a post on X. Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon are among other countries impacted. Several companies have also reported service disruptions in South Africa.

Ghana’s main stock exchange extended trading hours by an hour on Thursday and Friday, while Nigeria’s second-largest cement maker scrapped a call with investors as the damage to four subsea cables off the west coast of Africa, stymied businesses across parts of the continent.

""This is a devastating blow to internet connectivity along the west coast of Africa, which will be operating in a degraded state for weeks to come,"" said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis firm Kentik.

Ghana’s National Communications Authority said cable disruptions also occurred in Senegal and Portugal.

""This has led to a significant degradation of data services across the country, with mobile-network operators working around the clock to restore full services,"" the authority said.

The cable faults off Ivory Coast come less than a month after three telecommunications cables were severed in the Red Sea, highlighting the vulnerability of critical communications infrastructure. The anchor of a cargo ship sunk by Houthi militants was probably responsible, according to assessments by the US and cable industry group the Internet Cable Protection Committee.

The Red Sea is a critical telecommunications route, connecting Europe to Africa and Asia via Egypt.

Together, the problems with cables on either side of the continent create a capacity crunch, with customers of those cables scrambling to find alternative routes.

Microsoft Corp. reported disruptions to its cloud services and Microsoft 365 applications across Africa.

The Downdetector website showed that a number of companies in South Africa were still severely affected on Friday, including Microsoft and Nedbank Group Ltd.

Telkom SA SOC Ltd.’s Openserve fiber unit and Standard Bank Group Ltd. were also affected, they said in statement, with Openserve adding it had re-routed traffic.

Off the southeastern coast of South Africa, the island country of Mauritius also experienced outages, with Mauritius Telecom Ltd. having to arrange to redirect traffic to other cables, it said.

Last year, WACS, along with another pipe – the South Atlantic 3 – were damaged near the mouth of the Congo River following an undersea landslide. The loss of the cables knocked out international traffic traveling along the west coast of Africa and took about a month to repair.","The article discusses significant disruptions to internet services in Africa due to damage to multiple undersea cables.

"$1.5 Billion Investment to Reduce London-Tokyo Latency by 60ms","$1.5 billion investment in new submarine cables cutting latency by 60ms between London and Tokyo, enhancing connectivity and redundancy.","https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/122989-1-5-billion-the-cost-of-cutting-london-toyko-latency-by-60ms","2012-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","",Yes,"Sebastian Anthony","New York, New York, United States","7500","2012-03-20","English","ExtremeTech","Starting this summer, a convoy of ice breakers and specially-adapted polar ice-rated cable laying ships will begin to lay the first ever trans-Arctic Ocean submarine fiber optic cables. Two of these cables, called Artic Fibre and Arctic Link, will cross the Northwest Passage which runs through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. A third cable, the Russian Optical Trans-Arctic Submarine Cable System (ROTACS), will skirt the north coast of Scandinavia and Russia. All three cables will connect the United Kingdom to Japan, with a smattering of branches that will provide high-speed internet access to a handful of Arctic Circle communities. The completed cables are estimated to cost between $600 million and $1.5 billion each.

All three cables are being laid for the same reasons: Redundancy and speed. As it stands, it takes roughly 230 milliseconds for a packet to go from London to Tokyo; the new cables will reduce this by 30% to 170ms. This speed-up will be gained by virtue of a much shorter run: Currently, packets from the UK to Japan either have to traverse Europe, the Middle East, and the Indian Ocean, or the Atlantic, US, and Pacific, both routes racking up around 15,000 miles in the process. It's only 10,000 miles (16,000km) across the Arctic Ocean, and you don't have to mess around with any land crossings, either.

The massive drop in latency is expected to supercharge algorithmic stock market trading, where a difference of a few milliseconds can gain (or lose) millions of dollars. It is for this reason that a new cable is currently being laid between the UK and US -- it will cost $300 million and shave ""just"" six milliseconds off the fastest link currently available. The lower latency will also be a boon to other technologies that hinge heavily on the internet, such as telemedicine (and teleconferencing) and education. Telephone calls and live news coverage would also enjoy the significantly lower latency. Each of the fiber optic cables will have a capacity in the terabits-per-second range, which will probably come in handy too.

Beyond the stock markets, though, the main advantage of the three new cables is added redundancy. Currently, almost every cable that lands in Asia goes through a choke point in the Middle East or the Luzon Strait between the Philippine and South China seas. If a ship were to drag an anchor across the wrong patch of seabed, billions of people could wake up to find themselves either completely disconnected from the internet or surfing with dial-up-like speeds. The three new cables will all come down from the north of Japan, through the relatively-empty Bering Sea -- and the Arctic Ocean, where each of the cables will run for more than 5,000 miles, is one of the least-trafficked parts of the world. That said, the cables will still have to be laid hundreds of meters below the surface to avoid the tails of roving icebergs.

Each cable will be laid by a pair of ships: an ice breaker that leads the way, and a cable ship. Until now it has been impossible to lay cables in the Arctic Ocean, but the retreat of the Arctic sea ice means that the Northwest Passage is now generally ice-free from August to October; a big enough window that cable can be laid fairly safely. Existing cable ships (and there aren't many of them) are all outfitted for balmier climes, so all three cables will require the use of a polar ice-rated ship that has been retrofitted to carry cable-laying gear.","The article discusses the laying of new submarine fiber optic cables across the Arctic Ocean, specifically mentioning Arctic Fibre, Arctic Link, and ROTACS.

"Impact of Submarine Cable Cuts on Egypt's Internet","Egypt lost 70% of its Internet connectivity due to the cutting of two submarine fiber-optic cables in the Mediterranean Sea.","https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/networking/how-the-internet-went-out-in-egypt","2011-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","Written by",Yes,-,"New York, NY, United States",-,"2011-01-28","English","ZDNet","We think of the Internet as universal. We think of it in terms of a utility like electricity or water. It's none of those things. In some countries, like the U.S., it would be very hard to 'turn off' the Internet. In places like Egypt, though, with a limited number of Internet backbones and a handful of Domain Name Service (DNS) servers, it's easy. Here's how it appears the Egyptian government turned their country's Internet off.

First, here are some bare basics on how the Internet works. Every time you go to a Web site, you use its domain name such as Yahoo, ZDNet, etc. to find it. That's not what the Internet's software uses though to hook you up to a Web site. Instead, your network connection uses address resolver software to look up the site's IP (Internet Protocol) address at a DNS server from the natural language address you've given it work work with. DNS is the Internet master address list. With it, instead of writing out an Internet IPv4 address like ""http://209.85.135.99/,"" one of Google's many addresses, you can simply type in ""http://www.google.com"" and you'll be you on your way. But, DNS can only work if it has the right address information in it.

One of the things that Egypt has done to block out the Internet is remove access to its DNS servers. As Mark Hoffman of the Internet Storm Center explained, ""From an IT security perspective how do you shut down a country? From what I can see for us external to the country access to the DNS servers is removed.""

Hoffman used the Unix/Linux dnstracer command, which determines where a given DNS server gets its information from, and then follows the chain of DNS servers back to where they got their address information from. He found, as I did too when I tried, that you can only follow the Egyptian sites addresses so far and then the full address resolution process breaks down.

In short, you can't currently get the Internet IP addresses for most Egyptian Web sites. In Egypt, the reverse is true. They can't get to the right Internet addresses of the world's Web sites.

There are ways to get around that kind of DNS trouble though. For example, all the Egyptian government's Web sites are under the Internet's IPv4 address range: 81.21.104.0/24. So, you might think you could get to an Egyptian government Web site using an address such as 81.21.104.1. No, that won't work either. Here's why.

Egypt didn't stop with just locking down its DNS servers. The Egyptian government has also, according to BGPmon.net, a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) monitoring and analyzer software company, appears to have ordered ""ISPs to stop routing all networks.""

Specifically, before the shutdown ""There were 2903 Egyptian networks, originated from 52 ISPs. Transit was provided via 45 unique ISPs. Today at 2am UTC, the numbers look quite different, there were only 327 Egyptian networks left on the Internet. These were originated by 26 ISPs. So 88% of the Egyptian networks is unreachable!""

How was Egypt able to do this? It didn't take much. Egypt has only a handful of high-bandwidth Internet backbones entering the country. You may recall that in 2008 Egypt briefly lost 70% of its Internet connectivity when a mere two submarine fibre-optic cables in the Mediterranean Sea were cut by accident.

As Craig Labovitz, chief scientist for Arbor Networks, a network security company, explained in an AP interview that since Egypt only had a few major Internet pipelines, ""It's probably a phone call that goes out to half a dozen folks who enter a line on a router configuration file and hit return. It's like programming your TiVo--you have things that are set up and you delete one. It's not high-level programming.""

With the erosion of net neutrality and certain misguided efforts to try to give the Federal Government to create some kind of Internet kill switch, it may be a different story tomorrow. People who think that giving our government might want to consider how well it's worked out for Egypt. Yes, Egypt has prevented protesters from organizing over the Internet, but how would you feel if you could no longer talk to your friends or get news over the Internet? Even if you were politically indifferent wouldn't you be more worried, upset and angry than ever?

I believe that in disconnecting their people from each other and the world, the Egyptian government instead of smothering the fires of discontent has poured gasoline on the flames instead. Indeed, as I write this, the ruling party headquarters in Cairo has gone up in flames.","The article discusses the shutdown of the Internet in Egypt and specifically mentions that 'Egypt briefly lost 70% of its Internet connectivity when a mere two submarine fibre-optic cables in the Mediterranean Sea were cut.'

The Yemeni government has granted permits for the repair of two out of three cables, but refused the third because of a dispute with one of the cable’s consortium members.

Repairs to the Seacom and EIG cables have been approved, but the consortium that runs AAE-1, which includes telecommunications company TeleYemen, was not granted a permit by Yemen’s internationally recognized government, according to documents seen by Bloomberg.

Three out of more than a dozen cables that run through the Red Sea, a critical route for connecting Europe’s internet infrastructure to Asia’s, were knocked offline by the Houthi-sunk Rubymar vessel in late February. Although the telecommunications data that passes along the damaged cables was re-routed, the incident highlighted the vulnerability of critical subsea infrastructure and the challenges of making repairs in a conflict zone.

The dispute over the third cable derives from the split political control of TeleYemen, the country’s sole telecommunications provider, a reflection of the country’s broader geopolitical divisions. The company has two branches, one in Aden under control of the internationally recognized Yemeni government, and the other in Sanaa under the control of the Houthi militia group. The Yemeni government refused to cooperate with the Houthi-linked part of TeleYemen associated with the AAE-1 cable consortium and sought to appoint a representative from the Aden branch, according to the documents. But the consortium didn’t approve the alternative representative and Yemen’s government declined to grant a permit, according to the documents.

E-Marine, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi-based Emirates Telecommunications Group Co. PJSC, is contracted to carry out the repairs.

The Aden branch of TeleYemen, affiliated with the Yemeni government, wrote a letter to Yemen’s Telecommunications Ministry demanding that E-Marine provide a £10 million ($12.5 million) bank guarantee to ensure it would not carry out any repairs on the AAE-1 cable when the company was fixing the other two cables until the dispute was resolved. The ministry initially approved the condition, according to the documents, but Yemen’s cabinet decided it wasn’t necessary, a senior government official told Bloomberg.

It’s unclear if the Houthis, an Iran-backed militia group which controls much of Yemen’s Red Sea coastline, including the key port of Hodeida, will let E-Marine fix the two cables. The group, which has been attacking ships in the area with drones and missiles for months, has previously said only it can grant permission for the repairs.

The repair ships will take about a week to reach the cables and then approximately two days to fix each one, according to Seacom Ltd.’s Prenesh Padayachee. The cables will be lifted to the surface and fresh cable will be spliced in to replace the damaged sections.

The repair crew will also assess the Rubymar, the Houthi-sunk ship whose anchor most likely severed the cables in February. Seacom estimates that the ship is currently about 1 kilometer away from its cable, Padayachee said, and seems to be stable.

""But we don’t want to do a repair and then have this vessel falling into the new cables,"" he said. ""In all likelihood it will have to be moved.""

The three damaged cables carry about 25% of traffic in the region, according to estimates from Hong Kong-based internet provider HGC Global Communications, which uses the cables.","The article discusses the situation surrounding the repairs of submarine internet cables damaged in the Red Sea, detailing the implications of the damage on internet connectivity and the geopolitical challenges affecting the repair process.

This kind of thing happens from time to time, but Saturday’s incident represents a particular stroke of bad timing. The cable severed was already overworked, rerouting data from three other cables that were accidentally severed a week prior in the Red Sea. All said, these fiber-optic channels are the backbone of East Africa’s telecommunications infrastructure. Now one single undersea fiber-optic link is left to carry the entire load for all of East Africa, slowing internet connections in Rwanda, Kenya, Burundi, Ethiopia, Tanzania, and South Sudan by 20 percent until repairs are made, a process that could take weeks.

Before plugging into the high-capacity subsea fiber optic network three years ago, most Internet traffic in East Africa moved through expensive satellite connections or painfully slow telephone lines. Since then economies in the region have come to rely on their increased connectivity, so this weekend’s incident comes dangerously close to spelling a small economic disaster. It also raises a larger question: Why, when global economies and day-to-day life are so reliant on access to the Internet, are we still relying on these seemingly vulnerable undersea cables, these accident-prone physical “tubes” connecting continents across the oceans? Why, in a world that’s increasingly wireless, are we still so wired? Isn’t there a better way to connect the globe?

The answer is: Not really. Fiber optic communication, for all of its shortcomings, is actually pretty amazing, and it’s getting better by the year. Accidents do happen. In 2006 earthquakes in the Luzon Strait near Taiwan severed seven of nine cables and wrought havoc on communications networks for weeks, and twice in 2008 cables in the Mediterranean were damaged, disrupting communications in the Middle East, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent (and that’s just two recent examples–there are many, many more). But there’s really no technology that can touch our current fiber optics technology. The solution to problems like those East Africa is currently experiencing is not less fiber optic cable, but more.

“It’s amazing that we’re reliant on these physical links, but the reason we are is because of the kind of quantum leaps that fiber optic technology offers,” says Andrew Blum, author of the forthcoming book _Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet._ The physical cables running along (and sometimes under) the seabed carry huge volumes of data in the form of light, orders of magnitude more data than can be packed into radio signals that might be beamed wirelessly via satellites or antenna towers. The idea of replacing those cables with some kind of through-the-air technology is tempting, but for the foreseeable future we’re stuck with fiber optics.

Fiber optic cables carry orders of magnitude more data than can be beamed wirelessly “The problem is that the volumes of data we’re talking about require a very wide spectrum of frequencies,” Marvin Sirbu, professor of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, says. “And in order to get a wide spectrum of frequencies you need to get into very high-frequency electromagnetic waves. Light waves are very, very high-frequency. If you look at the frequencies we normally think of as radio waves, to find that much spectrum you’d have to be at frequencies so high that–like light–they fade in fog or in rain, and therefore can’t really be used to go to a satellite and back, or even over long distances on the ground.”

Instead, Sirbu says, we put those high-frequency signals into optical fiber in the form of light. The fiber is extremely transparent so the signal doesn’t fade over distance. There’s no fog or rain or other atmospheric moisture inside to interfere with the signal, so it maintains its integrity whether traveling across the room or across the Pacific. When you run out of capacity, you lay a new cable. Or, even better, you can dial up the capacity in the cables already laid.

This is where fiber optics creates those “quantum leaps” forward, says Blum. The standard operating unit for fiber optics right now is something like 10-gigabits per second. But new optical modules that are being swapped into common systems boost that capacity to 40 or even 100 gigabits per second. The same cables can then carry ten times more capacity, growing the system without laying a single new cable on the seafloor. Other tricks–involving everything from new ways of channeling signals to implementing lenses known as “time telescopes” to manipulate light pulses–could potentially keep that capacity growing at a rapid pace for the foreseeable future.

The key to averting disasters like the one East Africa is flirting with is redundancy, Sirbu says. “If you look at the U.S., we have cable landing sites at many different places, from Florida to Maine and all up and down the West Coast as well,” Sirbu says. “Given the interconnection of networks around the world, if fiber going into one landing location is broken there is fiber landing at other locations that will still be operational. But Africa is probably the continent least densely served by fiber optics, especially when compared to Europe, North America, or East Asia. They’re in a riskier position.”

That’s a problem for East Africa, particularly in a situation like this wherein two separate incidents have severed two of the three main fiber optic nerves feeding data into and out of the region. And while it seems that vulnerable undersea cables are the cause of the region’s current connectivity woes, the key to ensuring that East Africa doesn’t find its communications infrastructure hanging by a single fiber optic thread ever again–to ensure it doesn’t end up temporarily back in the days of dial-up and satellite signals–is route diversity. In other words, the answer is more fiber optics cables, not fewer.

“These cuts are always exciting because these are the moments that remind everyone that the cables are there,” Blum says. “This cut in particular is more exciting because it’s the first time you really get to see what it means for East Africa to have fiber when three years ago it didn’t. So I optimistically look at it upside down. Its only the incredible capacity of fiber optic technology that has allowed the Internet to progress across the world. You wouldn’t have this global Internet without fiber optics–that’s what’s so amazing about it.","The article discusses the severing of undersea cables, specifically detailing an incident that disrupted internet connectivity in East Africa.

With the threat of today's protests looming in Egypt, on Thursday Egyptian authorities cut the nation off the internet. No online communication could pass in or out of the country. We investigated whether a similar lockdown could happen in America.

**How the Egyptian government erased its citizens from the internet**  
No one is completely certain what happened to the Egyptian internet, but it appears that the shutdown started off early in the week with the country blocking Twitter and Facebook access for those within its borders. Then, shortly after Thursday midnight local time, the country simply disappeared from the internet. With a few exceptions like the stock exchange, Egyptian websites and services were unreachable; the network traffic over Egyptian borders dropped by an astonishing 90 percent. Cell phone networks were also down. Today Vodafone confirmed that all mobile providers been ""obliged"" by the Egyptian government to shut off service to customers in that country.

How did it happen? Most likely, according to experts, the Egyptian authorities made a few phone calls to the country's handful of large internet service providers. Their request would have been simple: Make it impossible for Egyptians to communicate with other countries and each other using the internet. But carrying out this order isn't like hitting an off switch.

To erase Egypt, those providers would have to corrupt routers, nodes in the internet which direct data traffic. Each router helps traffic along by advertising the many IP addresses it knows using a system called border gateway protocol (BGP). When you visit a website in Egypt, your internet provider uses BGP to ask an Egyptian router, ""Hey, how do I get to this Egyptian blog?"" The router responds by using BGP to send you on your merry way to the right address. BGP is basically the border language that helps different parts of the internet speak to each other.

But early Friday morning, thousands of routers in Egypt had their minds wiped. Suddenly they had no idea where anything was on the Egyptian internet. When your internet provider looked for web addresses inside Egypt, it found nothing. Egyptian routers no longer gave meaningful answers to BGP requests for border crossings.

James Cowie of network analysis firm Renesys observed the Egyptian shutdown as it happened. He wrote yesterday in a blog post:
> Renesys observed the virtually simultaneous withdrawal of all routes to Egyptian networks in the Internet's global routing table. Approximately 3,500 individual BGP routes were withdrawn, leaving no valid paths by which the rest of the world could continue to exchange Internet traffic with Egypt's service providers. Virtually all of Egypt's Internet addresses are now unreachable, worldwide.  
This is a completely different situation from the modest Internet manipulation that took place in Tunisia, where specific routes were blocked, or Iran, where the Internet stayed up in a rate-limited form designed to make Internet connectivity painfully slow. The Egyptian government's actions tonight have essentially wiped their country from the global map.

**Could the same thing happen in America?**  
Egypt's internet infrastructure is quite sophisticated, and it's one of the most highly networked countries in its immediate region. Still, it was relatively easy to take the country off the net because it had a limited number of network providers. In addition, the Egyptian government has broad powers over its communication, which is why a company like Vodafone has to cut off its millions of Egyptian customers when the government comes knocking.

Despite these differences, it's very possible that Egypt's swift shutdown of its country's internet could provide a model for American governments of the future.

Alex Stamos, a computer security expert with iSEC Partners, said he'd spoken recently with U.S. officials about this possibility in the event of an internet-based attack on America. (Full disclosure: iSEC Partners has done work for io9's parent company, Gawker Media.) Stamos thinks the U.S. probably wouldn't take the country off the internet, but instead try to prevent Americans from reaching ""enemy"" countries or regions online. He said via e-mail:
> I wouldn't be shocked if the US didn't have a gameplan to make China, Russia, North Korea and/or Iran go away in case of WWIII. The first step would be to have major US networks (UUNET, Level3, Sprint, AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, Google, BT) advertise these countries' IP ranges and ""null route"" the resulting packets, meaning throw them away.

He said that shutting down the internet within U.S. borders would be ""almost impossible,"" but:
> The government certainly could force AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile to turn off wireless IP routing and for Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, Charter, Time Warner and the other consumer ISPs to basically shut down their networks or at least their edge routers. It's unlikely that the government would be able to force every small ISP and college to stop their peering, and corporations and other customers with multiple ISPs would still have connectivity.

I also spoke with network expert Matthew Ringel, a former network engineer with Tufts University who has worked extensively with BGP routers. When I asked whether he thought the US government could imitate the Egyptian model, he was dubious - but only about their ability to do it as swiftly as Egypt did. Given how complicated the US internet is, he said, ""In the immediate term [shutting it down would be] very hard, bordering on impossible, but you could do it in a few days to a week.""

Both Ringel and Stamos agreed that another possibility would be to cut off physical access to the internet.

There are only a limited number of cables leading out of the U.S. to other parts of the world (see cable map above). Physically cut them and you've got what network geeks call ""an air gap."" No network traffic can cross the empty air between the cable's severed ends.

**But wouldn't it be illegal for the U.S. government to shut down the internet?**  
All the scenarios for shutting down the American internet involve some degree of collusion between the government and private companies who provide internet access to millions of people in the U.S. But could the government really make AT&T shut off your network and phone? Wouldn't that be illegal?

For now, as long as the president doesn't declare martial law, it would be. There are a number of laws that protect internet service providers from government control. But that could change very soon. Several bills have been working their way through Congress that would give President Obama ""kill switch"" control over the internet during a ""national cyber-emergency.""

CNET's Declan McCullagh has been following the bills, first proposed by Senator Joe Lieberman and Senator Susan Collins. This week, he reported that the bill has been revised and is picking up steam:
> The revised version includes new language saying that the federal government's designation of vital Internet or other computer systems ""shall not be subject to judicial review."" Another addition expanded the definition of critical infrastructure to include ""provider of information technology,"" and a third authorized the submission of ""classified"" reports on security vulnerabilities.

The idea of creating what some critics have called an Internet ""kill switch"" that the president could flip in an emergency is not exactly new.

A draft Senate proposal that CNET obtained in August 2009 authorized the White House to ""declare a cybersecurity emergency,"" and another from Sens. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.V.) and Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) would have explicitly given the government the power to ""order the disconnection"" of certain networks or Web sites. House Democrats have taken a similar approach in their own proposals.

Such a bill would allow the President to order shutdown of the American internet without any checks from the Judiciary.

This is something that worries digital liberties groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Eva Galperin, an activist with the group who works on international issues, emphasized that Obama might be closer than we think to having a kill switch for the American internet. In a statement, she said:
> What's going on in Egypt highlights the risk of granting any leader, up to and including the President of the United States, unilateral power to shut down portions of the internet. There have been a couple of bills in Congress which we read as potentially giving the President broad and vague powers to take emergency steps to protect the US in case of a ""cyberemergency"" declared by the president. Any such bill would have to be narrowly tailored for a specific threat, with review by congress and the courts.

All these legal niceties and predictions may not matter if the U.S. government perceives itself as under threat. As Galperin put it, ""If the US government actually severs cables in order to cut off internet access in the US, then they have lost all regard for the rule of law and all bets are off.","The article discusses the implications of physically cutting cables that connect the U.S. to the global internet, mentioning that doing so would create an 'air gap' and prevent network traffic.

Although it does not use the specific terms 'cut sea cables' or 'undersea cables', it addresses the topic of severing physical connections and its impact on internet connectivity, fulfilling the criterion's requirements."

Internet service providers serving Africa have been forced to send their traffic via elaborate detours following damage to four major subsea cables off the continent’s west coast last week.

Some telecommunications companies are bypassing the cables by going via Brazil, according to one of the cable operators. Others have shifted their traffic overland onto a web of cross-border terrestrial cables.

It’s a patchwork job that’s dramatically improved connection issues for millions of customers after the West Africa Cable System, MainOne, South Atlantic 3 and ACE sea cables – arteries for telecommunications data running along the coast — went down last week. But the re-routing, sometimes via lower-capacity cables, has left many countries with slower internet speeds.

“The only way to get the African network back to the normal status quo is to repair those four severed cables,” said Roderick Beck, a consultant who sources network capacity for telecommunications clients. “Those cables provide most of the direct connectivity to most West African countries.”

The cause of the faults hasn’t been determined, but a preliminary analysis from MainOne suggested seismic activity on the seabed that may have led to an undersea landslide. The company estimated that it would take between three and five weeks to restore connectivity.

Widespread outages hit at least eight West African countries, including Nigeria, the continent’s largest economy, and were felt as far away as South Africa, which relies on the cables for international data transfer. Ivory Coast, Liberia and Benin were the most affected, impacting everything from international phone calls to local money transfers and e-commerce.

By Tuesday, connectivity levels had been mostly restored, but “service quality remains diminished in some of the affected countries,” NetBlocks said.

Many companies shifted their traffic to the high-capacity Equiano cable, which also runs along the coast, but is only directly connected to Togo, South Africa and Nigeria. Others have turned to Angola Cables, whose SACS cable runs from Angola to Brazil and from there the company can send data to the US and Europe.

**Internet Slowdown**  
Ghana’s National Communications Authority said in a statement that it was allocating the “limited bandwidth currently available” to key businesses, including public utilities and banks.

“Communicating through emails has been a challenge, the completion of a number of deals has been delayed and it’s been difficult to make payments to clients making withdrawals to meet emergencies,” Nana Kofi Agyeman Gyamfi, head of wealth management at Bora Capital Advisors Ltd. in Accra, said.

Nigeria’s National Communications Commission said in a statement on Monday that data and voice services had been restored to “approximately 90% of their peak utilization capacities.”

Ivory Coast’s Digital Economy Minister Ibrahim Kalil Konate said that although internet services were “functional,” capacity would not be fully restored until the cables were repaired, which he said he hoped would be completed by early April.

**Repair Plans**  
Cable repair company Global Marine’s CS Sovereign vessel, currently in port in Portland, England, and Orange Marine’s Leon Thevenin, currently docked in Cape Town, South Africa, will be loaded up with fiber optic cable before heading to waters off the Ivory Coast to investigate and repair the undersea cable problems. Telkom, one of South Africa’s biggest internet providers, expects the repairs to take about three weeks, depending on weather conditions.

A spokesperson for Orange Marine confirmed that it would assist in the repair operation, but declined to comment further. A spokesperson for Global Marine declined to comment.","The article titled 'Africa Internet Outage Sends Traffic on Winding Trip Around the World' discusses significant damage to four major subsea cables—West Africa Cable System, MainOne, South Atlantic 3, and ACE—off the west coast of Africa.

It highlights the impact of these cable outages on internet connectivity, stating that internet service providers have had to reroute traffic through Brazil and other terrestrial cables due to the damage.

The article emphasizes the urgent need for repairs to restore normal internet service, which has been affected across multiple West African countries.

This strong focus on the implications of the cut sea cables and their central role in telecommunications data transfer clearly satisfies the criterion for being an article on the topic of cut sea cables."

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Did you ever wonder how people in Japan connect to websites hosted in San Francisco? Or how a New Yorker can Skype with a friend in Sydney?

It sounds crazy, but Earth's continents are physically linked to one another through a vast network of subsea, fiber-optic cables that circumnavigate the globe. Cords no thicker than your home's broadband connection stretch along the bottom of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans; through the Suez canal; across the Mediterranean Sea and around the coasts of Africa and South America.

Indian telecom giant Tata, one of the world's largest subsea cable providers, manages 130,500 miles of fiber sitting at the bottom of the ocean floor. That's enough to circle the planet five times. It takes a ship six weeks just to load the cable for a cross-ocean voyage.

Why is all that underwater cable necessary? It's a matter of speed, and laying in enough safeguards to ensure that the Internet won't suddenly go down.

Subsea fiber-optic cables can tie two giant centers of commerce together, reducing data traffic delays. Three companies are in the process of building cable networks that link London directly to Tokyo -- through the polar ice cap -- with cables capable of 10 gigabit-per-second speeds. (That's 2,000 times faster than your home Internet connection).

Those cables could reduce the Internet's latency by about 60 milliseconds between those two points.

That's an imperceptible lag for the average Internet user, but it's an eternity for high-speed stock traders. They can make or lose millions of dollars in that span of time.

It's not just financial institutions, which make up a very small portion of total Internet usage, that are interested in faster speeds. Internet service providers like Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner Cable (TWC) like to go zoom as well, because it gives them capacity to meet the growing demands on their networks.

Subsea cables have the added benefit of being shielded from wind, trees, storms and other destructive forces. They don't require massive towers to carry them, like over-the-land cables do.

They're literally just laid on the bottom of the sea, and once placed there, they can more or less be left untouched for a quarter century.

But sometimes cables get cut, particularly in shallow water. They get accidentally clipped by ship anchors about twice a year.

It happened most recently a month ago, when a ship dropped anchor off the coast of Kenya and cut Internet service for much of the country. Google noticed a steep drop in availability of its services in Kenya on Feb. 25.

That's why cables are outfitted with GPS, so ships can find and patch them when they break. There are outsourced companies on the clock 24/7 to do repairs at a moment's notice.

Having multiple cables connecting continents from many different locations means the Internet is less likely to be massively disrupted when a cable is snapped.

That's why Tata says it was critical to build the final leg in the world's first round-the-planet network, which it completed last week. The final cable connects Mumbai to Marseille, France. Tata's other links tie the United Kingdom to New Jersey, Spain to Africa and Japan to Australia.

Together, those pipes handle 25% of the world's Internet traffic. Tata wouldn't put a price tag on the project, but an under-construction arctic cable linking Asia, North America and Europe has an estimated cost of $1.5 billion.

The upshot of all that investment is that if one cable snaps, you'll still be able to play ""Words with Friends"" with a partner 10,000 miles away.

Ironically, the monster that grew from that idea known as the World Wide Web is actually very, very fragile. They didn't anticipate what the Internet would become--because they weren't fucking insane--and as a result, the whole operation now sits on a rather shaky foundation.

5 The Internet is a Series of Cables, and Cables Can be Cut
-----------------------------------------------------------

Considering how much people freak out when a single big site goes down (everyone remember the Great Gmail Outage of '09?) it's clear that most of us think of the Internet in general as pretty much invincible. If an asteroid smashed into the Earth tomorrow, millions of us would immediately pull out our phones to try to get Twitter updates from the affected area.

But the truth is, the Internet travels from continent to continent by way of a network of trans-oceanic cables, each thousands of miles long and only as thick around as a thumb. If enough of these high-pressure porn hoses were compromised, international Internet communication could collapse entirely.

Since these cables are the backbone of a huge portion of the global economy, they must be pretty well protected, right? Guards in armored diving suits, badass nuclear submarines inexplicably captained by Scotsmen, Kraken...

Actually...

As it turns out, the cables aren't protected at all. And it's not like they're impervious to damage either. The largest of them, hilariously named ""SEA-ME-WE-3"" was severed by a 7.1 magnitude earthquake, and in December of 2008 a boat anchor sliced it and three other cables in half. The disaster cut communications capacity between Europe, the Middle East and India by around 75 percent.

Hundreds of millions of people spent weeks without reliable (or, in some cases, any) Internet access. Because of an anchor.

Though, some skeptics point out that the idea of three separate cables being cut ""accidentally"" by anchors within a few days of each other is a little far-fetched. They've proposed terrorists, Israel, drunken fishermen and the Pentagon as possible alternate causes.

So What Can We Do?

Nothing. Remember the SEA-ME-WE 3 cable we told you about? It's more than twenty-thousand goddamn miles long. Look at this map of all the undersea cables. There's no way you could police all of that, not even with a thousand Krakens AND Bill Murray in a scuba suit.

On the plus side, it's not exactly hard to repair a damaged cable. These things get busted up all the time, which is why the telecoms that own them have repair boats on stand-by. That means everything should be fine unless some bad guys think up a way to really fuck them up.

4 Hordes of Zombie Robots Will Kill Us All
------------------------------------------

You may not have heard of Leo Kuvayev, but you've gotten a shitload of emails from him. He's one of the most influential men in the spam industry. He has headed up several of the world's largest spam networks and is one of the people most responsible for the way spammers operate today. Despite being wanted in several countries, Kuvayev remains free (and fabulously wealthy) to this day. He lives in exile in either Tahiti or Finland.

While breaking Leo's kneecaps with a baseball bat would be both morally justified and incredibly cathartic, you may want to keep your righteous anger in check. It's generally a bad idea to fuck with supervillains. Leo is believed to be the man in charge of the Storm Botnet, a massive network of hijacked drone computers that may number in the tens of millions. If he wanted to, he could turn that vast robot army on you.

But hey, what's the worse a few million zombified computers can do? They might be able to blast you off of the web for a few days, but there's no way a botnet could cause lasting harm to the whole Internet. Right?

Actually...

To give you a sense of scale, Storm is estimated by some to be responsible for a whopping 20 percent of the spam on the Internet. That measures out to billions of messages every single day, including tens of millions of emails laden with viruses that create more bots. Some experts estimate that the botnet is powerful enough to muscle entire goddamn countries off of the Internet.

While Storm is the first botnet to attain this kind of power, it won't be the last. The Storm botnet grew from the Storm Worm, which was spread through a series of spam messages with provocative titles like, ""230 dead as storm batters Europe"" and ""Chinese missile shot down USA aircraft."" People across the world (but mainly in the U.S.) saw what they thought was an important news story in their inbox, opened the email and were immediately infected with the worm.

And just wait until he unleashes Big Worm.

This testical-shrivellingly terrifying video tracks the exponential spread of the botnet. Imagine what someone with grander designs than life as a spam kingpin could do with that sort of power. Entire nations and corporate networks could be brought to their knees, world communication and trade would be disrupted. The Internet as we know it would be rendered almost uninhabitable.

So What Can We Do?

Conventional cyber-warfare tactics are useless against the botnet. As soon as a computer is infected, the worm lobotomizes and re-programs any existing anti-virus software, rendering it harmless. The botnet also has active defenses, and has gone on the offensive and D-DOSed several major anti-spam sites into oblivion. Back in February of 2007, the botnet even attacked the 13 ""root"" servers that make up the backbone of the Internet's infrastructure. Two of them were severely damaged.

Operating at only 10 to 20 percent capacity, the Storm Botnet has national security experts and anti-spam crusaders pissing themselves in terror. The only real defense against a threat like the Storm Botnet is knowledge. All we need is for the entire Internet-using public to become tech-savvy, intelligent and careful about what they click on. Shouldn't be a problem.","The article discusses the fragility of the Internet infrastructure, specifically mentioning 'trans-oceanic cables' and their vulnerability.

On Friday 19 July, 2024, the world woke up to what many have called the worst digital crisis of all time. A botched software update from cybersecurity giant CrowdStrike crashed some 8.5 million computers, smearing Microsoft's dreaded ""blue screen of death"" across the globe. Airlines cancelled over 46,000 flights in a single day. Hospitals called off surgeries. 911 emergency services faced disruptions in the US. Film Forum, an arthouse cinema in New York, switched to cash payments as its credit card system went down. Microsoft and CrowdStrike issued a solution, but the outages continue almost a week later. It's a reminder, frustrated IT experts said, to never push updates out on a Friday.

As our infrastructure becomes ever more tangled with the internet, this won't be the last catastrophic online outage. But CrowdStrike wasn't the first, either. The history of computing is littered with examples of our digital fragility, and crashes of the past offer a glimpse of what it will feel like on the day the internet turns off.

""There's a price to pay for the convenience we enjoy,"" says Ritesh Kotak, a cybersecurity and technology analyst. ""It will happen again, and from a technical standpoint, the fix for CrowdStrike was relatively easy. Next time, we might not be so lucky.""

One of the earliest major outages came in 1997 thanks to a glitch at the company Network Solutions Inc., one of the main registrars that issues domain names for websites. According to the New York Times, a misconfigured database crashed every single website ending in .com or .net. It took down around one million sites, which at that point in history was a huge portion of the web. Some people didn't get their email. An untold number of web searches ended in frustration. Some businesses who couldn't reach clients and customers lost business around the 1997 crash, but overall, the problems were minimal.

Yet with the internet now touching nearly every part of our daily lives, anything close to the Network Solutions outage has far greater consequences. Twenty-one years later, for example, a malware attack on the Alaskan community of Matanuska-Susitna took an array of digital services offline. The internet blackout sent 100,000 people back in time.

""The cyber-attack, God help us, just about stopped everything, you know,"" local Helen Munoz told the BBC in 2019. ""In fact, the borough still hasn't sorted out their computers.""

Employees were locked out of their workstations. Local libraries were ordered to turn off all their devices. In one government office, workers had to switch to typewriters to do their jobs. It was 10 weeks before the majority of the Matanuska-Susitna's systems came back online.

Sometimes the problems start in the physical world. For a while, the entire nation of Armenia's internet connectivity depended on a single fibre-optic cable running through Georgia. If that sounds precarious, you're right. In 2011, a 75-year-old woman took all 2.9 million Armenians offline when she sliced through that cable with a spade near the Georgian village of Ksani. The woman, who was scavenging for copper at the time, was arrested but reportedly let go soon after because of her advanced age. She later told reporters: ""I have no idea what the internet is.""

Forget human error: engineers have to take measures to protect undersea cables from shark attacks. Others felt its absence more keenly. ""You can feel it when you don't have access to the internet. You start going crazy,"" says Vahan Hovsepyan, senior community and public policy advisor at RIPE NCC, the regional internet registry for Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia, who lives in Armenia. ""There's no way to ensure stability when you have a cable that's thousands of kilometres long,"" Hovsepyan says, which highlights the importance of building redundancies into digital infrastructure.

It's proof positive that, on some level, the internet really is just a series of tubes. Pensioners aren't the only threat to those tubes, either. In 2017, all of Zimbabwe lost its internet access for half a day. Local newspapers reported that a tractor had torn through a cable in South Africa.

The fibre-optic cables in our backyards need protection from human beings, but the thousands of kilometres worth of cables draped across the ocean floor face their own dangers. Sharks have a mysterious fondness for biting undersea cables, which has caused outages in the past. There's a long history of teeth marks on these ocean cables, not just from sharks but other fish and barracudas. A tooth can penetrate the insulation and mix sea water to ground the power conductors. It's been causing problems for phone and telegraph cables since at least 1964, according to a report from the United Nations Environment Programme. Today, Google reportedly wraps its underwater cables in a Kevlar-like material, in part to stop sharks and other ocean dwellers from biting through the internet. Videos posted online have captured the web-hating sharks in action.

A quarter of Canada's internet and phone service was knocked out in 2022 because of a failure at Rogers Communications, one of the country's biggest telecom providers. It gave 11 million people a preview of last week's CrowdStrike debacle. Emergency services couldn't accept phone calls, hospitals cancelled appointments and businesses across the country couldn't accept debit card transactions. Canadian R&B star the Weeknd was forced to postpone a concert.

Kotak, who lives in Toronto, says the Rogers outage didn't have a major impact on his life, but others weren't so lucky. ""A friend of mine literally missed the bar exam,"" he says. ""Her whole family were Rogers customers, and she couldn't get the exact address and room number for the test because she only had it written down in her email.""

Legislators can prevent these kinds of problems by mandating safety measures in the technology and telecom industries, Kotak says. But sometimes, governments are responsible for internet shutdowns in the first place.

Disabling the internet is also a go-to method for government censorship, both for authoritarian governments and stable democracies. ""It's a pretty massive problem,"" says Zach Rosson, a data analyst at Access Now, a digital rights advocacy group. ""By our definition, there have been over 1,500 internet shutdowns since 2016"", by governments, militaries and police forces.

In fact, the CrowdStrike disaster shadowed an example that began the same day. For the last week, Bangladesh has faced near total internet blackout after a government shutdown in response to violent clashes between protesting students and police. The online cutoff has been accompanied by a curfew and reporters say the lack of internet access makes accurate information harder to come by. At least 150 people have been killed in the clashes, with some local media putting the figure much higher.

There's a growing push to understand internet access as a human right. ""Think about all the things it gives you access to: employment, healthcare, education, communication, business and just understanding the world around you. We've found that internet shutdowns actually impede humanitarian delivery and prevent the documentation of atrocities,"" Rosson says.

India is probably the world leader in using internet shutdowns to quell unrest, but it's a widespread tactic that's been deployed in at least 83 countries including Iran, Russia, Algeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Cameroon and Venezuela.

In places where the internet connection depends on one fibre-optic cable, it makes for a glaring Achilles heel. After decades of the internet worming its way into every corner of our lives through wires and WiFi connections, you might think there would be more built-in fail-safes to keep the world churning. But largely the opposite is true.","The article discusses undersea cables, including direct mentions and contextual implications of incidents where these cables were cut, such as the case in Armenia and threats from sharks.

**Old laws for new risks at sea: mineral resources, climate change, sea lanes, and cables**

**Abstract**  
Maritime security in a broad sense means more than piracy and terrorism. This paper concentrates on the risk potential of current and future resource-related activities on the seabed. The seabed mining of hard mineral resources—in addition to hydrocarbons—leads to new controversial maritime boundary claims of states in their effort to expand national access rights to raw materials. Outer continental shelf claims in the Arctic Ocean are today's test bench for law of the sea conflicts. Fiber-optic cables running through regional seas, straits, and land bridges may become another risky issue, while the pattern of maritime transport routes is moving from Northern to Southern waters. Under a medium-term perspective, the sea level rise will endanger ports and coasts. Borderlines of maritime zones will move and thus generate more injustice and conflicts among states. The tools to solve borderline conflicts and options for dispute settlement are available in UNCLOS. Some other legal gaps are covered by the 2005 SUA Convention and by bilateral agreements, while resolutions by the UN Security Council begin to broaden rights of intervention and interdiction. The need for new laws remains.  

**Keywords**  
Seabed resources and excessive claims . Natural disasters and climate change . Sea lanes and cables . UNCLOS . SUA Convention 2005 . UN Security Council as a legislator  

**1 Introduction**  
Over the past years, we have witnessed that maritime violence, terrorism, and piracy are continuing to spread while the international legal system of interference rights and counter measures remains full of gaps in addressing these issues. In other words, the inadequacies of the legal system are part of the problem of security at sea.  
...  

**2 Risks over marine mineral resources**  
The world economy, still suffering from the financial crisis, is currently experiencing increasing commodity prices. Industrial associations and governments are monitoring patterns of supply and demand, not only for standard minerals like iron, but also for high-value metals (e.g., nickel, copper, titanium, gold) and rare earth elements (REE) like yttrium, indium, gallium, neodymium, and germanium...  

**2.1 Minerals and the law of the sea**  
Of course, minerals from the seabed cannot replace terrestrial mining. Instead, they can complement the supply and make industry more independent of critical suppliers to the extent that costs and technology allow it to do so. According to many experts, the break-even point is near, while the legal–political conditions are favorable...  

**Conclusion**  
The race has begun for seabed resources, and the implications for maritime law and security are profound. Governments must adapt to these changes to ensure sustainable management of resources and security of communication lines at sea.","The article discusses 'Fiber-optic cables' in the context of maritime security, indicating that they may become a risky issue.

A world without Candy Crush or indeed, even Facebook; a land without the Internet.

The thought may sound like heaven to minimalists, but in recent months, dictators around the world have been all too willing to transform the idea into a hellacious reality, flipping a switch and completely disconnecting whole nations from the Web: Syria. Egypt. Libya. All have been plunged into darkness during periods of civil unrest.

But is there any way the United States could be disconnected from the Internet? Could an act of terror, war, or simple governmental dictatorship snatch away our social feeds and online gaming? Curious, I reached out to several experts to examine all the potential doomsday scenarios.

**Physical attack on the tubes**  
They say the Internet is a series of tubes. One obvious way to disconnect the United States from the rest of the Net would be to cut, blow up, or otherwise destroy those tubes, right?

Not so fast. As it turns out, you’d need to cut a _lot_ of tubes to completely disconnect the U.S. from the Internet. Check out the map below of all the undersea cables that connect the country to the outside world... Disconnecting all of America’s tubes just isn’t going to happen.

“It’s close enough to impossible that in realistic terms, it’s unlikely to the point of irrelevancy,” says Patrick Gilmore, the chief network architect at Akamai... 

**Hack attack on the servers**  
If the tubes are the veins of the Internet, the servers that power the Net are its brains. Could hackers use their botnets and evil geek powers to send America spiraling offline?

“That’s actually much more likely than a physical attack, I think,” says Dorian Kim...  

**The Man holding you down**  
So, widespread tube cutting and hack attacks would not only be incredibly difficult to pull off, but they would also be of questionable effectiveness...

So, rule out the tubes, the hackers, and The Man. What might be the most effective way to wreak havoc on the country’s infrastructure? NTT’s Dorian Kim has an idea...

In a speech to be given today at defence think tank, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), General Sir Nick Carter will warn of the military capabilities of Putin's administration and the threats it poses.

One such danger is towards undersea cables, as discussed by a Policy Exchange report and a previous speech to the RUSI by Air Chief Marshall Sir Stuart Peach. Movements by Russian Navy ""intelligence ships"" have been centred around these important lines of communication, and the cutting of the main comms line in the Crimean peninsula during its annexation of the region shows precedence.

The speech will also discuss the Russians' long-range strike capabilities and other areas where Carter feels the UK is lagging behind.

This comes after calls from MPs to increase defence spending, as well as reports of plans to cut down and consolidate the Armed Forces to save £20bn despite opposition from defence minister Gavin Williamson, who has reportedly given his approval to Carter's lecture.

""The threats we face are not thousands of miles away but are now on Europe's doorstep – we have seen how cyber warfare can be both waged on the battlefield and to disrupt normal people's lives – we in the UK are not immune from that,"" an excerpt from Carter's upcoming speech reads.

""We must take notice of what is going on around us or our ability to take action will be massively constrained. Speed of decision making, speed of deployment and modern capability are essential if we wish to provide realistic deterrence.

""The time to address these threats is now – we cannot afford to sit back.""

Concerns around the Russian cybersecurity threat have been growing in recent months, leading to a government ban on the use of Russian-made antivirus software on its own computers; while Ciaran Martin, chief exec of the National Cyber Security Centre, revealed that hackers acting on behalf of Russia had targeted the UK's telecommunications, media and energy sectors.

Maybe your spreadsheet won’t load. Or Netflix gets laggy and your Wi-Fi connection stalls out. And the thought occurs, ‘What if the whole internet crashed?’  
And once you wonder it, the thought won’t go away. What is the internet anyway? A bunch of interconnected computers. Couldn’t they crash, all at once? What would it take? For those of us who deal with technology for a living, the question bears consideration.  
Think laterally for a minute and the spooky questions pile up: What would it do to the markets, the military, the hospitals? How would we access those back episodes of Arrested Development?  
Follow along as we take a brief and speculative pass at this complex issue and attempt to answer this doomsday inquiry: Could the internet crash? Conventional wisdom tells us no: As a planetary network of computers and machines, the internet is too big, too decentralized, and too redundant to fail all at once. And yet doomsday scenarios have been proposed, and not just by the tinfoil-hat crowd.  
**A network of networks**  
Let’s start with that conventional wisdom: It’s generally accepted that the internet, as a network, cannot crash because it’s not a single network at all. It is a massive, interconnected network of networks. It is the most powerful and intricate communication matrix ever assembled by humankind. The internet changes from minute to minute – second to second, even – as different computers and other machines log in and drop out.  
Paul Levinson, author and professor of communication and media studies at Fordham University, has spent much of his career analyzing the internet through the lens of systems theory. He says the very nature of the internet, as a radically decentralized tangle of individual networks, largely protects it from crashing.  
“It would be very, very hard for the entire internet to crash based on an important systems theory principle called redundancy,” Levinson says. “There are so many backup systems, so many workarounds, so many different ways to get from point A to point B. All these come online instantly and automatically if the system fails.”  
But this is only slide 2, so clearly the story doesn’t end here.  
**Nodes and wires**  
For the internet to experience a total global collapse – or even a regional collapse based in, say, North America – some kind of agency or event would have to simultaneously disable all the network service providers (NSPs) that were online at that time. NSPs link commercial ISPs to the internet backbone and they’re scattered all over the globe, each with multiple facilities distributed across the geographical area that the service covers.  
These NSPs provide the very infrastructure of the internet. If one fails, internet traffic is simply routed around that problem by way of the thousands of other available paths. In terms of its physical components, each of these paths is made up of various hardware elements: The actual servers, cables and equipment. But there is no way to crash the internet by disabling one piece of hardware – or even one thousand pieces. There’s no central cord to cut, no main plug to pull. To stop or even significantly slow the internet across any sizable geographic area, you’d have to do a lot of damage in a lot of different places.  
“It would require a catastrophe,” Levinson says. “An event or series of events of such massive physical destruction that large portions of the internet’s underlying hardware – the cables, the servers, the facilities – were severely damaged.”  
**Catastrophe!**  
The good news, if that’s the right term, is that any global catastrophe big enough to take out all the world’s NSPs would likely kill all life on the planet as well. These would be extinction-level events like an asteroid impact or global thermonuclear war, Levinson says. If we do face such an eventuality, internet access will be low on our list of immediate concerns.  
However, smaller disasters could certainly knock out portions of the internet temporarily. In fact, they already have. The most vulnerable component of the internet backbone is the network of undersea fiber optic cables that connect the continents. These cables – more than 400 worldwide at last count – are regularly cut and ruptured by rock slides, undersea earthquakes, and other natural phenomena.  
The clear majority of these cables are unarmored, unguarded, small and relatively delicate – about the size of a garden hose. Isolated faults caused by natural phenomena, or even the occasional errant anchor, are usually not a problem because traffic is instantly rerouted to other cables. Still, accidents do happen. In 2011, a 75-year-old woman shoveling for shoreline copper severed a cable and took down internet access in Armenia for five hours.  
**Sabotage!**  
This brings us to the first of our internet crash scenarios – the deliberate sabotage of undersea cables, either by terrorists or (more likely) military forces. In early 2017, NATO officials publicly disclosed that Russian submarines had dramatically increased activity around undersea data cables connecting Europe and North America.  
“We are now seeing Russian underwater activity in the vicinity of undersea cables that I don’t believe we have ever seen,” U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Andrew Lennon, commander of NATO’s submarine forces, told the Washington Post. “Russia is clearly taking an interest in NATO and NATO nations’ undersea infrastructure.”  
If Russia were to sever all or most of the cables in the Pacific and Atlantic in a coordinated strike, the move wouldn’t quite crash the internet. But it would essentially isolate America and, more to the point, disrupt communications between the U.S. and European NATO allies.  
Nefarious human activities aren’t the only potential risk to the internet. (Although they are the scariest, more on that in a bit.) In 2015, a committee within the nonprofit organization ICANN issued a rather alarming report concerning a potential weakness buried deep in the internet’s underlying structure.  
According to the committee report, a vulnerability in the internet’s address book system could potentially magnify the effect of any physical disruption to root servers or undersea cables. Ironically, the dilemma is keyed to the central strength of the internet – redundancy. If a significant portion of the internet were to go down for several days, the “backup system” of redundant paths could get terminally confused, mixing up new data with out-of-date information. The details get pretty complex. If you speak high-end engineering, you can read the original report.  
And if these root servers were to be deliberately disabled, well – then things get very grim.  
“The most interesting way to crash the internet is to focus on the 13 top-level root servers that ultimately help us find computers by name on the internet,” says Dr. Patrick Juola, computer science professor at Duquesne University and author of Principles of Computer Organization and Assembly Language. “If those computers could be disabled – whether by a power outage, a virus, or physical damage – most computers would not be able to find each other to send messages. In practical terms, the internet would simply stop working.”  
Surely the most dramatic of all the potential internet doomsday scenarios, the possibility of a massive solar flare has kept experts up nights for several decades. Solar flare concerns predate the internet, actually. Science has long known that a major solar flare could produce an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) that could, theoretically, fry all electronics on the planet.  
“A sufficiently powerful solar flare could produce an electromagnetic pulse that would shut down most of the computers in the world,” Juola says. “While some systems are protected against EMPs, any human-built protection is only so strong, and the sun can be a lot more powerful.”  
Levinson concurs, and adds that other threats might descend from the heavenly firmament as well. “With all of our technological prowess, we still have not in any way mastered or even uncovered all the forces at work in the universe,” he says. “We don’t know all the things that can go wrong.”  
Even if we set aside natural disasters, cosmic blasts and coding glitches, we still have at least one other major threat to worry about. This is the scenario that is most popular in sci-fi films, high-tech thrillers, and pop culture in general. What if a hacker or group of hackers – state-sponsored or otherwise – actually figured out a way to disable the entire internet? What if someone develops a brand-new kind of virus, a chunk of mutant code that we can’t even imagine at this point? Levinson calls it the Evil Genius problem.  
“Now this is highly unlikely, but it’s not impossible,” Levinson says. “But there is always a chance that some devious hacking group figures out a way to bring down the internet and all the backup systems that provide redundancy.”  
Once again, conventional wisdom tells us that there is simply no way this could happen; that the very architecture of the internet would prevent such a viral doomsday event. But a bedrock principle of computer security, Levinson says, is that you never say never. And you always prepare for the worst.  
“Look, my best guess is that, at this point, no one knows how to bring down the whole internet, or even any significant part of it,” he says. “But it’s foolhardy not to speculate about what might happen.”","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, highlighting their vulnerability to natural and deliberate disruptions.

So many facets of human life are nowadays facilitated by a giant machine called “the internet,” which networks the world to unlock all kinds technological convenience. By instantaneously moving information from one place to another, the internet touches everything we depend on in 2016 — our transportation systems, our mortgage payments, and our Amazon purchases alike. To say goodbye to it permanently wouldn’t be like losing a limb; it would require a whole new worldview.

Malicious actors have previously made parts of the internet disappear for some people. It happened as recently as October, when a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against a company called Dyn temporarily made A-list services like Reddit, Twitter, and Spotify evaporate. Acting as a type of phone book for the internet, Dyn provides domain name system services to these and many more sites, so when you type, say, “www.facebook.com” into your browser, Dyn translates this into the numerical IP address of the server you want to access.

Dyn, an internet service company, is based in the old mill section of Manchester, New Hampshire.

Domain name system service providers are what make the internet usable for humans. When hackers successfully overwhelmed Dyn’s servers with bogus requests for information, the system could no longer handle legitimate traffic. A fundamental infrastructure that makes part of the internet work had been turned off, and with Twitter down, no one could tweet their complaints about it.

But what would it take to multiply this effort such that the entire internet was permanently taken down? How many people would it take to pull it off?

Though many computers were involved in the attack against Dyn, it theoretically would have taken only one person to steer the ship. The weapon of choice for these situations is a “botnet,” or a collection of private computers infected by the same malware, granting a third party some control over these machines. A botnet of a few thousand infected computers could be used for everything from sending spam email messages to manipulating online polls. A botnet owner with a few hundred thousand internet-connected computers at his or her disposal could cause much higher-profile problems, like making Facebook disappear for the internet-using public.

But can one person take down the entire internet? “The answer is no,” says Gleb Budman, CEO of BackBlaze, a backup company and cloud storage provider. “Even the large-scale attack against Dyn still only knocked out certain sites down for certain people for certain amounts of time. That myth is busted.” And as a botnet relies on the internet to work, it can’t destroy the system that enables it.

It’s difficult to cripple the web because it’s extremely robust. In his book _Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet_, author Andrew Blum calls it a “network of networks” — it has no single off switch, but is instead a collection of layered systems that interact with each other to keep us online and connected at all costs. This means botnet-enabled denial of service attacks have more in common with vandalism and short-lived inconvenience than they do with actual lasting damage. But this hasn’t stopped people from seeking to do more genuine harm to the internet.

In the age of wi-fi, it’s easy to forget that most of the internet is still physical. Our communication with distant parts of the world is made possible only because an immense system of communication cables sits on the ocean floor, connecting continent to continent. You can browse a map of these cables here. Large countries are connected at a number of points, meaning their web traffic is easily rerouted around digital roadblocks; a host of detours are available when a country needs them.

But consider a smaller nation like New Zealand, connected to the rest of the world by just two cables. With a couple serious snips in the right place, an entire country gets knocked offline (divers in Egypt were caught doing exactly this in 2013). If this seems like a like an obvious problem deserving a resilient solution, you’re right: The consensus is that these essential cables are “surprisingly vulnerable.” Earthquakes, deep sea divers, large anchors, and even sharks have taken areas of the globe offline for a few days to a few months.

In 2015, someone carried out a mysterious series of attacks on the West Coast’s fiber optic cable system. Again, the method was low-tech but effective: By climbing down manholes and cutting cables, the actor was able to slow California’s internet speeds and even interrupt Microsoft’s enterprise service, Azure. If that effort were carried out at a larger scale, or deep in a remote part of the ocean, it would wreak a lasting havoc difficult to recover from.

And since it’s common today for those in the developing world to manage their entire relationship with the internet through an iOS- or Android-powered mobile phone, “if something happened to shut off the internet in these systems, half the world loses its connectivity,” says Budman.

This consolidation of resources hasn’t really been seen before in the history of the internet, which was born as random, varied servers popped up all over the place. But we are accessing the internet in an increasingly homogenous way; a hack or flaw in these dominant systems — or a questionable decision by Google and Apple — could make the internet disappear for more than a third of the 3.2 billion people who access it each year.

There is simultaneously relief and caution here. No one person could permanently dismantle the internet, but if a savvy-enough group of people acted together to jam networks and attack physical infrastructure, then we’d all have to start reading books again.","The article discusses the vulnerability of undersea cables and provides specific examples of incidents where cables were cut, such as the 2013 incident in Egypt.

When cable cuts occur, whether submarine or terrestrial, they often result in observable disruptions to Internet connectivity, knocking a network, city, or country offline. This is especially true when there is insufficient resilience or alternative paths — that is, when a cable is effectively a single point of failure. Associated observations of traffic loss resulting from these disruptions are frequently covered by Cloudflare Radar in social media and blog posts. However, two recent cable cuts that occurred in the Baltic Sea resulted in little-to-no observable impact to the affected countries, as we discuss below, in large part because of the significant redundancy and resilience of Internet infrastructure in Europe.

### BCS East-West Interlink

On Sunday, November 17 2024, the BCS East-West Interlink submarine cable connecting Sventoji, Lithuania and Katthammarsvik, Sweden was reportedly damaged around 10:00 local (Lithuania) time (08:00 UTC). A Data Center Dynamics article about the cable cut quotes the CTO of Telia Lietuva, the telecommunications provider that operates the cable, and notes “The Lithuanian cable carried about a third of the nation's Internet capacity, but capacity was carried via other routes.”

As the Cloudflare Radar graphs below show, there was no apparent impact to traffic volumes in either country at the time that the cables were damaged.

### Internet quality

Internet quality metrics for both countries show changes in measured bandwidth and latency throughout the day on Sunday, but with no sudden anomalous shifts visible around the time of the cable cut. The latency graph for Sweden does show an increase in latency, but it began before the cable cut occurred.

### Visibility in BGP events, announced IP address space unaffected

BGP announcements are a way for network providers to communicate routing information to other networks, and announcement activity observed on Telia Lietuva’s autonomous systems around the time of the cable cut may be related to the re-routing referenced in the article. No change in announced IP address space was visible for any of these autonomous systems, suggesting no loss of connectivity as the capacity was re-routed.

Telegeography’s submarinecablemap.com illustrates, at least in part, the resilience in connectivity enjoyed by these two countries. In addition to the damaged cable, it shows that Lithuania is connected to neighboring Latvia as well as to the Swedish mainland. Over 20 submarine cables land in Sweden, connecting it to multiple countries across Europe.

### C-Lion1

Less than a day later, the C-Lion1 submarine cable, which connects Helsinki, Finland and Rostock Germany was reportedly damaged during the early morning hours of Monday, November 18. Cinia, the telecommunications company that owns the cable, said that the cable stopped working at about 02:00 UTC.

In this situation as well, as the Cloudflare Radar graphs below show, there was no apparent impact to traffic volumes in either country at the time that the cables were damaged.

### Internet quality

By looking at volume-related metrics, alone, Internet connectivity would appear to be unaffected by the cable cut.

### BGP business as usual

From a routing perspective, there was no notable BGP announcement activity observed for top autonomous systems in either Finland or Germany around 02:00 on November 18, and total announced IP address space aggregated at a country level also demonstrated no change.

### Conclusion

As we have discussed in multiple prior blog posts, cable cuts often cause significant disruptions to Internet connectivity. These disruptions are often quite lengthy as well, due to the time needed to marshal repair resources, identify the location of the damage, etc. Although it is not always feasible due to financial or geographic constraints, building redundant and resilient network architecture, at multiple levels, is a best practice. This includes the sending traffic over multiple physical cables (both submarine and terrestrial), connecting to multiple peer and upstream network providers, and even avoiding single points of failure in core Internet resources like DNS servers.

The Cloudflare Radar team continually monitors the status of Internet connectivity in countries/regions around the world, and we share our observations on the Cloudflare Radar Outage Center, via social media, and in posts on blog.cloudflare.com.","The article discusses the topic of cut sea cables in detail, including specific incidents involving submarine cables in the Baltic Sea and their impact on internet connectivity.

We’ve all seen some of the latest apocalyptic movies with some pretty epic reasons for losing Internet, electricity and other modern technologies. What’s interesting is that a lot of these reasons are far-fetched and aren’t always entirely realistic.

So here is where you pose a really challenging question: How, in today’s world, can the Internet completely go down?

Before we get into “how” – we have to understand “what” the Internet really is. At a very high-level, the Internet is a vast interconnected network of data centers spanning the globe. These data centers have exchange points, protocols and routes that they have to follow. With every year that passes, the Internet becomes more and more resilient. Why? Because at this point, Internet communication is absolutely critical to the survival of our current society.

To really understand just how complex the Internet will be, here is the entire Internet network, in all of its glory.

**Cutting the wires**  
Bringing down a couple - or even all - of the satellites will actually do little to cut Internet traffic. Yes, it will cause an amazing amount of issues, but the Internet will most likely live on. At this point, roughly 99 percent of global Web traffic is dependent on deep-sea networks of fiber-optic cables that blanket the ocean floor like a nervous system. These are major tangible targets – creating very real choke points in the system.

Consider this: As much as three-fourths of the international communications between the Middle East and Europe have been carried by two undersea cables, FLAG Telecom's FLAG Europe-Asia cable. To make things movie-worthy, you can’t just cut the wires. Why? Because they’re designed to be fixed. However, a strategic strike that will take out the fiber optic cables or damage the entire wire will do the trick. If this is done at choke points you can disable or almost completely halt global Internet traffic.

**Destroy root servers**  
It’s much easier to go to Google.com than to type in 74.125.225.131. That’s what root servers do – they are responsible for decoding .com, .net, .org. names before aligning them with the correct IP address. If you take out these servers, the Internet will no longer recognize the alphabet when you type in an address.

Here’s the interesting part: there are ""only"" 13 servers that do this. Effectively, if you take these servers down, the only way to “browse” the Internet will be with a physical piece of paper, a pen and a really good memory around numbers.

**Cyber warfare/political**  
China, Iran, North Korea, Syria and a few other folks already have an “Internet Kill Switch.” We’ve seen an entire country go dark. When Syrian and Egyptian rebels were posting pictures of the conflict, the government simply flipped a “switch.""

What if the U.S. had this switch? What about the EU? What if there were secret programs (NSA-style) that had complete control of the Internet from a kill-switch perspective? Here’s the interesting part – what if it broke? A country or governing body can take down the Internet; but what if they can’t bring it back up? 

**Take out the data centers**  
This is a possibility. The modern data center does indeed house all of the major components around the Internet. So, why not cut the wires AND take down the data centers? At this point, you’ve cut the wires, and for your final act – you take down some of the major data centers and their exchange points. 

**Massive solar event**  
From a catastrophe perspective, this is a bit cliché but it is possible. If there is a major solar flare - or a large solar storm – communications can be affected. Still, the enormity of this storm would probably cause issues outside of just the Internet going down. 

**Remove key people**  
By far the MOST resilient part of the Internet is the people that support it. When in absolute dire emergencies, people have been known to do amazing things to fix and resolve issues.

Ultimately, there will be other people that can help rebuild what needs to be put in place for the Internet to work. The question becomes the goal of the outage or the attack. If the attack is well thought out and executed, the outage can last many months. Taking down the Internet even for 6 months will pretty much place all of us back into the stone age when it comes to communications. 

We have already seen brief outages, latency or other issues cause mini-panics across affected regions. A global meltdown of Internet services would be pretty catastrophic. Fortunately for all of us, at the core, the Internet really does have a massive amount of redundancy and resiliency built in. 

Even still, the future will see many more people join the cloud and the Internet. Global communications will continue to expand and become critical components of our society. In all of our development, it’s very important that we never lose sight of creating recovery points, resilient environments, and a platform capable of supporting both our current and future needs.","The article discusses the implications of cutting undersea cables, stating that 'roughly 99 percent of global Web traffic is dependent on deep-sea networks of fiber-optic cables.' It details how strategic strikes on these cables can disrupt global internet traffic and emphasizes their critical role in international communications.

"Offshore Wind Transmission Cable Issues","Examines transmission cable problems affecting offshore wind farms, including Block Island and Ørsted, with implications for renewable energy reliability.","https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/renewable/wind/offshore-wind-experiences-problems-with-transmission-cables","2021-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","IER",Yes,"IER","Washington, D.C.",-,"2021-05-18","English","IER","**Offshore Wind Experiences Problems with Transmission Cables**

First Block Island, offshore Rhode Island, and now wind farms offshore Europe are experiencing problems with transmission cables requiring millions of dollars of investments. The Block Island offshore wind farm, a 30-megawatt facility off the coast of Rhode Island, found that its high voltage cables that carry electricity to land were not buried deep enough and were being exposed as the seabed was being worn away by tides and storms, making the exposed cables dangerous to swimmers. National Grid and Ørsted, the current owner, are replacing the cable to a greater depth, which state regulators had originally wanted, but were over-ruled by a state board supportive of the project. National Grid, which owns the cable that connects the island to the mainland, will charge customers of the Narragansett Electric Company to fix its portion of the problem. National Grid’s reconstruction cost is expected to be $30 million and it will be recovered through an undetermined surcharge on ratepayers’ bills. Ørsted’s cost, which cannot be passed on, is unknown. This is a costly undertaking.

Ørsted, a Danish Company that is the world’s largest developer of offshore wind projects, also found that some of its transmission cables connecting wind farms to European towns have been damaged by scraping against rocks that had been placed on the seabed to prevent erosion. The cost to fix the problems will be as much as 3 billion Danish kroner ($489 million). The company identified 10 projects in the U.K. and Europe that used the same design and that may need to be repaired. Some projects can be fixed by putting more rocks on top of the cables to make them stay in place. In other cases, the cables will have to be repaired or replaced, which is where the major cost is. Laying cables on top of rocks was the industry standard at the time these wind farms were built several years ago, but is no longer used by offshore wind developers. Ørsted may not be the only company facing these problems in Europe as other offshore wind farms may have similar issues with their cable layout.

**Ørsted and National Grid’s Cable Fix for Block Island Wind Farm**

Offshore wind farms involve a network of turbines with cables that connect to shore and into the power grid. The reconstruction project requires replacing approximately 520 meters of National Grid’s sea2shore submarine cable that carries electricity between Block Island and mainland Rhode Island, and approximately 945 meters of Ørsted’s subsea cable that carries electricity from the wind farm to Block Island. The original cables were installed in the spring/summer of 2016.

Ørsted and National Grid determined the best approach to maintain the required burial depths of the two transmission cables is to reinstall these limited segments with new sections adjacent to where the existing cables are now situated. The cable landings will be constructed using a horizontal directional drill and a conduit will be installed for the new length of onshore cable. The horizontal directional drill will bury the cables at a depth of between eight to 15 meters below the seafloor, compared with the current 1.2 to 1.8 meters.

The new cables will be spliced onto the existing cable that connects the Island, the wind project, and the mainland. The existing portions of the exposed cables are scheduled to be removed at the end of construction.

Block Island and Rhode Island will continue to receive electricity from the wind farm during the reconstruction, except for a brief outage when the new cable will be spliced with the existing cable. During the outage, Block Island Power Company will provide the needed electrical power to the Island using its on-island diesel generation. The anticipated project completion date is before the end of May 2021.

**Biden’s Offshore Wind Plan**

President Biden’s plan to reach net zero carbon dioxide emissions in the generating sector includes the installation of some 30,000 megawatts of new offshore wind capacity by 2030, the equivalent of 1,000 Block Island projects. Building 30,000 megawatts of capacity will require “massive industrialization” of the oceans, anchoring thousands of offshore platforms along the coasts that could pose significant threats to navigation, marine mammals and fisheries. It is important to note that “capacity” is not “output” with intermittent renewable sources and that large offshore wind projects are expected to average a 51 percent “capacity factor” by 2022. Therefore, just over 15,000 megawatts of actual available power can be obtained from the 30,000 megawatts Biden has proposed.

Offshore wind is far more expensive than other generating technologies, including coal, natural gas, nuclear power and onshore renewable energy, according to the Energy Information Administration. In 2026, the agency estimates that producing one megawatt-hour of electricity from offshore wind will cost about $121–almost double the cost of generating that same amount of energy with an advanced nuclear reactor ($69), more than three times the projected cost of producing it with natural gas ($37), and even more than coal ($73). Large increases in electricity prices will be particularly harmful to low- and middle-income consumers and particularly painful in New York and New England, where consumers already pay some of America’s highest electricity prices.

And, as Block Island and European offshore wind projects indicate, costly repairs may be needed as well after the wind farms are built.

**Conclusion**

The first-hand experience with the Block Island wind project is indicative of the future pitfalls that the U.S. offshore wind industry can expect as it continues toward replacing existing traditional generating technologies with offshore wind to meet Biden’s quotas. Offshore wind is expensive and should not be pushed onto Americans as a major way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions when other energy forms are available that are less expensive.","The article discusses transmission cables related to offshore wind projects, focusing on problems experienced by the Block Island wind farm and Ørsted's projects in Europe.

While it does not use the exact terms 'cut sea cables' or 'submarine cables', it addresses issues of cable damage and the implications of such problems, which align with the broader topic of undersea cables.

Remember when [Anonymous threatened to destroy the entire internet](http://pastebin.com/NKbnh8q8)? We laughed, and ultimately their words were just hacker hubris. But it got us thinking—_could_ someone actually destroy the Internet?  
  
We did some digging, and guess what: With enough effort, the entire thing can be shattered. Physically. Completely. Here's how to kill the net.  
  
_Before we destroy mankind's greatest, vastest machine, let's get something polite out of the way: don't. Destroying the Internet's core infrastructure would constitute the greatest act of global terrorism in history and/or a declaration of war against every sovereign nation in existence—to say nothing of the danger it would put both you and others in. This is a thought exercise._  
  
So put on your thought exercise caps and come with us on a journey across the world. Let's figure out how this could possibly be done. Let's figure out exactly what it would take, what cords to rip—because the _Internet under attack_ is an oft-invoked idea. What would true defeat really mean? What would the web's downfall even look like? Where would it happen?  
  
The first step on this trip is mental. We need to begin by no longer treating the Internet like a ghost. It's made of more metal, plastic, and fiber than you can fathom—and it's spread across the whole world, a monster machine that hugs the entire globe. So we hunted down the web's physical foundation, across land and sea, to pinpoint exactly what you'd need to take out. Hypothetically.  
  
Cut the Cables  
Forget wireless. The Internet exists because of hundreds of thousands of miles of thick, old fashioned cables. Hundreds upon hundreds of undersea, intercontinental cable lines, cross-crossing around the world, are what put your tweets onto a monitor in Pakistan. Kill the connections, and the networks can't speak across oceans. The Internet is instantly fractured.  
  
Here is every single internet cable in the world.  
  
The cables, as with anything underwater, come straight out of the water, often just lying atop a beach like this one. They're sometimes disguised or partially buried. But sometimes they're just lying out on the sand like an abandoned boogie board.  
  
We asked the burly crew at Best Made, crafter of damn-fine axes, what they'd recommend for cutting through the Internet's backbone, and how much elbow grease it'd take.  
  
Although the exact location of many of the cables and their onshore landing stations are kept a secret by private corporate owners, many aren't—in fact, they're found on popular beaches and bustling towns.  
  
The other most crippling attacks would be executed as follows, using the list of towns and beaches above:  
> Singapore  
> Egypt (both on the Med and Red Sea)  
> SW United Kingdom  
> Tokyo  
> Hong Kong  
> South Florida  
> Marseilles  
> Sicily  
> Mumbai  
> Chennai  
  
Ruin the Root Servers  
""Google.com"" is a crutch. Typing in a domain name actually translates an obscure numerical identifier, the IP address: 74.125.228.37. And there's no way you're going to remember 74.125.228.37, along with tens of other such numbers for every site you visit each day.  
  
There are 13 servers, labeled only by a single letter, backed up hundreds of times over, that are responsible for decoding .com (and .net, and .org, etc) before serving up the corresponding IP address. Knock these machines offline, and the alphabet isn't part of the internet anymore; if you want to navigate what's left of the web, you better have a pad and pencil, or an extremely good memory.  
  
So how would one find and destroy these servers? Like the cables that feed them, the servers are also an open secret. In order for them to be any use at all, they have to be absolutely transparent.","The article discusses the destruction of undersea cables as a central theme, detailing how cutting these cables would lead to significant disruptions in Internet connectivity.

The coming threats to the global Internet could take many forms.  

The raging battle over SOPA and PIPA, the proposed anti-piracy laws, is looking more and more likely to end in favor of Internet freedom — but it won't be the last battle of its kind. Although, ethereal as it is, the Internet seems destined to survive in some form or another, experts warn that there are many threats to its status quo existence, and there is much about it that could be ruined or lost.  

**Physical destruction**  
A vast behemoth that can route around outages and self-heal, the Internet has grown physically invulnerable to destruction by bombs, fires or natural disasters — within countries, at least. It's ""very richly interconnected,"" said David Clark, a computer scientist at MIT who was a leader in the development of the Internet during the 1970s. ""You would have to work real hard to find a small number of places where you could seriously disrupt connectivity."" On 9/11, for example, the destruction of the major switching center in south Manhattan disrupted service locally. But service was restored about 15 minutes later when the center ""healed"" as the built-in protocols routed users and information around the outage.  

However, while it's essentially impossible to cripple connectivity internally in a country, Clark said it is conceivable that one country could block another's access to its share of the Internet cloud; this could be done by severing the actual cables that carry Internet data between the two countries. Thousands of miles of undersea fiber-optic cables that convey data from continent to continent rise out of the ocean in only a few dozen locations, branching out from those hubs to connect to millions of computers. But if someone were to blow up one of these hubs — the station in Miami, for example, which handles some 90 percent of the Internet traffic between North America and Latin America — the Internet connection between the two would be severely hampered until the infrastructure was repaired.  

Such a move would be ""an act of cyberwar,"" Clark told Life's Little Mysteries.  

**Content cache**  
Even an extreme disruption of international connectivity would not seriously threaten the survival of Web content itself. A ""hard"" copy of most data is stored in nonvolatile memory, which sticks around with or without power, and whether you have Internet access to it or not. Furthermore, according to William Lehr, an MIT economist who studies the economics and regulatory policy of the Internet-infrastructure industries, the corporate data centers that harbor Web content — everything from your emails to this article — have sophisticated ways to back up and diversely store the data, including simply storing copies in multiple locations.  

Google even stores cached copies of all Wikipedia pages; these were accessible on Jan. 18 when Wikipedia took its own versions of the pages offline in protest of SOPA and PIPA.  

This diversified storage plan keeps the content itself safe, but it also offers some protection against loss of access to any one copy of the data in the event of a cyberwar. For example, if power were cut to a server, you may be unable to reach a website on its home server, but you may find a cached version of the content stored on another, accessible server. Or, ""If you wanted data that was not available from a server in country X, you may be able to get substantively the same data from a server in country Y,"" Lehr said.  

**Internet arms race**  
The redundancy of so much online content and of connectivity routes makes the Internet resilient to physical attacks, but a much more serious threat to its status quo existence is government regulation or censorship. In the early days of Egypt's Arab Spring uprising, the government of Hosni Mubarak attempted to shut down the country's Internet in order to cripple protesters' ability to organize; it did this by ordering the state-controlled Internet Service Provider (ISP), which grants Internet access to customers, to cut service.  

""ISPs have direct control of the Internet, so what happens in any country depends on the control that the state has over those ISPs,"" Clark said at the time. ""Some countries regulate the ISPs much more heavily. China has in the past 'turned off' the Internet in various regions.""  

However, in Egypt last year, many protesters found ways to bootstrap connectivity and bypass the shut-off, such as by using smartphones to communicate with the global Internet over cellular networks and tapping into private companies' Intranet connections. ""A lot of the connectivity to protesters was provided by workers who made access available to their business networks,"" Lehr said.  

If, in future, the U.S. government sought to shut down or limit Internet access, similar workarounds would crop up, and they would grow more sophisticated as the regulatory methods became more extreme — a ""weapons race,"" Lehr called it. ""The tools for fighting the war are mostly defensive (fire walls, shutting down interconnects, monitoring, locking up folks who have violated 'laws') but also can be offensive (viruses to attack hostile websites/destroy content, locking folks up preemptively, etc.).""  

Governments could also simply tax Internet access, or providers could jack up the prices, in such a way as to price it out of reach of most people.  

Lehr added that, while no single government could destroy the Internet everywhere, it could certainly cripple it sufficiently to render its use unattractive for people within its country of governance.  

**In the balance**  
Bad regulation, be it in any particular country or on the international scale, could severely hamper the Internet's value and its ability to grow, Lehr said. While some version of the Internet is likely to exist as long as humanity does, what might be lost or greatly diminished is ""the openness of the Internet.""  

This openness is useful both economically and socially, but it is also a source of problems, Lehr noted; it lends itself to endless security and privacy attacks, junk mail, viruses, malware and so on. He believes new security models must be developed to protect privacy and security while still allowing the Internet to function.  

""Whether we can effectively strike that balance is a difficult challenge and work in progress.""

Our data is moving into the cloud. While in the past we stored data on the computers on our desks, now we increasingly give control of our data to far-away professionals and give up our hard drives for storage online in the “cloud.” A PEW report in 2008 found that sixty-nine percent of Americans had either stored files online or used a web-based software application at least once. Now over one exabyte, or over one billion gigabytes, of data is stored among the many cloud services like Gmail and Dropbox. Amazon’s S3 cloud storage service, which provides the cloud storage space for companies like Dropbox, stores 762 billion objects. That is enough for 108 objects per person on earth. In 2013, the cloud market is predicted to grow by 18.5 percent. By 2016, it is estimated that users will store more than one third of their digital content in the cloud. It is not just individuals accessing their documents via Dropbox that make up this migration to the cloud. Companies looking to save on expensive hardware and the salaries of the IT professionals required to maintain that expensive hardware are also looking toward the cloud for their own data storage. Because individuals and businesses increasingly rely on the cloud to perform basic functions, reliable access to that cloud is not merely important – it is critical. The concerns about cloud storage are thus two-fold: the security of the data itself and the security of our access to that data. This article focuses on the latter concern. Specifically, this article focuses on the security of one critical component of the global Internet infrastructure that we use to access the cloud: undersea cables. These cables once carried only transatlantic telegraph messages. Now they carry any kind of communication – telephone calls, emails, bank account transfers – across the globe. Accessing files from the cloud is just one of the many ways we rely on this infrastructure. As cloud storage grows and multinational companies begin to rely on these cables to access their files, the potential economic impact of a breach of these cables becomes catastrophic. This article argues that the growth in cloud storage has raised the stakes when it comes to undersea cable security by making our ability to access our day-to-day files dependent on them. Furthermore, it is unclear who, if anyone, would be responsible for the economic loss associated with a loss of access to those files. Part II of this article explores the idea of cloud storage and how access to information in the cloud has become a global issue that relies on undersea cables. It examines the structural flaws in undersea cable security and the inability of the current legal system to compensate victims for the loss of access to data in the event of a breach of undersea cable security. Part III explores and critiques various solutions to ensure that access to data in the cloud remains safe from undersea cable breaches and that any economic loss due to cable breaches can be compensated. This article then advocates in Part IV for a solution that includes a shift of liability to cloud storage providers and increased redundancy requirements.","The article discusses the critical role of undersea cables in global internet infrastructure and how their security is vital for accessing cloud storage.

Among other issues with offshore wind farms, one of the biggest problems to affect the industry are issues with subsea cables. Failures and issues during installation and maintenance of subsea cables have cost companies millions of dollars and have caused many delays in this new and quickly rising industry.

While much information on cable issues is closely guarded, there have been some high profile cases as well as some studies done regarding damage to offshore wind farms. One of these studies, conducted by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), partially delves into issues specific to subsea cables. Failure statistics have shown that third party mechanical damage to cables is three to five times more likely that the risk of internal cable failures. A few examples of third-party subsea cable damage include:

* **Jackup “Jacked Up” On a Cable:** One issue is the risk of Jackups “Jacking Up” on a cable. A Jackup is a floating barge fitted with long support legs that can be raised or lowered to service oil and gas platforms or wind turbines. According to the study by the BSEE, there have been issues with cables getting caught in the jackup and being damaged in the equipment.
* **Anchors Damage To Cable:** Another common issue is damage from third party anchors. Often times, anchors of laying vessels will tangle with the cable being laid and cause damage to the cable.
* **Cable Kinked:** Perhaps one of the most common issues with subsea cables is their tendency to kink or bend. It is very easy to get a kink into the line when preparing to install cables and unkinking is a major exercise requiring special skills.

In addition to these issues, other common problems to cable installation can include: damage to cable during installation, weather or soil-related damage, cable or joint failure, or sediment movement that can lead to cable exposure.

Subsea cables are complicated pieces of equipment and need to be handled with care and should only be used with only the best cable hardware to promote longevity and fortification.

Britain risks being vulnerable to enemy action, including cyber attacks, unless adequate resources are urgently devoted to the nation’s defence, the head of the British Army will warn today in a keynote speech.

Pointing to conventional threats, General Sir Nick Carter will stress that Vladimir Putin’s Russia has built an aggressive military force which this “country would struggle to match”. He will describe how the Kremlin has been ready to use its advanced capabilities in conflicts in Syria and Ukraine.

At the same time, the Chief of General Staff will speak of clandestine cyber offensives from abroad which can affect not only public institutions, but the lives of ordinary people in this country.

General Carter’s address, at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) comes at a time when the Government has come under severe criticism from politicians and former senior military officers for cutting back on defence spending. At the same time Russia has been blamed for cyber warfare on the West with claims of the US and European elections, as well as the Brexit referendum being targeted.

The Kremlin has showed its military prowess in the battlefield with missile strikes 1500km away in Syria. At the same time, Gen Carter maintains it has kept up constant sabre-rattling in Europe with simulated attacks.

“Our ability to pre-empt or respond to threats will be eroded if we don’t keep up with our adversaries. State-based competition is now being employed in more novel and increasingly integrated ways and we must be ready to deal with them,” Gen Carter will say.

“The threats we face are not thousands of miles away but are now on Europe’s doorstep – we have seen how cyber warfare can be both waged on the battlefield and to disrupt normal people’s lives. We in the UK are not immune from that.”

“We must take notice of what is going on around us or our ability to take action will be massively constrained. Speed of decision-making, speed of deployment and modern capability are essential if we wish to provide a realistic deterrence. The time to address these threats is now – we cannot afford to sit back.”

Britain and the West also need to be aware that conventional threats are still very present. “The traditional threat still remains and last year we saw Russia undertake simulated attacks across Northern Europe (from Kaliningrad to Lithuania), we must also look closely at how countries are now being more creative in how they exploit the seams between peace and war.”

Last month the head of the Armed Forces, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach warned that Russia poses a threat to Britain's internet access and trade because undersea communication cables are vulnerable to the country’s navy. Russia’s “modernised” navy has the ability to disrupt the transcontinental cables and that the UK had to bolster its naval forces to counter the threat.

Defence analysts have pointed out that the UK currently has had no submarine-hunting maritime patrol aircraft since 2010 while ships and submarines which could also protect the cables have fallen too.

"Baltic Subsea Cables: A Story of Resilience, Not Fear","Explores the resilience of subsea cables after incidents, detailing human-caused damage to C-Lion and BCS East-West Interlink cables.","https://pulse.internetsociety.org/blog/baltic-subsea-cables-a-story-of-resilience-than-fear","2024-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","Jane Ruffino",Yes,"Jane Ruffino","Reston, Virginia, USA","3764","2024-11-22","English","Internet Society","**In short**

*   Around 150 subsea cable faults occur annually, usually caused by accidental damage from a ship’s anchor or fishing trawler.
*   Despite this, the recent subsea cable faults in the Baltic Sea has caused many to speculate foul play.
*   The narrative of the story should highlight the resilience of subsea cables and the Internet as a whole to continue working despite these and other faults.

Around 99% of all Internet traffic runs through nearly 600 subsea cable systems worldwide. These (primarily) fiber optic connections are the latest generation of a more than 160-year-old practice of spanning seas, lakes, and oceans with watertight cables to carry telecommunications traffic.

Governments and the general public are increasingly aware of these systems. Still, this awareness usually comes in the form of stories about suspected attacks on them, and these stories are only sometimes grounded in evidence.

Two subsea cables (C-LIon and BCS East-West Interlink) in the Baltic Sea were reportedly damaged on 17 and 18 November 2024.

Governments in the region responded quickly. The foreign ministers of Finland and Germany issued a joint statement saying that European security is at risk from ""hybrid warfare by malicious actors."" CNN quickly picked up on this, using ""hybrid warfare"" in a headline, implying that it was the explanation. Boris Pistorius, Germany’s Defense Minister, even said, ""Nobody believes that these cables were accidentally severed.""

In contrast, the European Subsea Cables Association, an industry body that promotes the protection of subsea infrastructure, also responded that there isn’t enough evidence to draw a clear conclusion. They emphasized that this early speculation can be a catalyst for spreading misinformation and ""leads to unhelpful and premature conclusions being drawn about the cause of cable damage.""

All that’s known so far is that the cables were damaged by ""outside activity,"" which is sometimes labeled with ""external aggression."" But this refers to the fact that an object damaged a cable rather than an internal fault.

Human interaction is the most common cause of cable damage, usually accidental damage from a ship’s anchor or fishing trawler. It’s not possible to speculate on this incident, especially since the investigation isn’t finished, just to note that ""human activity"" as a cause does not clarify intent.

**Cable Breaks Are Common**  
Around 150 cable faults—breakage or other types of damage—occur globally each year, and the industry is always prepared for them. Repair kits are kept in ports, and when a cable is damaged, one of the world’s 60 cable ships—there are always some on standby—is dispatched to pick up the kit and travel out to lift the cable from the seabed and repair it.

Before the 2020s, cable incidents rarely received media attention unless they were remarkable in some way. For example, in 2016, three cables in the English Channel that served the island of Jersey were severed when a ship’s anchor dragged along the seabed. This cut the three main subsea connections with the UK and left the island reliant on a single connection with France. Users experienced slower connections, but Cloudflare reported that the traffic was rerouted through France relatively quickly. Most reductions in speed for users probably resolved themselves before the cable ship had even picked up the repair kit.

Until recently, the biggest myth the industry had to address was that shark bites were a risk to cables (they aren’t). In 2024, it seems every subsea cable fault without an immediate and obvious explanation is met with alarmist language from governments, which is picked up by the media, looking for a good story about international conflict rather than listening to industry experts like ESCA.

If it does emerge that this most recent cable fault has a national security dimension, the authorities might never be able to share it fully. In this instance, it’s also helpful to note that there was little impact on the Internet for users. RIPE Labs reported that the traffic was successfully rerouted, with a bit of extra latency but no meaningful increase in packet loss.

**The Baltic Sea Context**  
The Baltic Sea countries have been well-served by subsea cables since the mid-1990s when a combination of deregulation and post-Cold War activity helped trigger a boom in cable construction between the Nordic countries and the former East.

The Baltic cables are mostly what are called ""unrepeatered"" systems. These are used over shorter distances and don’t need a repeater as an internal power source, as the deep-sea cables that cross oceans do. Using an unrepeatered system is usually determined by geography, but these systems also provide extra route redundancy, which can lead to increased resilience of the overall network. The C-Lion, damaged in this incident, is one of the few repeatered systems in the Baltic, due to its length, but there aren’t many others.

The shorter-distance cables are powered from shoreline sheds and small landing stations, which are often so unobtrusive that you might not notice them. And while cable faults are common, it’s also common for cables to just sit on the seabed, doing their jobs, for decades. For example, in the Baltic, the main Estonia-Sweden cable went live in 1995, and until it was damaged by an anchor drag in 2023, there was no evidence that it had ever needed a repair before.

**Resilience is the Result of Continuous Human Activity**  
It’s important not to dismiss security concerns, but telling stories of resilience can help ensure that the combative language doesn’t wholly overshadow one of society’s most critical infrastructures.

**From a distance, resilience can look like inertia and, therefore, not much of a story. But resilience is incredibly active.**  
In the cable industry, it’s the product of things like good route planning, redundancy, proactive maintenance, and ongoing repair work—because in a resilient system, fallibility is expected and prepared for. And it’s all done by people, building relationships and working together in this tight-knit, highly collaborative industry.

It’s a worker on a cable ship, lowering a grappling hook into the sea to lift a damaged cable for repair. It’s the little celebrations at the shoreline when a new cable is pulled onto shore and connected in the beach manhole. It’s the delicate relationships that need to be developed to navigate complicated permitting processes across multiple nations’ waters. It’s the high-tech clean room where optical fibers are drawn from a many-storied tower, and the mid-century cable factory using a giant machine, which, thanks to regular maintenance, has survived longer than the first two companies that owned it, and has been armoring subsea cables since the 1950s. It’s ocean science researchers helping the industry address the effects of climate change. All in a telecommunications network built on more than 160 years of technology and human relationships.

When we look from a human-centered perspective, it’s still possible to account for security threats. We also activate the stories of the ""network of networks"" of people who are the reason that we never even know about the other 148 or so cable faults each year—or why the faults don’t happen at all.

*10 March 2015*

What would it take to bring down the internet? (Getty Images)  

The internet is unbreakable. At least, we think it is. That’s why when something goes extremely viral, such as pictures of Kim Kardashian’s bottom or #thedress, we joke about it ""breaking the internet"". This is because, well, that obviously isn’t going to happen – but we’re searching for some way of exaggerating the impact of the event. It’s a great piece of contemporary hyperbole. But could you really, literally, break the internet? And if so, does anyone really know for sure what would happen next?  

Part of the answer lies in London’s Docklands district: nestled just north-east of Canary Wharf is a large, unassuming building. Its grey, monolithic exterior is surrounded by a metal fence and there are security cameras dotted along its windowless walls. No hoardings or signage explains to passers-by what it is, or to whom it belongs. But it houses a substantial node in the internet. It’s called “Linx”, the London Internet Exchange, and it’s one of the biggest points of traffic exchange on the internet anywhere in the world. There are bigger exchanges out there, but not as many as you might think. Matthew Prince, CEO of content delivery network CloudFlare, puts the number of large facilities like Linx at “around 30”.  

These buildings, scattered across the globe, are where networks from providers like Virgin or Comcast come together to exchange their traffic. That, after all, is the whole point of an “inter”-net. And if any of them were cut off – by a power cut or earthquake, for instance – we would know about it.  

“You would actually see regional disruptions on the internet,” says Prince. “And if you were able to actually take out all 30 of those buildings, the internet itself would probably largely cease to function.”  

This sort of doomsday scenario isn’t very likely or feasible, though. These kinds of important internet facilities are extremely well protected, says Jack Waters, CTO of Level 3 – one of a handful of “Tier 1” network providers that are also crucial, because their big and resilient networks help form the backbone of the internet.  

“We have surveillance everywhere, we take all the appropriate precautions around barricades and those sorts of things. They are very hardened facilities,” he says. There has never been a known sabotage attempt at one of Level 3’s many buildings, he adds.  

What would happen if we cut the cables under the sea? Not as much as you might think (Thinkstock)  

Perhaps cutting the links between such places, then, would be an easier way to break the internet? There are uncountable miles of cables wrapped around the globe, and many of the biggest are just lying there unprotected – albeit often underwater. Indeed, cables do sometimes get severed just by accident, for instance during earthquakes or when ships’ anchors slice through them on the seabed. It’s believed that significant internet disruptions in 2008 that affected countries including Egypt were caused by these sort of cable breaks.  

**Distributed resilience**  

But the effects of these failures in the physical infrastructure of the net aren’t as far-reaching as you might think, because they come up against the original designed resilience of the system. It’s people like Paul Baran, a Polish-born American engineer, who we can thank for this. Baran is one of a few people who, way back in the early 1960s, believed a communications network could be designed with significant physical survivability, to withstand even a nuclear attack.  

He wrote many fascinating papers about it, but at first no-one took him seriously. It might have stayed like that except for Donald Davies, a Welsh computer scientist, who came up with the same fundamental idea as Baran, completely independently and at almost exactly the same time. Their idea was called “packet-switching” and it describes a communications protocol that breaks messages down into small blocks, or packets. These are fired across a network via the fastest route available – whatever that route is – until they all arrive at their destination, where they are then reassembled. Take out one link in the network, even an important one, and messages can still arrive where they are expected by taking one of the many alternative routes.  

To disrupt things, you don't need to cut the cable - just reroute the traffic (Thinkstock)  

It’s really clever. “It’s a spectacular architecture when you think about it,” says Waters. “End-to-end communication where the end points don’t care about what is in the middle is a very powerful idea.”  

That’s why cutting cables or throwing data centres offline does limited damage to the network at large. Even disconnecting entire regions, like Syria, won’t necessarily restrict internal communications within Syrian networks – though of course access to external websites like Google may no longer be possible.  

Eventually, though, people realised that the internet’s wonderful capacity to re-route traffic could be used against it. One such way is a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, in which a huge flow of traffic is deliberately sent to servers which can’t cope with the overload. DDoS attacks are becoming more and more common, and they are one of the threats which CloudFlare and other networks are designed to protect their clients against, says Prince. The ultra-high capacity of the CloudFlare network can simply absorb this “bad” traffic and redirect it, so that public websites under attack remain online. But dealing with the problem is getting more difficult all the time.  

(Thinkstock)  

“We’re definitely seeing an increase in the number of attacks, and an increase in the size and scale of those attacks,” explains Prince. “It becomes so easy to do them that sometimes they’re even used by rival businesses. We saw two feuding day spas the other day that were launching denial of service attacks against each other.”  

**Border breach**  

Another major concern is BGP hijacking. BGP stands for “border gateway protocol”. This is a key system which tells internet traffic – those billions of packets – where to go. For a long time, it was just assumed that the BGP routers positioned at various points across the network always sent the packets in the right direction. In recent years, however, it emerged that traffic could be surreptitiously re-directed if the destination information logged in the routers got manipulated, perhaps by hackers. Such hijacking would mean that huge swathes of internet data could effectively be stolen, or snooped on by third parties, such as intelligence agencies.  

The other potential consequence is that large portions of traffic could get sent to areas of the network that are more easily overwhelmed. Something like this happened a few years ago when Pakistan’s government tried to stop people in the country watching YouTube. BGP routes in Pakistan were changed, but this information was copied around the world. Huge numbers of people couldn’t access YouTube and all the traffic was instead sent to Pakistan, where the network infrastructure was quickly overloaded. It’s even been theorised that overloading routers with BGP updates could knock the entire internet offline.  

(Thinkstock)  

Re-routed traffic can cause unexpected headaches for the people who try to keep servers and online systems running. One blogger recently investigated what had sent a mail server offline only to discover mistakenly re-routed traffic was the cause. “While looking at IP addresses in my logs, I noticed something interesting: all of this traffic was coming from China,” he wrote.  

However, although most of these problems have been known to cause “disruption” – and some could, in theory, break the internet – there’s never been a case where the whole internet has gone down. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t think about the possibility, though, says Vincent Chan, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  

**Worst case**  

“I think a massive attack to bring down the whole internet is actually possible,” he says. He points out that physical attacks on the internet’s infrastructure are unlikely to do much permanent damage. Destroying one node in a 1,000 node network won’t take the whole network down, of course. But what if you find a software vulnerability that affects all 1,000 nodes? Then you’ve got a problem.  

“In that case, it’s not a 1,000 point independent failure, it’s only a one point failure,” he says. And Chan points out that there are methods of disrupting the internet that would be very hard to detect. In his lab he’s experimented with “splicing” a data signal and inserting high levels of noise. You could do this, he says, by going to low security junction boxes in remote locations around the world and simply putting a sabotaging black box between the electronics and the fibre optic cables.","The article discusses the implications of cutting undersea cables directly, explaining how such incidents could disrupt internet connectivity.

2 January 2018

By Laurence Peter, BBC News

The Yantar seen in the Bosphorus en route to Syria in 2017

**The Russian navy is very proud of its new spy ship, the Yantar, which is now doing Argentina a favour by helping to search for a missing submarine.**

Enter the Yantar, officially an oceanographic research vessel, but actually bristling with surveillance equipment, and the mother ship for manned and unmanned deep-sea submersibles.

A Russian ROV - remotely operated underwater vehicle - is scouring the ocean floor off Argentina.

The disappearance of the ARA San Juan remains a mystery.

**Targeting undersea cables**  
The Yantar's movements were apparently what prompted a warning last month from the UK military that Russia could disrupt or cut vital undersea communications cables.

Dozens of fibre-optic cables span the globe and Nato also has dedicated military cables on the ocean floor.

The Yantar is capable of tampering with them, says Igor Sutyagin, a London-based expert on the Russian military. But there is no evidence that it has done so.

""It's difficult to tap into optical fibres - it's just light inside, not electrical data,"" he told the BBC. ""It would be easier just to cut the cable.""

Mr Sutyagin noted that in the 1970s, during the Cold War, the US Navy had lost control of a Sosus undersea listening post for tracking submarines in the Atlantic. Sosus stands for ""Sound Surveillance System"".

The US military concluded that a Soviet submarine had cut the cables.

A news report from the Russian parliament says the Yantar can do just such clandestine work, using deep-diving submersibles.

**Spying on the US**  
The Russian parliamentary report noted that in the summer of 2015 the Yantar had deployed near the US Kings Bay naval base in Georgia.

""According to Pentagon officials, the Russians were gathering intelligence on US submarines' equipment, including underwater sensors in the DoDIN network,"" the Russian report said.

Mr Sutyagin said the US underwater sensors near Kings Bay would be interesting for the Russian military, which might wish to copy the US technology.

In late 2016 the Yantar was found to be loitering over undersea communications cables off the Syrian coast, including some links to Europe.

**Search and rescue**  
Besides the Argentina mission, the Yantar has been used previously for search and recovery.

The Russian parliamentary report said the ship had located two Russian fighter jets - a Su-33 and a MiG-29 - that crashed into the Mediterranean in 2016, during the Syria war.

The Yantar ""recovered secret equipment from the planes in good time"", the report said.

In 2000 a ship like the Yantar might have saved some Kursk sailors' lives and literally salvaged the Russian navy's reputation.","The article discusses the Russian spy ship Yantar and its capabilities, specifically mentioning its potential to disrupt or cut vital undersea communications cables.

This seems a very modern problem. However, in 1917, the United States and the British faced a similar problem, as a document in the National Archives shows.

On February 1, 1917, Germany launched unrestricted submarine warfare. Two days later the United States broke off diplomatic relations and began the slide toward war. On February 7, the British post office completed a study of what we would today call trans-Atlantic bandwidth to determine how much telegraph capacity would be available to an American Expeditionary Force that might be sent to France. In this era when the U.S. military blithely slings video-laden PowerPoint briefings back and forth across the NIPRNET (that’s the Internet to you and me), the numbers in this work are startling.

The study observed that there were 17 submarine telegraph cables connecting Europe and North America, two of them German. However, seven of the 17 were interrupted and three more were faulty. The overall transmission capacity of this degraded system was about 1.2 million words or 7.8 million letters per week in each direction. Put in today’s terminology, that is very roughly 7.8 megabytes per week each way. Of course, a great deal of that capacity was already spoken for. However, if a significant repair effort were launched, it might be possible to spare a total of some 3.9 megabytes per week each way for the Americans.

In early April, with the American declaration of war just days away, the British shared the study with the United States. The Americans were dismayed. Of course, radio transmissions could take up some of the burden but they realized that this technology, then still in its infancy, could pick up only a tiny proportion of the trans-Atlantic communications burden.

Then things got worse. As Professor Jonathan Winkler tells us in his book _Nexus: Strategic Communications and American Security in World War I_, in mid-February, a German U-boat cut a series of cables connecting Britain, Portugal, Gibraltar and the Azores. To compound the matter, in the summer of 1917, the German Navy began planning a major offensive against the cables. They equipped submarines with specialized grapples and cutting equipment and in mid-January 1918 launched their effort, which continued as late as September 1918. While the Germans were never able to achieve strategic effects by cutting numerous cables in a short period of time, they did make the bandwidth problem even worse and kept the Allies and Americans constantly on the defensive.

As a result of all this, the U.S. government had to struggle throughout the war to conduct its military, naval, and diplomatic business overseas. The Atlantic cable bottleneck had other strategic implications, as well. Winkler describes in his book how the United States was motivated to invest heavily in radio technology and infrastructure and also to pursue its own network of cables after the war. These efforts helped set the stage for America’s global military, economic, and political dominance of the second half of the 20th century. There was another effect, too. With only a modest ability to communicate with Washington, Gen. John J. Pershing, the commander of the American Expeditionary Forces in France was far more independent of the War Department than his British and French counterparts were of their respective ministries in nearby London and Paris. Perhaps some of the present day conventions of American civil–military relations are due in part to that legacy.

Ultimately, the system adapted to the inadequacies of the trans-Atlantic cable system and the German efforts to exacerbate them. While the United States was unable to operate as it might have wanted during World War I because of the submarine cable problem, it learned and made itself stronger and more resilient. Certainly it will be unpleasant if Russia ever attacks the submarine cable system. However, history gives us some hope that if that does happen, the United States will find a way to adapt and overcome in the long run. With any luck, the foreknowledge of Russia’s potential moves has allowed the United States to already start adapting.","The article 'Trans-Atlantic Bandwidth: Then and Now' discusses the historical implications of submarine cables, particularly focusing on how German U-boats cut cables during World War I. It directly mentions 'submarine cables' and details the impact of these actions on trans-Atlantic communications, which were critical for military and diplomatic operations.

**Author:** Jonathan Yerushalmy  
**Published Date:** 08/08/2024  

It was the opening days of 2022, in the aftermath of a huge volcanic eruption, when Tonga went dark. The underwater eruption – 1,000 times more powerful than the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima – sent tsunami waves across Tonga’s nearby archipelago and blanketed the island’s white coral sands in ash.

The strength of the Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha’apai eruption severed internet connectivity with Tonga, causing a communication blackout at just the moment that a crisis was unfolding.

When the undersea cable that provides the country’s internet was restored weeks later, the scale of the disruption was clear. The lack of connectivity had hampered recovery efforts, while at the same time devastating businesses and local finances, many of which depend on remittances from abroad.

The disaster exposed the extreme vulnerabilities of the infrastructure that underpins the workings of the internet.

Contemporary life is really inseparable from an operational internet, says Nicole Starosielski, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley and the author of The Undersea Network.

In that way, it’s much like drinking water – a utility that underpins our very existence. And like water, very few people understand what it takes for it to travel from a distant reservoir to our kitchen taps.

Modern consumers have come to imagine the internet as something unseen in the atmosphere – an invisible “cloud” just above our heads, raining data down upon us. Because our devices aren’t tethered to any cables, many of us believe the whole thing is wireless, says Starosielski, but the reality is far more extraordinary.

Almost all internet traffic – including Zoom calls, movie streams, emails and social media feeds – reach us via high speed fibre optics laid on the ocean floor. These are the veins of the modern world, stretching almost 1.5 million km under the sea, connecting countries via physical cables which funnel the internet through them.

Speaking via WhatsApp, Starosielski explains that the data transmitting her voice will travel from her mobile phone to a nearby cell tower. “That’s basically the only wireless hop in the entire system,” she says.

From the cell tower, it will go through a set of terrestrial fibre optic cables, travelling at the speed of light underground. It will then go to a cable landing station – usually somewhere near the water – and from there to the bottom of the seafloor, before coming up at a cable landing station in Australia, from where the Guardian is speaking to Starosielski.

**Spies, sabotage and sharks**  
That the data that powers financial, government, and some military communications is traversing cables not much thicker than a hose pipe and protected by little more than the seawater above them, has in recent years become a cause of concern for lawmakers across the world.

In 2017, Nato officials reported that Russian submarines had stepped up their surveillance of internet cables in the north Atlantic and in 2018, the Trump administration sanctioned a Russian company that was alleged to have provided “underwater capabilities” to Moscow, with the aim of monitoring the underwater network.

A Russian attack on undersea cables would cause “significant damage to our economy and to our everyday lives,” Jim Langevin, a member of the US house armed services committee said at the time.

The targeting of internet cables is a weapon that Russia has long held in its arsenal of hybrid warfare. When Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, Moscow severed the main cable connection to the peninsula, gaining control of its internet infrastructure, enabling the Kremlin to spread disinformation.

Global conflicts have also been shown to have unintended, disruptive effects on internet cable systems. In February, Iranian-backed Houthi militants attacked a cargo ship in the Red Sea. The eventual sinking of the Rubymar was likely responsible for severing three undersea cables in the region, which disrupted a significant portion of internet traffic between Asia and Europe.

The US and its allies have also expressed serious concern that adversaries could tap into the undersea cables to obtain “personal information, data, and communications.” A 2022 congressional report on the issue highlighted the increased potential of Russia or China to access the undersea cable systems.

It’s a method of espionage that the US is all too familiar with: in 2013 the Guardian revealed that the UK’s GCHQ had tapped into the network of internet cables to access vast quantities of communications between entirely innocent people, as well as targeted suspects. This information was then passed on to the NSA.

The documents, revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden, also showed that an undersea cable that connects Australia and New Zealand to the US was tapped to allow the NSA to access Australian and New Zealand internet data.

Despite the raft of dangers and the increasingly vocal warning from western governments, calls for greater action in securing the cable network have largely gone unanswered and many see the threats as overblown.

“There are no publicly available and verified reports indicating deliberate attacks on the cable network by any actor, be it Russia, China, or a non-state group,” a 2022 EU report said.

“Arguably, this implies that the threat scenarios being discussed could be exaggerated.”

One expert speaking to the Guardian was blunter in their assessment, describing the threat of sabotage as “bullshit.""

The data bears this out, showing that sharks, anchors and fishing pose a greater threat to the global internet infrastructure than Russian spies. A US report on this issue showed that the major threats to the network are “accidental incidents involving humans”. On average, a cable is severed “every three days.”

“A submarine telecommunication cable was accidentally severed by a ship off the coast of Somalia in 2017, leading to a three-week internet outage costing the country $10 million a day”, the report states.

**An Unequal Internet**  
For many experts however, the greatest risk to the internet isn’t sabotage, espionage, or even rogue anchors – but the uneven spread of the cable infrastructure that threads across the globe, binding the world’s digital networks together.

“There aren’t cables everywhere,” says Starosielski. “There is a concentration in the north Atlantic Ocean connecting the United States and Europe but there are not that many in the South Atlantic.”

“So you see that some parts of the world have a high level of connectivity … and diversity in terms of having multiple routes in case there’s a break.”

As of 2023 there were more than 500 communications cables at the bottom of the ocean, but a quick glance at the map of the world’s undersea cable networks shows they are largely centred around economic and population centres.

The unequal spread of cables is clearest in the Pacific, where a territory like Guam, with a population of just 170,000 and which houses a US naval base, has more than 10 internet cables connecting to the island. New Zealand, with more than 5 million people has seven. Tonga has just one.

In the aftermath of the 2022 eruption in Tonga, governments across the world were spurred into action, commissioning reports into the vulnerabilities within the existing undersea cable network, while tech companies worked to bolster networks to ensure such an event never occurred again.

Last month, Tonga’s internet went down again.

Huge parts of the country were left in the dark after the undersea internet cable connecting the island network was damaged, causing chaos for local businesses.

For now, the economic fundamentals favour the building of more cables across the western world and into emerging markets, where the digital demand is booming. Despite the warnings of sabotage or accidental damage – experts say that without the market imperative to create more resilient networks, the real risk is that places like Tonga will continue to go dark, threatening the very promise of digital equity that the internet was founded on.","The article discusses the importance of undersea cables for internet connectivity, detailing specific incidents where such cables were severed, including the case of Tonga after a volcanic eruption.

"Under the Sea: The Vulnerability of the Commons","Explores the critical role of undersea cables in global communications; discusses vulnerabilities to natural disasters and human activities.","https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/commons/under-sea","2023-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","Robert Martinage",Yes,"Robert Martinage","New York, NY, US","20000","2023-01-23","English","Foreign Affairs Magazine","In recent years, U.S. officials have grown increasingly fearful of a massive cyberattack, one capable of crippling infrastructure and crashing markets. In 2010, William Lynn, then deputy secretary of defense, wrote in these pages that cyberspace was “just as critical to military operations as land, sea, air, and space.” As defense secretary, Leon Panetta warned of a “cyber–Pearl Harbor.” And in 2013, James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, put cyberattacks at the top of his annual list of transnational threats.

Yet as Washington has poured billions of dollars into shoring up its defenses in the virtual world, it has largely ignored the physical infrastructure that allows cyberspace to exist in the real one. Today, roughly 95 percent of intercontinental communications traffic—e-mails, phone calls, money transfers, and so on—travels not by air or through space but underwater, as rays of light that traverse nearly 300 fiber-optic cables with a combined length of over 600,000 miles. For the most part, these critical lines of communication lack even basic defenses, both on the seabed and at a small number of poorly guarded landing points. And a mounting tally of small-scale breaches points to the potential for large-scale damage.

Washington’s neglect of undersea infrastructure extends beyond cables to an increasingly important source of global oil and gas supply: deep-water drilling. Today, offshore rigs in the Gulf of Mexico account for some 25 percent of total U.S. oil and gas production—a figure the Department of Energy predicts could reach 40 percent by 2040. Outside the United States, global production from deep-water wells has risen from 1.5 million barrels per day in 2000 to over six million barrels per day in 2014. As the infrastructure for offshore drilling grows more sophisticated and widespread, it is also becoming more susceptible to attack, with the potential consequences exceeding those of the giant 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

Although human activities underwater are regulated by numerous international bodies, no single entity has both the authority and the ability to take the lead. In the United States, the Coast Guard is responsible for enforcing security plans at the largest offshore energy platforms and protecting underwater structures at some ports. Yet no government agency or department has responsibility for the defense of the country’s submerged energy and cable infrastructure. As a consequence, two of the most critical sectors of the U.S. economy—communications and energy—could easily fall prey to a well-organized terrorist plot or a foreign attack. Fortunately, Washington still has time to correct course.

WHAT LIES BENEATH

British engineers laid the first submarine telegraph line across the English Channel in 1850. Eight years later, an effort backed by the American financier Cyrus Field bridged the Atlantic, linking Ireland to Newfoundland with a telegraph wire that eventually transmitted almost seven words per minute. After Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876, the first underwater telephone cable soon followed, carrying conversations beneath the San Francisco Bay.

Although the number of cables proliferated, their speed and capacity stagnated until the introduction of two key advances during the 1920s and 1930s: coaxial copper cores and polyethylene insulation, which allowed individual cables to carry multiple voice channels and provided improved durability. In subsequent decades, capacity soared, rising from 36 voice channels per cable in the 1950s to around 4,000 in the 1970s. Nevertheless, installation and maintenance costs remained high, making satellites decidedly more attractive for carrying telephone traffic. Until the 1980s, satellites could provide almost ten times as much capacity as submarine cables while requiring only one-tenth as large an investment.

But then fiber-optic technology revolutionized global communications. In 1988, a consortium of British, French, and U.S. telecommunications firms laid the first fiber-optic cable across the Atlantic. TAT-8, as the line was called, could carry 40,000 telephone calls simultaneously—an order of magnitude greater than most existing coaxial cables could handle and at a fraction of the previous cost. Today’s fiber-optic cables can transmit an amount of data equivalent to the entire printed collection of the Library of Congress in about 20 seconds.

As a result, companies, governments, and individuals can send and receive more data than ever before. In 1993, Internet users transmitted around 100 terabits of data in a year; today, they send about 150 terabits every second. And this number is expected to exceed 1,000 terabits by 2020, fueled in large part by the expansion of cellular networks in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.

Nearly all that data will travel along the seabed. Imagine, then, how damaging a determined attack on undersea infrastructure could be. One need only consider the destruction possible from natural causes and inadvertent interference. In 2006, an undersea earthquake near Taiwan snapped nine cables. It took 11 ships 49 days to finish repairs, while China, Japan, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam lost critical communication links, disrupting regional banking, markets, and trade. In 2007, Vietnamese fishermen seeking to salvage copper from a defunct coaxial cable pulled up active lines instead, disrupting Vietnam’s communications with Hong Kong and Thailand for nearly three months and requiring repairs that cost millions. Given the scarcity of equipment and personnel, it could take months, if not years, for the United States to recover from a large-scale, coordinated assault. Attackers wouldn’t even need to target U.S. assets, since U.S. traffic flows through more than a dozen other countries that serve as major hubs for the global undersea cable network.

Much of this infrastructure allows the global economy to function. Every day, SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, transmits some 20 million messages to more than 8,000 banking organizations, security institutions, and corporate customers in nearly 200 countries, reconciling trillions of dollars’ worth of assets across global financial markets. Intercontinental Exchange, which operates a global network of currency exchanges and clearing-houses, typically processes over ten million contracts each day, covering the energy, commodity, financial, and equity derivatives markets. Without the undersea fiber-optic network, this type of electronic banking and commerce simply could not happen. And in the event that the cable system shut down, millions of transactions would be cut short.

Thanks to a number of factors, moreover, a major attack turns out to be surprisingly feasible. For one, fiber-optic cables, which are typically one to two inches thick, generally follow routes that avoid high-traffic shipping lanes, fishing areas, and sensitive environmental locations. Although that helps minimize the risk of accidental damage, it means that cables tend to land at only about two dozen major sites around the world. Of the roughly 40 major submarine cables that connect the United States to the world’s global undersea communications network, nearly all make landfall at narrow stretches of coast in California, Florida, New Jersey, New York, and Oregon. On the East Coast, nearly every transatlantic cable comes ashore within only tens of miles of one another in the New York–New Jersey area.

To make matters worse, maps of many cable routes are easily accessible to the public. Every year, operators report around 100 to 150 cases of major damage, roughly 70 percent of which are the result of human activities such as fishing and anchoring. That’s why submarine cable locations appear on nautical charts. Some cables even have acoustic beacons to make them easier to find. Information about global cable routes, meanwhile, is available on the Internet, making it easy to discern a given country’s weak spots.

With detailed coordinates at their fingertips, foreign militaries could target U.S. cables using remote-controlled submarines equipped with high-resolution sonar and loaded with explosives. The barrier to entry for this type of undersea warfare is relatively low, as several different companies now sell such technology on the consumer market. In fact, thousands of undersea vehicles, operated semiautonomously or remotely, are already in service worldwide. A well-financed terrorist group could easily get its hands on one in order to target key cables and junction points. It could also opt for brute force, using fishing trawlers equipped with deep-sea grappling hooks to maul cables in shallower waters.

The global undersea cable network does have a good deal of spare capacity, enabling the swift rerouting of global communications traffic in the event of an emergency like the 2006 Taiwan earthquake. Yet a well-planned attack could take this into account, targeting multiple intercontinental submarine cables, shore-based terminals, and coastal connection points. In the attack’s aftermath, service providers would likely struggle to cooperate, scrambling to repair their own networks by hoarding skilled personnel and scarce hardware.

CRUDE AWAKENING

The first offshore oil rigs appeared in California in 1896, not long after the first undersea telephone lines were put in place. But the industry stalled for decades. In the late 1940s, drilling came to a virtual standstill owing to disputes between state and federal authorities over the power to issue leases for oil exploration. But in 1953, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower, who had campaigned on the issue, passed legislation empowering states to grant leases for activity up to three (and in some cases nine) nautical miles from the coastline and the U.S. Department of the Interior to sign off on drilling in areas beyond state jurisdiction.

Jackson School of International Studies, University of Washington","Internationally, Snowden’s revelation about the extent of U.S government surveillance was met with great anger. Governments began asking questions about what could be done to avoid U.S. surveillance. The BRICS—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—had already begun thinking about the idea of a global Internet without the U.S. at its center, but Snowden’s release provided the impetus to propel the issue. One element of this was the development of a BRICS undersea cable system. Undersea cables are one of the physical elements of the Internet, carrying the Internet around the globe.

The BRICS cable was slated for completion in mid-2015. However, the cable has not been completed and there no longer appears to be an active discussion about its creation. The fate of the BRICS cable is a lesson in how U.S. domestic cybersecurity policy can impact international debates about the future of the global Internet. It is also a lesson in how difficult coordination can be among countries with similar concerns about U.S. policy, but very different orientations to information and Internet governance.

BRICS Cable Background

The initial announcement of the BRICS Cable was in either 2012 or early 2013, although it did not gain significant political traction or media attention until after the Edward Snowden leaks of September 2013. For instance, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff was furious about the revelation of American espionage upon her government.

The BRICS Cable was meant to circumvent the U.S. and NSA spying through ports in Russia, China, Singapore, India, Mauritius, South Africa, and Brazil. The two-fibre cable was slated to cost $1.5 billion, span 34,000 kilometers in length, and feature a 12.8 Tbit/s capacity system. The cable would hook up with the SEACOM, EASSY, and WACS cables, linking the Internet infrastructure of BRIC nations to the rest of Africa.

Project leadership primarily came from Brazil and South Africa. While Brazil provided the political impetus for the project, South African Andrew Mthembu, executive chairman of the investment group Imphandze, became the de-facto spokesperson for the project. Mthembu has advocated for the BRICS cable and worked to develop consortium-level funding worldwide.

In spite of Mthembu’s efforts, the BRICS Cable project appears stalled in 2015. The domain www.bricscable.com is no longer in use and finding information about the project’s status is exceedingly difficult. The cable does not have a definitive ready-for-service date nor are there any indicators on the progress of its physical completion.

BRICS Politics

The exact reasons for the stalling of the BRICS Cable are unclear but can probably be traced to outstanding financial and political issues plaguing the BRICS consortium.

The 2014 Submarine Telecoms Industry Report, written by Terabit Consulting, reports that the BRICS Cable was unable to receive financing in its original form. This is perhaps unsurprising given the considerable financial and logistical feat of coordinating dozens of different operators in different countries and on different continents.

In addition to funding problems, the BRICS group is hindered by political division within the BRICS bloc itself. These disagreements often occur along differing lines of governance and political values. India, Brazil, and South Africa (IBSA) are united in their democratic governments and share a vision for a world with better respect for human rights shaped by multi-stakeholder input. Russia and China are on the other end of the spectrum, placing little emphasis upon multi-stakeholder governance, instead championing strong state focused control. In addition, Russia and China are bound to one another not only through the BRICS process, but also through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which is perhaps a more effective vehicle for the advancement of their joint political and economic ventures.

The political divisions exist in spite of deepening BRICS integration in recent years. The idea of a BRIC grouping was first coined by Goldman Sachs in 2001 and regular meetings between Brazil, India, and China began in 2006. South Africa joined in 2010. Since then, the BRICS have expressed interest in a new global reserve currency, the creation of a New Development Bank, and Russia has proposed a BRICS information technology alliance.

Additionally, the BRICS nations have made significant progress in the institutionalization of their discussions surrounding Internet governance. However, no tangible agreements have emerged from these meetings. The BRICS nations agree that an Internet code of conduct must be developed, but they cannot agree upon what this code should include. In fact, these meetings have recently produced more intra-bloc disconnect than political harmonization. At the 2015 BRICS summit in Ufa, Russia, India announced its “Indian Vision for the Internet.” India announced its desire to move from state-led Internet governance to a more multi-stakeholder perspective. India’s stance angered Russia, who traditionally views India as a political ally both within the BRICS bloc and outside it.

Therefore, although the BRICS are united in their desire for alternatives to a United States-led global order, they are fundamentally divided upon how to complete this task. The absence of bloc cohesion may be the factor underlying the stalling of the BRICS cable.

From the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century, laying undersea cables to establish a telegraph communication network for the British Empire was a major geopolitical policy.  

Vast submarine telegraph cables were put in place, including one running westward from the U.K. under the Atlantic Ocean, one between the U.K. and France, and one stretching southward around Africa and eventually reaching Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean.  

In the 21st century, the undersea cables were replaced with fiber optic wires, and the network’s main role changed to distribution of digital data via the internet.

While many of us are busy worrying about an internet apocalypse at the hands of IoT bots, there are many other ways the global network could be brought to its knees. A little over 350 of them, in fact, are lying at the bottom of the ocean.

Submarine cables stretch across the world, managing almost all the internet’s traffic between them. That’s everything from financial settlement systems through to voice and video calls.

Content distribution networks help to take the load off both systems by situating oft-repeated content closer to its audience, but it must still get to those staging points in the first place.

Typically, when a submarine cable goes down the causes are mundane. A ship dragging its anchor along the seabed was reportedly responsible for cutting direct connections between the UK mainland and the Channel Islands in late November, for example. As a result, telecoms firm JT had to route all traffic to and from the Channel Islands via an alternative link with France.

When human ineptitude isn’t to blame for submarine cable outages, it’s most often nature – earthquakes, cyclones and the like – that take over. But what about intentional human intervention?

We have seen signs of attacks in the past, such as the incident in Egypt in 2013, when three divers were caught attempting to cut undersea cables (although they later said it was a mistake).

Analysts tell us that simple redundancy will protect us, and as the Channel Islands incident showed, there are typically multiple points of redundancy in undersea fibre-optic networks.

These levels of redundancy vary around the world, though, with historically proven single points of failure at several locations along the top of Africa and in south-east Asia.

Even in countries with more developed connections, targeting multiple ingress and egress points could create significant service disruptions.

We have seen what appear to be malicious attacks on cables before. In 2008, the cables connecting Sicily to Egypt were cut, reportedly choking off traffic between Europe and Asia.

Submarine cables are unprotected in deep waters, simply lying on the seafloor. Closer to the coastline, they are often protected by a galvanized coating and shallowly buried.

Then they come ashore, often connecting to terrestrial fibre underneath access covers next to the beach or in small, anonymous-looking concrete buildings. All these points are potentially vulnerable to different kinds of physical attack.

Experts point out that submarine cables can always be repaired. The question is, how long would this take? It took around two weeks to get the three severed Channel Islands cables back up and running – though this was partly because the ship originally assigned to the job was called away to another.

There are only so many vessels able to perform this highly specialized job, and they’ve been known to face attacks of their own. What would happen if the global fleet were taxed too heavily?

While it may sound like the plot of a Bond movie, the reality is, such attacks are enough of a threat that the Pentagon is taking notice. Recent reports suggest that the US is getting particularly worried about Russian submarine and spy ship activities around undersea cable routes.

Companies such as Microsoft and Google are building out their own submarine fibre, probably more for cost reasons than for resiliency.

On land, and over short stretches of water such as the English Channel, microwave is also proving a lower-latency option than fibre for companies particularly worried about that kind of thing.

Neither hyperscale-owned fibre or bank-commissioned microwave may be predicated on resiliency but it’s certainly a side benefit. For those companies not rich enough to build out their own private internet backbone, however, a little planning might be necessary to ensure that traffic is channelled along several redundant routes.

While corporate providers mull these options, consumers will just have to cross their fingers and hope for the best when they settle down to a video call with Grandma half a world away.","The article discusses submarine cables extensively, including direct mentions of incidents where cables were cut, such as the Channel Islands incident and the 2008 incident affecting traffic between Europe and Asia.

The fear is that the Russians might sever the fiber-optic cables at a strategic time to greatly inhibit worldwide Internet connectivity. “It would be the biggest disruption to your internet service since your upstairs neighbor put a password on his WiFi,” Colbert said. Other non–nation state threats to the cables include [natural disasters](http://www.osa-opn.org/home/articles/volume_25/march_2014/features/sea_change_the_challenges_facing_submarine_optical/#.VjqAbqK4BrY) and [sharks](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/08/15/shark_attacks_threaten_google_s_undersea_internet_cables_video.html).

The host talked about the return of Cold War–era anxieties, something the [_New York Times_ also raised](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/world/europe/russian-presence-near-undersea-cables-concerns-us.html?_r=0) when it noted last week that “\[t\]he issue goes beyond old worries during the Cold War that the Russians would tap into the cables.”

But Colbert also used the news story as an opportunity to teach people about the infrastructure of the Internet. “First of all—what is the Internet doing underwater?” he joked. “Last time I checked I’m not supposed to get my computer wet. … What happened to the cloud? I was told there was a cloud.” It may sound silly, but it’s not unimportant to remind people that the Internet isn’t quite the omnipresent spirit entity it appears to be. Connectivity exists because of very real physical infrastructure.

So to prepare for a possible digital blackout, Colbert packed an “Internet Outage Go-Bag,” which included a photo of a baby, printouts of local restaurant recommendations and movie times, and a thick stack of racist tweets. Plus, “To replace YouTube you, of course, are going to want to get a cat. Preferably one dressed in a tuxedo.”

[According to the BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42481216), Russian media report the Admiral Gorshkov, a new guided-missile frigate, is still undergoing trials.

You panic when even a few drops of water fall on your laptop. Everyone knows that water and electronics don’t “mix.” That’s why it seems so ironic that most of the Internet’s “hard” infrastructure lies underwater on the ocean floor.

Virtually all global data travels through millions of miles of [submarine fiber optic cables](https://www.ofsoptics.com/transoceanic-telecom/) beneath the ocean’s surface. More than 350 subsea cable lines stretch from the U.S. West Coast to the East Coast, with many more [being deployed to connect countries around the world](https://www.ofsoptics.com/melting-arctic-ice-could-mean-faster-internet/).

Installing submarine fiber optic cables deep on the ocean floor is time consuming and expensive. While special ships deploy the cable, ocean divers repair and maintain the network. And even with thick, protective jackets, there are many ways to damage a cable. Some destructive forces include ship anchors, commercial fishing equipment, earthquakes, hurricanes and even [sinister interference](https://www.ofsoptics.com/can-quantum-networks-hacker-proof-fiber-optic-cables/).

**HOW UNDERSEA CABLES ARE LAID**

Laying undersea cables requires the combined efforts of explorers, navigators, and engineers.

Explorers must understand the ocean floor in order to identify the best route for laying the cable. They use sonar technology to map out the terrain and locate any potential obstacles that may impede the cable’s progress. Navigators are responsible for ensuring that the cable is laid in a straight line and that it follows the planned route. Engineers must design and build the cable, as well as ensure its integrity during installation.

Once the cable is laid, it must be tested for performance and reliability. This is done by sending a signal through the cable and measuring its speed and accuracy. If any problems are detected, they must be addressed before the cable can be put into service.

**I SPY WITH MY LITTLE EYE**

For years, NATO forces and our military have spotted Russian submarines and ships lurking around near the sites of key intercontinental cables. The U.S. and our allies worry about Russia’s interest in these submarine fiber optic cables that carry most of the world’s data, e-mails and texts. Just as troubling, these cables transmit $10 trillion in financial transactions each day. Is Russia interested in cutting or tapping the cables? Does it want us to worry that it might? Or is there a more innocent explanation? Whatever it might be, Russia isn’t talking.

Enemies have threatened undersea cables before. During World War II and the Cold War, our foes targeted Allied copper underwater cables and wires. More recently, British and American intelligence agencies eavesdropped on submarine fiber optic cables, according to documents released by Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor.

**TAKING A JUMP FORWARD**

Until recently, [service providers](https://www.ofsoptics.com/fttx-solutions/) banded together to install and maintain underwater cable networks. In this arrangement, each provider owns part of the data transmitted through the [cables](https://www.ofsoptics.com/fiber-optic-cable/).

However, tech companies like Facebook, Google and Microsoft are now deploying their own subsea cable networks for exclusively private use. Virtually anyone can easily identify these network locations on public maps. Cutting one cable might have a limited impact. However, damaging several at the same time or at choke points could create a major outage.

Not to change subjects, but this might be a good time to backup your inbox on a hard drive in a very dry place. Like most types of infrastructure, we only notice when it breaks.

_**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**_

How thick are undersea cables?

Modern submarine fiber optic cables are typically between 0.8 and 1.2 inches thick. They are made up of multiple layers of protective material, such as Kevlar, around a single glass fiber core. The outermost layer is usually a polyethylene coating to protect the cable from the environment.

Do the cables really rest on the ocean floor’s surface?

Yes, cables extend all the way down. Cables are buried under the seabed near the shore for protection, which explains why you don’t see them when you go to the beach.

How many kilometers of cable are there?

We estimate that nearly 1.4 million kilometers of submarine cables will be in service by early 2023.

Published on **15 February 2023**  
Updated on **13 June 2024**  

Submarine cables are the backbone of the Internet and many other communication networks, connecting countries and continents around the world. As we rely increasingly on digital communication for business, financial and personal needs, the submarine cable network has become the backbone of the global economy. Thus, their vulnerability is the vulnerability of modern society. Seabed cables can be vulnerable to damage caused by natural disasters or malicious actors. In this blog post, we will dive deep into understanding the physical, electronic, and legal protection of seabed cables.

### What are submarine cables?  
Seabed cables transmit data, voice, and video information between countries or continents by using fibre-optic technology. More than 1 million kilometres of submarine cables crisscross oceans and seas.  
Technologically speaking, seabed cables contain fibre of glass that permit the transmission of light signals over great distances. Light signals carry digital data from email and blogs to YouTube and Netflix, to name a few.

### What is the difference between seabed, submarine, and underwater cables?  
Seabed cables, submarine cables, and underwater cables are often used interchangeably. Typically, they are made of fibre optic materials, and they lay beneath the surface of oceans and seas. Other terms are used such as underwater cables.

### What is the history of seabed cables?  
Seabed cables aren’t new. The first cables connected Britain and France in 1850s. A few decades later, the first trans-Atlantic cable connected Great Britain and the United States. Since then, seabed cables have grown in number and complexity.

### Why are seabed cables important for the internet?  
Without seabed cables, the internet we know won’t exist. They carry internet traffic from email to YouTube videos. You are reading these lines from data that is transmitted via one of the seabed cables. These cables carry billions of bits of data transmitted across continents in milliseconds. All in all, seabed cables represent an important part of the architecture that makes our digital lives possible today.

### Can satellites replace submarine cables as the main communication infrastructure?  
Not yet. Seabed cables carry most of the global traffic. While satellite technology, such as SpaceX, can provide efficient local access, it is not yet a solution for data traffic across oceans and long distances. Nevertheless, advances in satellite technology may change it. For example, laser transmission between satellites can provide high bandwidth and fast speed comparable to seabed cables.

### How are seabed cables protected?  
Protection of submarine cables involves physical, electronic, and legal measures.

#### Physical protection of seabed cables  
Most seabed cables are buried between 1-2 meters below the seabed. This creates an extra layer of physical protection for seabed cables from trawlers and anchors, which may cause physical damage to seabed cables. This protection is achieved by seabed dredging and cable burial in trenches. Cables are also protected by armour, a protective shield that prevents them from being damaged by marine life and underwater hazards. Cable armour is made from heavy-duty materials like steel, and armoured polyethene, which provides the extra layer of protection seabed cables require to survive in the deep ocean environment.

#### Electronic protection of seabed cables  
Electronic monitoring systems protect seabed cables from damage and destruction. These systems detect any changes or anomalies in the seabed environment and alert operators if there is potential for harm to seabed cables. Data transmitted via seabed cables are protected electronically with an end-to-end encryption system. This reduces the risk of tapping into the seabed cables and spying on the transmitted data.

#### Legal protection of seabed cables  
Within territorial waters, seabed cables are protected by national regulations. At the open sea, seabed cables are protected by the provisions of the Law of the Sea Convention (LOS). Firstly, LOS sets the rules for the construction and maintenance of seabed cables. Secondly, it limits activities such as fishing or anchoring that could damage the cable somehow. Finally, the LOS specifies which country has jurisdiction over seabed cables.

### How can we reduce the risks for the internet from seabed cable disruption?  
Despite all measures to protect submarine cables, the risks remain. However, some of the following activities could reduce these risks for the normal functioning of the internet.

#### Diversification via more submarine cables  
The more internet cables we have, the less risk there will be. Adding more seabed cables will give us failover options in case of disruption. Internet traffic can be redirected from damaged seabed cables to alternative ones.

#### Better satellite communication  
Advancements in satellite technology could provide another channel for internet traffic. The internet infrastructure could be more stable if there were more satellite constellations with more bandwidth and speed.

#### Internet exchange points  
Internet exchange points (IXPs) connect a few networks at the country and community levels. In this way, they keep traffic local without using international internet cables.

### Conclusion  
Seabed cables are a crucial part of our digital infrastructure and must be protected physically, electronically and legally. Physical protection is achieved by seabed dredging and cable burial in trenches. Electronic monitoring systems pick up on any changes or oddities in the environment of the seabed and let operators know if there are risks of cable disruption. Data transmitted via seabed cables are protected electronically with an end-to-end encryption system. Finally, seabed cables are protected by the provisions of the Law of the Sea Convention (LOS) and national laws.

The risks for overall internet from cable disruptions can also be reduced by having more cables, advancements in satellite technology, and the development of internet exchange points.

Together, these measures reduce risks for seabed cables. However, given their high importance for modern society, seabed cables must be made even more robust, in particular, via international legal protection.","The article discusses submarine cables extensively, addressing their importance, vulnerabilities, and the protective measures needed to ensure their integrity.

**Author**: Holly Elizabeth Matley

**Published Date**: 08/21/2019

**Abstract**: Submarine cables are vital to the global economy and the national security of States. While their importance and role in transmitting most of the world's data and communications is increasingly being recognised by States, the legal regime governing submarine cables is often characterised as a neglected area of the law of the sea. The security implications arising from an intentional attack on international submarine cables cannot be underestimated. Despite the significant security risks and vulnerabilities, the legal regime governing submarine cables is limited and there are a number of crucial gaps in the regulation of submarine cables. This article examines the existing legal options available to States to close the ‘security gap’ using the Australian experience as a case study. A number of respected commentators in this area have argued that the best way to close the security gap in the regulation of submarine cables would be to develop a new counter–terrorism convention to criminalise the intentional damage of international submarine cables. This article reflects on whether additional legal options are necessary or available to effectively close these gaps given the institutional, legal and political context surrounding the ‘orphan’ of international law: submarine cables.","The article discusses 'submarine cables' extensively, focusing on their legal and security implications, particularly regarding intentional damage.

It addresses the importance of these cables to global communications and highlights regulatory gaps, indicating that it treats the topic as central rather than a minor mention.

Therefore, it satisfies the criterion for being on the topic of cut sea cables."

Over the past few years, Russian sea units have popped up all over the borders of Britain’s territorial waters.

In January, three RAF Typhoon fighter jets and a British warship escorted a Russian aircraft carrier and other ships [up the English Channel](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-38750696/raf-typhoons-escort-russian-ships). In June 2016, the [Royal Navy intercepted](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/08/british-navy-intercepts-russian-submarine-channel-nato) a Russian Kilo-class submarine, capable of carrying cruise missiles and torpedoes, after detecting it in the North Sea.

Earlier this month, Britain’s most senior military officer also warned that [Russia is posing a threat](https://news.sky.com/story/uks-undersea-cables-at-risk-of-potentially-catastrophic-attack-by-russians-11171237) to undersea communications and internet cables. Air chief marshal Stuart Peach said any disruption to such communications would “immediately and potentially catastrophically” hurt the economy.

Russia could do damage even without its most advanced warships and submarines: According to [a recent report](https://policyexchange.org.uk/publication/undersea-cables-indispensable-insecure/) by think tank Policy Exchange, fishing trawlers with deep-sea grappling hooks could be used to carry out an attack on undersea cables and communications. ”Whether from terrorist activity or an increasingly bellicose Russian naval presence,” the report said, “the threat of these vulnerabilities being exploited is growing.

Recently, a [_New York Times_ article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/world/europe/russian-presence-near-undersea-cables-concerns-us.html) on Russian submarine activity near undersea communications cables dredged up Cold War politics and generated widespread recognition of the submerged systems we all depend upon.

Not many people realise that undersea cables transport nearly [100% of transoceanic data traffic](https://books.google.com/books?id=LQDXAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA362&dq=submarine+telecommunications+cables&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBGoVChMI5Pm8_oPyyAIVBG4-Ch379Al9#v=onepage&q=99&f=false). These lines are laid on the very bottom of the ocean floor. They’re about as thick as a garden hose and carry the world’s Internet, phone calls and even television transmissions between continents at the speed of light. A single cable can carry tens of terabits of information per second.

While researching my book [_The Undersea Network_](https://www.dukeupress.edu/The-Undersea-Network), I realised that the cables we all rely on to send everything from e-mail to banking information across the seas remain largely unregulated and undefended. Although they are laid by only a few companies (including the American company SubCom and the French company Alcatel-Lucent) and often funnelled along narrow paths, the ocean’s vastness has often provided them protection.

The fact that we route Internet traffic through the ocean — amid deep-sea creatures and hydrothermal vents — runs counter to most people’s imaginings of the Internet. Didn’t we develop satellites and Wi-Fi to transmit signals through the air? Haven’t we moved to the cloud? Undersea cable systems sound like a thing of the past.

The reality is that the cloud is actually under the ocean. Even though they might seem behind the times, fibre-optic cables are actually state-of-the-art global communications technologies. Since they use light to encode information and remain unfettered by weather, cables carry data faster and cheaper than satellites. They crisscross the continents too — a message from New York to California also travels by fibr-optic cable. These systems are not going to be replaced by aerial communications anytime soon.

The biggest problem with cable systems is not technological — it’s human. Because they run underground, underwater and between telephone poles, cable systems populate the same spaces we do. As a result, we accidentally break them all the time. Local construction projects dig up terrestrial lines. Boaters drop anchors on cables. And submarines can pinpoint systems under the sea.

Most of the recent media coverage has been dominated by the question of vulnerability. Are global communications networks really at risk of disruption? What would happen if these cables were cut? Do we need to worry about the threat of sabotage from Russian subs or terrorist agents?

The answer to this is not black and white. Any individual cable is always at risk, but likely far more so from boaters and fishermen than any saboteur. Over history, the single largest cause of disruption has been people [unintentionally dropping anchors and nets](https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid=1&doctype=cite&docid=35+Tul.+Mar.+L.+J.+103&srctype=smi&srcid=3B15&key=643357ed57ae3d616915cb7b77c245f4). The [International Cable Protection Committee](https://www.iscpc.org) has been working for years to prevent such breaks.

As a result, cables today are covered in steel armour and buried beneath the seafloor at their shore-ends, where the human threat is most concentrated. This provides some level of protection. In the deep sea, the ocean’s inaccessibility largely safeguards cables — they need only to be covered with a thin polyethylene sheath. It’s not that it’s much more difficult to sever cables in the deep ocean, it’s just that the primary forms of interference are less likely to happen. The sea is so big and the cables are so narrow, the probability isn’t that high that you’d run across one.

Sabotage has actually been rare in the history of undersea cables. There are certainly occurrences (though none recently), but these are disproportionately publicised. The World War 1 [German raid of the Fanning Island cable station in the Pacific Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanning_Raid) gets a lot of attention. And there was [speculation about sabotage](http://www.economist.com/node/10653963) in the cable disruptions outside Alexandria, Egypt in 2008, which cut 70% of the country’s Internet, affecting millions. Yet we hear little about the regular faults that occur, on average, [about 200 times each year](https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid=1&doctype=cite&docid=35+Tul.+Mar.+L.+J.+103&srctype=smi&srcid=3B15&key=643357ed57ae3d616915cb7b77c245f4).

**Redundancy provides some protection**  
The fact is it’s incredibly difficult to monitor these lines. Cable companies have been trying to do so for more than a century, since the first telegraph lines were laid in the 1800s. But the ocean is too vast and the lines simply too long. It would be impossible to stop every vessel that came anywhere near critical communications cables. We’d need to create extremely long, “no-go” zones across the ocean, which itself would profoundly disrupt the economy.

[Fewer than 300 cable systems](http://submarinecablemap.com) transport almost all transoceanic traffic around the world. And these often run through narrow pressure points where small disruptions can have massive impacts. Since each cable can carry an extraordinary amount of information, it’s not uncommon for an entire country to rely on only a handful of systems. In many places, it would take only a few cable cuts to take out large swathes of the Internet. If the right cables were disrupted at the right time, it could disrupt global Internet traffic for weeks or even months.

The thing that protects global information traffic is the fact that there’s some redundancy built into the system. Since there is more cable capacity than there is traffic, when there is a break, information is automatically rerouted along other cables. Because there are many systems linking to the US, and a lot of Internet infrastructure is located here, a single cable outage is unlikely to cause any noticeable effect for Americans.

Any single cable line has been and will continue to be susceptible to disruption. And the only way around this is to build a more diverse system. But as things are, even though individual companies each look out for their own network, there is no economic incentive or supervisory body to ensure the global system as a whole is resilient. If there’s a vulnerability to worry about, this is it.

The apparent Russian focus on the cables, which provide Internet and other communications connections to North America and Europe, could give the Kremlin the power to sever or tap into vital data lines, the officials said. Russian submarine activity has increased to levels unseen since the Cold War, they said, sparking hunts in recent months for the elusive watercraft.

“We are now seeing Russian underwater activity in the vicinity of undersea cables that I don’t believe we have ever seen,” said U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Andrew Lennon, the commander of NATO’s submarine forces. “Russia is clearly taking an interest in NATO and NATO nations’ undersea infrastructure.”

NATO has responded with plans to reestablish a command post, shuttered after the Cold War, to help secure the North Atlantic. NATO allies are also rushing to boost anti-submarine warfare capabilities and to develop advanced submarine-detecting planes.

Britain’s top military commander also warned that Russia could imperil the cables that form the backbone of the modern global economy. The privately owned lines carry nearly all of the communications on the Internet, facilitating trillions of dollars of daily trade. If severed, they could snarl the Web. If tapped, they could give Russia a valuable picture of the tide of the world’s Internet traffic.

“It’s a pattern of activity, and it’s a vulnerability,” said British Air Chief Marshal Stuart Peach, in an interview.

The Russian Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment about the cables.

The Russian sea activity comes as the Kremlin has also pressed against NATO in the air and on land. Russian jets routinely clip NATO airspace in the Baltics, and troops drilled near NATO territory in September.

Russia has moved to modernize its once-decrepit Soviet-era fleet of submarines, bringing online or overhauling 13 craft since 2014. That pace, coming after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula set off a new era of confrontation with the West, has spurred NATO efforts to counter them. Russia has about 60 full-size submarines, while the United States has 66.

Among Russia’s capabilities, Lennon said, are deep-sea research vessels, including an old converted ballistic submarine that carries smaller submarines.

“They can do oceanographic research, underwater intelligence gathering,” he said. “And what we have observed is an increased activity of that in the vicinity of undersea cables. We know that these auxiliary submarines are designed to work on the ocean floor, and they’re transported by the mother ship, and we believe they may be equipped to manipulate objects on the ocean floor.”

That capability could give Russia the ability to sever the cables or tap into them. The insulated fiber-optic cables are fragile, and ships have damaged them accidentally by dragging their anchors along the seabed. That damage happens near the shore, where it is relatively easy to fix, not in the deeper Atlantic, where the cost of mischief could be far greater.

Lennon declined to say whether NATO believes Russia has actually touched the cables. Russian military leaders have acknowledged that the Kremlin is active undersea at levels not seen since the end of the Cold War.

“Last year we reached the same level as before the post-Soviet period, in terms of running hours,” said Adm. Vladimir Korolev, the commander of the Russian Navy, earlier this year. “This is more than 3,000 days at sea for the Russian submarine fleet. This is an excellent sign.”

The activity has forced a revival of Western sub-hunting skills that lay largely dormant since the end of the Cold War. Lennon said NATO allies have long practiced submarine-hunting. But until the last few years, there were few practical needs for close tracking, military officials said.

In recent months, the U.S. Navy has flown sorties in the areas where Russia is known to operate its submarines. NATO does not comment on specific submarine-tracking flights and declined to release data, citing the classified nature of the missions. But NATO officials say that their submarine-tracking activities have significantly increased in the region.

Submarines are particularly potent war-fighting craft because they can generally only be heard, not seen, underwater. They can serve as a retaliatory strike force in case of nuclear war, threaten military resupply efforts and expand the range of conventional firepower available for use in lower-level conflicts.

The vessels are a good fit for the Kremlin's strategy of making do with less than its rivals. Even as Russia remains a vastly weaker military force than NATO, the Kremlin has been able to pack an outsize punch in its confrontation with the West through the seizure of Crimea, support for the Syrian regime and, according to U.S. intelligence, its attempts to influence the U.S. election.

Russian military planners can say, “I can build fewer of them, I can have better quality, and I can put at risk and challenge and make it difficult for NATO,” the official said.

Still, some analysts say the threat to cables may be overblown.

“Arguably, the Russians wouldn’t be doing their jobs if they couldn’t threaten underwater cables. Certainly, NATO allies would not be doing theirs if they were unable to counter that,” said Adam Thomson, a former British ambassador to NATO.

NATO’s hunts — which have stretched across the Baltic, Mediterranean and Atlantic — have mobilized submarine-tracking frigates, sonar-equipped P8 Poseidon planes and helicopters, and attack submarines that have combed the seas.

“The Russians are operating all over the Atlantic,” said NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. “They are also operating closer to our shores.”

Russia’s enhanced submarine powers give urgency to NATO’s new efforts to ensure that it can get forces to the battlefront if there is a conflict. In addition to the new Atlantic-focused command, the alliance also plans to create another command dedicated to enabling military forces to travel quickly across Europe.

NATO defense ministers approved the creation of the commands at a November meeting. Further details are expected in February. The plans are still being negotiated, but they currently include the North Atlantic command being embedded inside the U.S. Fleet Forces Command in Norfolk, which would transform into a broader NATO joint force command if there was a conflict.

“Credible deterrence is linked to credible reinforcement capabilities,” Stoltenberg said. “We’re a transatlantic alliance. You need to be able to cross the Atlantic.”

But with an aging submarine fleet and growing threats from North Korea and elsewhere, the Navy risks overstretching its submarine fleet in the Atlantic and Pacific theaters.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is increasingly challenging U.S. security interests, and his submarine fleet’s “operational tempo is reaching Cold War-era levels,” said Magnus Nordenman, director of the Transatlantic Security Initiative at the Washington-based Atlantic Council. “Clearly, there is more attention being paid by the U.S. Navy in the Atlantic due to the Russian threat.”

The U.S. has 70 nuclear-powered submarines: 52 attack subs, four cruise-missile-armed subs and 14 ballistic missile subs. Fourteen are patrolling the world’s waterways.

Adm. John Richardson, chief of naval operations, acknowledged this month that the numbers represent an uptick in traditional submarine operations, but he declined to comment on what, specifically, warranted the shift.

But former U.S. defense officials and analysts say there is little question that it was driven by a desire by Defense Secretary James Mattis and his top aides to deliver a robust response to the increased Russian activity in the Atlantic.

According to GlobalFirePower.com, North Korea has the world’s largest submarine fleet by raw numbers with 76, though most of Pyongyang’s fleet consists of shorter-range, electric-diesel coastal patrol craft. China and Russia, both with modern nuclear-powered fleets that rival the U.S. fleet, have 68 subs and 63 subs, respectively.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, in an interview with the Frankfurt Allgemeine and other news outlets in December, said the Kremlin is investing heavily in its submarine fleet, with 13 delivered since 2013. NATO countries, he said, have let their underwater firepower lag. “We have practiced less and lost skills,” the NATO chief said.

A particular point of concern, said one former high-level U.S. Navy official, is that Moscow may be attempting to tap into or sever some of the 550,000 miles of underwater fiber-optic cables that span the Atlantic and Arctic sea lanes.

“Russians have had a capability … to do things with these cables for the last 20 to 30 years,” said Tom Callender, who once served as head of capabilities for the Navy’s deputy undersecretary office and is now a senior defense fellow at The Heritage Foundation.

“It is, in some ways, a strategic threat,” Mr. Callender said in an interview. The threat becomes more potent as the military and civilian worlds come to rely so heavily on online information and communication.

More than 95 percent of the global internet traffic — military and civilian, classified and unclassified — is transmitted across the network of submerged cables along the ocean floor, according to Washington-based tech firm TeleGeography. The quantity is massive compared with just a decade ago, when just 1 percent of all online traffic went through the cables.

The majority of the 285 underwater cables in place crisscross beneath heavily trafficked sea lanes of the Atlantic and Arctic regions. According to TeleGeography, the longest single cable stretches 24,000 miles and relays internet traffic and other electronic communications from Europe, Asia and Africa.

The scale and scope of global communications moving through the network of cables — some of which are only 2 inches thick — present a lucrative target that is vulnerable to attack by U.S. adversaries. It also poses a significant challenge to U.S. forces defending the lines.

“If a nation desired to do something [to the cables], that would have a significant impact,” said Mr. Callender. Simply “having that capability is something we always must be aware of.”

Mr. Nordenman said protecting those cables has been a priority for U.S. defense officials for decades but that the mission has fallen somewhat by the wayside while the Pentagon focuses on wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, counterterrorism operations in the Middle East, and the rise of China and the battle for influence in the South China Sea.

Senior Navy planners “are once again getting used to operating in the Atlantic, which has not been a priority” to the Pentagon in the post-9/11 era, Mr. Nordenman said.

“The Navy is going to have to play a delicate balancing game” if the U.S. submarine fleet is to meet the rising Russian challenge in the Atlantic alongside all the other operational demands placed on the Navy, he said.

It is the growing competition in the Atlantic and the Arctic Circle, focusing particularly on the submerged communication lines, where Russia is outpacing the U.S., said Mr. Nordenman. “In any age of warfare, intercepting and disrupting communications has always been a part of warfare,” he said.

NATO’s Mr. Stoltenberg warns that the trans-Atlantic cable links and sea lanes are particularly vital for an alliance that links the Old World and the New World.

“We are a trans-Atlantic alliance, and we must be able to transport troops and equipment across the Atlantic. We need safe and open sea routes for that.”

With the U.S. strategic interests elsewhere, Russian navy leaders have focused a significant portion of their buildup on submarine surveillance operations. The most notable effort was the development of the classified AS-12 “Losharik” spy submarine. In development since 1998, the sub did not enter service with the Russian navy until 2003.

Little is known about the surveillance capabilities of the Losharik, which Moscow has characterized as a research and rescue vessel. However, analysts say the vessel’s true role is to conduct reconnaissance missions in support of Russian special operations, given the sub’s ability to dive much deeper than more conventional attack submarines. NATO officials have code-named the sub NORSUB-5.

Aside from the Losharik, Russian naval officials are configuring two ballistic missile submarines into surveillance vessels, as well as an Oscar-class cruise missile submarine for similar missions, Mr. Nordenman said in an analysis of Russian navy capabilities.

The U.S. Navy, on the other hand, has not been as aggressive in expanding its submarine fleet to address the Russian moves, said Mr. Callender, who also has served as a Navy submarine officer. Investments in the American underwater fleet “fell off in the 1990s,” he said. “There has been a refocus on getting them back out to sea,” as evidenced by the higher operational tempo within the U.S. fleet.

Navy leaders are looking to expand the underwater fleet in the budget for the 2019 fiscal year, which starts in October. President Trump’s budget proposal released Monday includes a Pentagon request for one new Columbia-class nuclear attack submarine as part of its $194 billion total.

The Navy wants to buy two of the newest version of the Virginia-class fast attack submarines, according to the service’s proposal. It remains unclear how much of the Navy’s submarine procurements will be designated for surveillance operations, Mr. Nordenman said.

“The Navy is quite silent on this,” he said, noting that submarine reconnaissance missions “are some of the most highly classified operations that the U.S. does.”

One of the relatively few known submarines to carry out such missions is the USS Jimmy Carter, a Seawolf-class submarine modified with the “multimission platform.” The modification implanted a special section on the vessel that can launch minisubmarines used by Navy SEALs or small underwater drones. The USS Carter, based out of Bangor, Washington, reportedly conducts many of the underwater surveillance missions in the Atlantic and Arctic Circle.

Despite the underwater arms race between Russia and the U.S., the answer to securing the sea floor in the Atlantic may not lie in the size of either country’s submarine fleet, Mr. Nordenman said.

“I do not think there is a direct counter or a special sub-versus-special sub scenario” that will define who controls the depths of the Atlantic or Arctic, he said. The key for the Pentagon, he said, is to maintain a persistent presence on and below the ocean waters.

Continued submarine patrols combined with aerial surveillance of Russian movements — similar to the “freedom of operation” patrols used to challenge Beijing’s territorial claims in the South China Sea — will be vital to containing the threat, Mr. Nordenman said. “The more you know about [the adversary],” he said, “the better you can react.","The article discusses the vulnerabilities of underwater fiber-optic cables due to Russian submarine activities, highlighting the risk of these cables being tapped or severed.

"The Law of Maritime Neutrality and Submarine Cables","Explores legal rights of neutral states regarding submarine cables, detailing potential degradation or severing by belligerents during conflicts.","https://www.ejiltalk.org/the-law-of-maritime-neutrality-and-submarine-cables","2020-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","Written by James Kraska",Yes,"James Kraska","New York City, New York, United States",-,"2020-07-29","English","European Journal of International Law","In an era of great power competition in which states seek to avoid “taking sides,” the international law of neutrality deserves greater attention. Information technology is the contemporary currency of power and the global network of over 420 submarine cables spanning some 700,000 miles is the information superhighway used for sharing 97 percent of international communications. During armed conflict, belligerents could degrade, damage, or sever submarine cables, or use them to launch cyberattacks against their enemy. These activities invariably will affect the economic and military communications of neutral states. To what extent may belligerent states damage, destroy, or use submarine cables owned or operated by neutral states to prosecute the war effort? This question lies at the intersection of three areas of law: the peacetime law of the sea, the law governing submarine cables, and the law of naval warfare, including the law of maritime neutrality. There are few restrictions on using or destroying neutral submarine cables in the law of naval warfare, which is lex specialis, and prevails as against the other two bodies of law during armed conflict. Belligerents may lawfully use the entire global network of submarine cables as a domain of virtual warfare without any material restraint from the law of neutrality. We may expect that belligerents will use, and even intentionally damage or cut neutral submarine cables.

This article first explores the peacetime law governing submarine cables. All states have the right to lay submarine cables on the high seas, as well as in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and continental shelves of coastal states. Next, the article focuses on the traditional maritime law of neutrality. This body of law applies during armed conflict and protects the rights of neutral states not party to the conflict, including the inviolability of submarine cables in their waters from physical attack by belligerents. This right, however, neither protects neutral cables lying outside neutral territorial waters from destruction by belligerents, nor prevents belligerents from using neutral cable infrastructure for cyberattacks against another belligerent. The automatic routing of cable traffic in today’s global submarine cable systems means that belligerents are unable to avoid neutral cables. At the same time, neutral states are absolved of their traditional obligation under the law of neutrality to ensure that their cables are not (mis)used by a belligerent. This article concludes that the technology of the global cable system, and customary law reflected in state practice, suggest that belligerent states would use or even destroy neutral submarine cables during armed conflict.

**Law Governing Submarine Cables**
Submarine cables wind through the seabed of the oceans and connect to landing stations on the beach. In peacetime, this infrastructure is protected from accidental or purposeful damage or destruction by the 1884 Convention for the Protection of Submarine Cables. The treaty states in article 15, however, that it does not limit belligerent rights during armed conflict. The operation of submarine cables in peacetime is also regulated by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). States may lay cables in the EEZ and on the continental shelves of coastal states in accordance with articles 58(1) and 79, subject to the duty to exercise “due regard” for the resource rights of the host coastal states, as set forth in article 56. In these areas coastal states may adopt “reasonable measures” concerning foreign cables to protect its right to develop seabed mineral resources or to protect the marine environment, under article 79(2). States also may lay cables on the deep seabed beyond national jurisdiction under articles 87(1)(c) and 112. During armed conflict, however, the lex specialis regime of the law of naval warfare suspends UNCLOS among the belligerents and it modifies the relationship between belligerent states and neutral states.

**The Law of Maritime Neutrality**
Neutral states are those that have elected not to take part in an armed conflict and instead seek to maintain friendly, impartial relations with all states. The law of neutrality regulates the relationship between states that are party to a conflict and those that are not engaged in armed conflict. Neutral states strive to balance two conflicting interests: the right of belligerents to prosecute the war effort by isolating the enemy and destroying opposing armed forces, and the right of neutral states to be free from the adverse effects of armed conflicts to which they are not a party. As President Thomas Jefferson decreed in 1793 as French warships sought refuge in American ports during the war between revolutionary France and the first coalition, “the law of nations and the rules of neutrality forbid” taking sides.

The law of neutrality largely has focused on the right of neutral states on the high seas to engage in trade with one another, and separately, with belligerent states (except for contraband), as set out in the British Declaration on Neutrals and Letters of Marque of 28 March 1854 and the 1856 Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law. These provisions were further codified in article 6 of the U.S.-U.K. 1871 Washington Treaty. Neutral states have the right to engage in commerce, protected from the worst effects of armed conflict to which they are not a party.

Neutral territory is inviolable by belligerents under article 1 of the 1907 Hague Convention V. At sea, neutral space extends to the waters under the sovereignty of coastal states, including ports, internal waters, and the territorial sea of a state in accordance with articles 2 and 5 of Hague Convention XIII. Similarly, article 3 of the 1928 Convention on Maritime Neutrality requires that belligerents shall “refrain from acts of war” in neutral waters. This rule extends logically to archipelagic waters under Part IV of UNCLOS, as recognised in Part II, rules 23 to 30, of the San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflict at Sea and para. 1.1 of the Helsinki Principles on the Law of Maritime Neutrality. Belligerent warships and auxiliaries may enter neutral territorial seas for mere transit but may not conduct operations in excess of simple innocent passage, archipelagic sea lanes passage, or transit passage through straits, as appropriate.

Belligerent states are forbidden from using neutral waters as a base of naval operations against the enemy. This proscription includes using neutral waters to refuel, resupply, repair, or rearm warships (beyond what is minimally required to get underway) in accordance with article 6 of Hague XIII, and belligerent warships may not remain in neutral waters longer than twenty-four hours under article 12, as well as article 5 of the 1928 Inter-American Convention on Maritime Neutrality.

Article 5 of Hague XIII prohibits belligerents from erecting on neutral territory “wireless telegraphy stations or any apparatus” used in military communications with “belligerent forces on land or sea.” This rule is amplified in article 4 of the Inter-American Convention: belligerents may not install in neutral waters “radio-telegraph stations or any other apparatus” to communicate with military forces, or to “make use” of such installations established before the war and “which have not been opened to the public.” These rules on the neutral inviolability of the physical domain of waters under coastal state sovereignty also apply to submarine cables physically present in those areas. The law of neutrality has always been complex – even unsettled – and submarine cables makes analysis even more challenging.

**“Necessities of War”**
Submarine cables that lie on the continental shelf in the internal waters, archipelagic waters, or territorial sea of a coastal state are under the sovereignty of the coastal state and are physically inviolable during armed conflict. During the Spanish-American war, the United States set the precedent for the belligerent right to cut neutral cables serving the enemy that lie outside neutral waters. On 1 May 1898, Commodore Dewey entered Manila Bay and destroyed or captured the Spanish fleet. The following day, he cut the Manila-Hong Kong cable owned by a British company and laid down under Spanish control.","The article 'The Law of Maritime Neutrality and Submarine Cables' discusses submarine cables extensively, including their potential damage or severing during armed conflicts.

It states, 'belligerents could degrade, damage, or sever submarine cables,' highlighting the implications of such actions on international communications.

The article treats these issues as central themes, exploring the legal rights of neutral states and the actions of belligerents, which aligns well with the criterion of discussing cut sea cables."

Wires inside tubes no bigger than a garden hose.**  
By Christopher IntagliataMarlisse Silver Sweeney  
Published Date: 04/17/2015  

With cell phone, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth almost everywhere, it sometimes seems like we’ve finally ditched the cumbersome cords that are tethering us and our gadgets to Earth. But in reality, we live in a world that’s more wired than ever before — it's just that those wires are strung along the bottom of the world’s oceans.

“Ninety-nine percent of trans-oceanic data traffic, Internet traffic, goes underneath the ocean on the very bottom of the sea floor,” says Nicole Starosielski, an assistant professor of media, culture and communication at New York University. She’s the author of ""The Undersea Network,"" a book exploring this hidden world of cable.

The scale of the network is both superhuman and surprisingly mundane at the same time. The wires are strung along the ocean bed by large tankers, which carry enough cable to go across the entire Atlantic Ocean. But the cables themselves aren't that big.

“It’s about the size of a garden hose,” Starosielski says. “In Guam, for example, the cables run right over the shoreline. … People step over them looking for the tourist attraction down the beach … [and] have no idea the Internet is pulsing right underneath their feet.”

And that's why the biggest threat to these cables is humans, not sharks or other sea life. “The majority of the disruptions of our undersea network come from people dropping an anchor off their boat and hitting the cable, or a fisherman dragging a net on the bottom of the sea floor,” Starosielski explains — not exactly the usual cause that comes to mind when Google fails to reload.

The cables seemingly haven’t been targets for terrorists thus far. “Some in the industry speculate that is because they’re not a visible target,” says Starosielski, but it also could be due to a lack of reporting. She notes one incident off the coast of Egypt in 2008 when multiple cables broke in succession.

“This looked very suspicious,” she says. Though reports indicated the damage was due to ships dropping anchors in the area, videos didn’t show any vessels in the area at the right time. The resulting outage was huge, disconnecting approximately 60 million people in India, 12 million in Pakistan, six million in Egypt and almost five million in Saudi Arabia.

“There are certainly people who are worrying about the fact that our cable network isn’t totally diverse, and there are these critical single points of failure,” Starosielski says.

The Arctic Fibre Project, which is exploring laying fiber-optic cables in the Arctic Ocean, would help combat the lack of diversity. “We’ve never had a cable that has gone through the Arctic Ocean,"" Starosielski says. The cables would link Japan to the United Kingdom could zap data from one end to the other in just 154 milliseconds.

But terrorism or human error aside, the cables were built to last. They can withstand the inhospitable ocean floor for 25 years, and, as Starosielski notes, “what else of the Internet has been instituted and stayed the same for 25 years?""  

_This story is based on an interview from PRI's Science Friday with Ira Flatow._","The article titled ""What links the global Internet? Wires inside tubes no bigger than a garden hose"" discusses the critical role of undersea cables in global internet connectivity.

It mentions that the majority of disruptions to these cables are caused by human activities, rather than natural events.

A specific incident from 2008 is highlighted, where multiple cables off the coast of Egypt were damaged, resulting in significant internet outages for millions of people.

This incident illustrates the implications of cut sea cables on global communications.

Given that the article treats the topic of undersea cables, including disruptions and their impacts, as a central theme, it fulfills the criterion of being about cut sea cables."

It's sometimes easy to forget (if, in fact, you ever knew) that the information superhighway travels mostly in huge cables buried deep at sea—miles and miles of fiber optic wire that carry on them 95% of our daily communication and $10 trillion (!) worth of global business. If someone were to sever enough of said cables, our tenuous grasp on the modern world would be lost. Electronic banking would be a distant memory, your smartphone would be just a phone, and door-to-door encyclopedia salesmen would descend upon suburban neighborhoods again. In short, life would be hell.

These usually distant fears have been stoked recently by Russian naval activities. According to a story in the New York Times on Sunday, Russian spy planes and submarines are ""aggressively operating near the vital undersea cables that carry almost all global Internet communications."" American intelligence officials are reportedly worried that this activity could mean the Ruskies are scouting vulnerabilities and thinking of cutting the cables sometime in the future.

Feeding the fear, of course, is the fact that our relationship with Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, has never been more frayed. With military plays in Crimea, Eastern Ukraine, and Syria, he's thumbed his nose at the U.N., and tensions between the US and Russia are at dangerously high levels not seen since the Cold War—something Putin's cagey meeting with Obama late last month illustrated.

So, how likely is it that Russia would cut these cables, and what would it look like if they did? For that answer we asked Nicole Starosielski, Assistant professor of media, culture, and communication at New York University, and author of the book The Undersea Network, which is accompanied by an interactive digital mapping project, where readers can trace cable routes, view photographs and archival materials, and read stories about the island cable hubs. She made us feel a bit better.

**VICE: Russian submarines and spy ships are, according to the New York Times, ""aggressively operating"" near vital undersea cables that carry almost all global internet communications. There's a growing fear the Russians will cut these cables in some of their hardest-to-access locations. On a scale of one to ten, how totally petrified should we all be about this?**  
**Nicole Starosielski:** I don't think we should be totally petrified about this. Or, at least, we should be much more scared of other things before we worry about a Russian threat to US internet traffic. By and large, our network is concentrated along a set of narrow cable routes, which are regularly disrupted by everything from natural disasters to fishermen's anchors. These take out more cables than deliberate cable cutting ever has.

**What would it take to cut cables in these ""hardest-to-access"" locations? Something tells me we're not just talking a couple divers and a pair of bolt cutters.**  
It wouldn't take much to cut cables in the deep sea. They can be severed just as easily, and using the same means, as shallow water cables. They can be cut with an anchor, a grapnel, or any large, sharp device dragged along the seafloor. It would actually be easier than sending divers down with bolt cutters.

**Walk us through what happens if, say, tomorrow we wake up and these vital cables have been severed. Will the internet disappear? Will we have to engage with strangers instead of staring into our smartphones?**  
This really depends on how many cables are cut, and where they are routed. Cable breaks are actually fairly routine—on average once every three days. But in most cases, traffic can be redirected. When the 2011 tsunami severed a number of the undersea cables in Japan, the country remained online, in part because of its massive number of international connections. In other cases, such as in nations that only have a few cables, a single break could be disastrous. There are a number of occasions when the internet has disappeared after a set of cable cuts. The 2006 Hengchun earthquake severed a number of cables near Taiwan—a pressure point in the global system—and made the internet inaccessible for many, disrupted financial transactions, and brought down other critical systems. In the United States, however, you'd have to cut quite a few cables before anyone would have to start engaging with strangers.

**In the Times story it says these cables carry ""global business worth more than $10 trillion a day, including from financial institutions that settle transactions on them every second."" What does the cutting of these cables mean to us in a financial sense? Should we all be hoarding our money under our mattresses? Will our ATM cards stop working?**  
Stephen Malphrus, staff director at the US Federal Reserve Board, has said if the cable networks are disrupted, ""the financial services sector does not 'grind to a halt,' rather it snaps to a halt."" If the undersea cable network stopped operating, it would not only disrupt connections between major financial institutions, but would affect many of our everyday financial transactions. ATM cards included. Online banking would be out of the question. But again, these cuts already happen on a regular basis, and are disproportionately felt in regions with fewer cables.

**Beyond spy planes, in what ways does the US monitor the kind of activity we're talking about near these cables?**  
By and large, cables aren't monitored. They stretch thousands of miles across the ocean, and it's simply too much work to monitor them all. Cable companies have been trying to monitor their lines for over a century, using all kinds of tactics: helicopters, patrol boats, and so on. But that hasn't prevented them from being broken time and time again by fishermen and boaters in the coastal seas

**If the Russians did this, wouldn't it disrupt their own internet communications, too? What would be the upside in this for them?**  
Yes, this is certainly a problem. A worker in the industry once told me that contemporary cable cutting would be kind of like standing out on a tree limb and then sawing it off—you'd disrupt your own networks at the same time. If a Russian submarine were to cut a number of cables linking to the United States, this wouldn't just affect the United States. It would affect all of the countries that use these links to get somewhere else, and all of the countries linking to the United States. We're a huge node in the global communications system, so the effects would extend far beyond our national boundaries. If any country, Russia or otherwise, simply hoped to cause widespread disruption for anyone using digital media, then this might be an effective technique. But it's an indiscriminate one.

**Doesn't it seem kind of old fashioned that the entire infrastructure for our data is run through big-ass underwater cables?**  
Well it is quite old fashioned—undersea cables are one of the oldest global communications technologies. Even though the lines have been updated from copper telegraph wires to high-speed fiber optics, they're still being laid much like they were 150 years ago. And they often run along the same routes. But they're the most effective and efficient way to communicate today. Cables carry data traffic at faster speeds and lower cost than satellites, and it's unlikely that we're going to move on from them anytime soon.

**Why aren't the locations of the cables more closely guarded or kept classified?**  
The most significant human threat to cable systems has never been intentional sabotage. This has been an anomaly in the history of cable disruptions. The biggest threats are from boats that unintentionally drop anchors or nets on cable systems. Some cable companies allocate hundreds of thousands of dollars annually just to repair these disruptions, which they assume will happen. The best protection against this threat is the publication of cable routes, so that way fishermen and other boaters won't accidentally break them. Military cable routes, on the other hand, are kept classified.

Jens Stoltenberg, secretary-general of the military alliance, told German Sunday newspaper _Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung_ that an additional 13 subs had been added to Moscow's fleet since 2014.

""Russia has massively invested in its marine capability, especially in submarines,"" he said. ""Russia's submarine activity is now at its highest level since the Cold War.""

He said that Moscow's fleet was now operating ""closer to our shores,"" as well as across the Atlantic.

The alliance's top submarine commander, Rear Adm. Andrew Lennon, reiterated Stoltenberg's comments.

""Russian submarine activity is higher now in the last three years than it has been since the Cold War,"" Lennon said, according to [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/366326-nato-official-russian-submarine-activity-highest-since-the-cold-war).

""What we have observed over the past three years are more deployments annually of Russian submarines away from their local waters than we have observed in the prior decade.""

Russia has used its submarine fleet to roam around North Atlantic seas close to rival countries' shorelines for years. It has also heightened tensions with NATO on land and air, flying close to the alliance's jets and hosting military exercises in close proximity to NATO territory.

There are fears that Russia could use its greater presence in the waters near NATO territory to impact underwater communication lines that provide internet and telecommunications for both Europe and North America. Russia could either damage the lines, or even tap into them, gathering intelligence.

""We are now seeing Russian underwater activity in the vicinity of undersea cables that I don't believe we have ever seen,"" Lennon told the Washington Post on Friday. ""Russia is clearly taking an interest in NATO and NATO nations' undersea infrastructure.""

Those cables, if affected, could impact trillions of dollars worth of global trade, or, if breached, could provide Moscow with an intelligence picture of the entire internet.

Lennon believes that Russia's deep-sea research submarines could have the capabilities to take action on the Atlantic seabed, where the cables are located.

""They can do oceanographic research, underwater intelligence gathering,"" he said.

""And what we have observed is an increased activity of that in the vicinity of undersea cables. We know that these auxiliary submarines are designed to work on the ocean floor, and they're transported by the mother ship, and we believe they may be equipped to manipulate objects on the ocean floor.""","The article discusses the increase in Russian submarine activity and its implications for undersea cables, including direct mentions of 'undersea cables' and concerns about their security.

It states that Russia's submarine presence could impact these cables, which are critical for global trade and internet connectivity.

But in reality, we live in a world that’s more wired than ever before — it's just that those wires are strung along the bottom of the world’s oceans.

“Ninety-nine percent of trans-oceanic data traffic, Internet traffic, goes underneath the ocean on the very bottom of the sea floor,” says Nicole Starosielski, an assistant professor of media, culture and communication at New York University. She’s the author of ""The Undersea Network,"" a book exploring this hidden world of cable.

The scale of the network is both superhuman and surprisingly mundane at the same time. The wires are strung along the ocean bed by large tankers, which carry enough cable to go across the entire Atlantic Ocean. But the cables themselves aren't that big.

“It’s about the size of a garden hose,” Starosielski says. “In Guam, for example, the cables run right over the shoreline. ... People step over them looking for the tourist attraction down the beach ... [and] have no idea the Internet is pulsing right underneath their feet.”

And that's why the biggest threat to these cables is humans, not sharks or other sea life. “The majority of the disruptions of our undersea network come from people dropping an anchor off their boat and hitting the cable, or a fisherman dragging a net on the bottom of the sea floor,” Starosielski explains — not exactly the usual cause that comes to mind when Google fails to reload.

The cables seemingly haven’t been targets for terrorists thus far. “Some in the industry speculate that is because they’re not a visible target,” says Starosielski, but it also could be due to a lack of reporting. She notes one incident off the coast of Egypt in 2008 when multiple cables broke in succession.

“This looked very suspicious,” she says. Though reports indicated the damage was due to ships dropping anchors in the area, videos didn’t show any vessels in the area at the right time. The resulting outage was huge, disconnecting approximately 60 million people in India, 12 million in Pakistan, six million in Egypt and almost five million in Saudi Arabia.

“There are certainly people who are worrying about the fact that our cable network isn’t totally diverse, and there are these critical single points of failure,” Starosielski says.

The Arctic Fibre Project, which is exploring laying fiber-optic cables in the Arctic Ocean, would help combat the lack of diversity. “We’ve never had a cable that has gone through the Arctic Ocean,"" Starosielski says. The cables would link Japan to the United Kingdom could zap data from one end to the other in just 154 milliseconds.

But terrorism or human error aside, the cables were built to last. They can withstand the inhospitable ocean floor for 25 years, and, as Starosielski notes, “what else of the Internet has been instituted and stayed the same for 25 years?","The article discusses the extensive network of undersea cables that carry the majority of global internet traffic.

Undersea fiber-optic cables are critical infrastructures that support our global network society. They transport 99 percent of all transoceanic digital communications, including phone calls, text and e-mail messages, websites, digital images and video, and even some television (cumulatively, over thirty trillion bits per second as of 2010). It is submarine systems, rather than satellites, that carry most of the Internet across the oceans. Cables drive international business: they facilitate the expansion of multinational corporations, enable the outsourcing of operations, and transmit the high-speed financial transactions that connect the world’s economies. Stephen Malphrus, staff director at the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, has stated that if the cable networks are disrupted, “the financial services sector does not ‘grind to a halt,’ rather it snaps to a halt.”

As a result, the reliability of undersea cables has been deemed “absolutely essential” for the functioning of governments and the enforcement of national security. Militaries use the cables to manage long-range weapons tests and remote battlefield operations. Undersea networks also make possible new distributions of transnational media that depend on high-capacity digital exchange, from the collaborations of production companies in the United States and New Zealand on the 2009 film _Avatar_ to the global coordination of _World of Warcraft_ players. At the same time, cable infrastructure enables modes of resistance that challenge dominant media formations. Messages produced by the Arab Spring and Occupy movements traveled between countries on undersea cables. If the world’s 223 international undersea cable systems were to suddenly disappear, only a minuscule amount of this traffic would be backed up by satellite, and the Internet would effectively be split between continents.

Packet-switching technology, which forms the basis for the Internet’s distributive operations, is often understood in terms of its potential to survive an attack: if several nodes in a network are disrupted, the system’s routing can in theory move traffic around them. The relative centralization of the cable system and its embeddedness in existing territorialities make the physical networks across which these packets move far less resilient than we imagine. In 2006 an earthquake near Taiwan set off an undersea landslide and snapped several cables. Another significant outage happened in Vietnam in 2007, when cable thieves pulled up several of the country’s working lines. In 2011 a woman in Georgia shut down much of the Internet in Armenia when she dug up two fiber-optic lines while looking for scrap metal. Although network carriers are often able to reroute traffic, in many cases, breaks have decreased Internet connectivity. Repairing undersea networks is dependent on a limited number of specialized cable ships, and in some places, including China, Italy, and Indonesia, companies have had to wait to receive permits before they can fix their systems.

Although the Internet is often imagined as a clean and durable technology, something that will eventually be extended everywhere at little cost, this vision fails to register the extensive financial, social, and environmental investments required to establish new systems and maintain existing ones. Taking this into consideration, we might think about the Internet not as a renewable resource but as a precarious platform, especially as moving our data to the cloud often entails increased dependence on undersea links. On one hand, this might help us make better choices about our own media consumption and content production, taking into account the potential precariousness of infrastructural systems. On the other hand, it might motivate us to push for a more genuinely distributed, resilient, and equitable network.

Sir Stuart Peach: Russia poses a ""new risk"" to economy and ways of living  

The UK's most senior military officer has warned of a new threat posed by Russia to communications and internet cables that run under the sea.  

Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, the chief of the defence staff, said Britain and Nato needed to prioritise protecting the lines of communication.  

He said it would ""immediately and potentially catastrophically"" hit the economy if they were cut or disrupted.  

The cables criss-cross the seabed, connecting up countries and continents.  

The world's submarine network comprises an estimated 213 independent cable systems and 545,018 miles (877,121 km) of fibre, according to a recent report for the Policy Exchange think tank.  

But it said a lack of formal state ownership meant cables do not have strong protection in international law.  

Despite that, an estimated 97% of global communications and $10 trillion in daily financial transactions are transmitted by cables under the ocean.  

Speaking to the Royal United Services Institute defence think tank, Sir Stuart said the vulnerability of undersea lines posed a ""new risk to our way of life"".  

He said Nato had prioritised the protection of the cables ""in response to the threat posed by the modernisation of the Russian navy, both nuclear and conventional submarines and ships"".  

Fears of Russia cutting, disrupting or ""wire tapping"" undersea communication lines are growing.  

Defence and intelligence chiefs see not just increased Russian submarine activity, but its willingness to use unconventional asymmetric warfare.  

In highlighting this threat, Air Chief Marshall Peach was admitting Britain and its Nato allies were ill-prepared to deal with the prospect of such an attack.  

Sir Stuart said: ""There is a new risk to our way of life, which is the vulnerability of the cables that criss-cross the seabeds.  

According to the Policy Exchange report, many cable systems are potentially at risk.  

""Undersea cables are the indispensable infrastructure of our time, essential to our modern life and digital economy, yet they are inadequately protected and highly vulnerable to attack at sea and on land, from both hostile states and terrorists,"" the report concluded.  

Conservative MP Rishi Sunak warned a successful attack on the UK's network of undersea communications cables could deal a ""crippling blow"" to the country's security and economy.  

Writing a foreword to the document, Admiral James Stavridis, a former US Navy officer and ex-Nato supreme allied commander, said: ""It is not satellites in the sky, but pipes on the ocean floor that form the backbone of the world's economy.""  

He also warned of a potential threat from China and Iran, as well as Russia.

Russian submarines have dramatically stepped up activity around undersea data cables in the North Atlantic, part of a more aggressive naval posture that has driven NATO to revive a Cold War-era command, according to senior military officials.

The apparent Russian focus on the cables, which provide internet and other communications connections to North America and Europe, could give the Kremlin the power to sever or tap into vital data lines. Russian submarine activity has increased to levels unseen since the Cold War, they said, sparking hunts in recent months for the elusive watercraft.

""We are now seeing Russian underwater activity in the vicinity of undersea cables that I don't believe we have ever seen,"" said US Navy Admiral Andrew Lennon, the commander of NATO's submarine forces. ""Russia is clearly taking an interest in NATO and NATO nations' undersea infrastructure.""

NATO has responded with plans to re-establish a command post, shuttered after the Cold War, to help secure the North Atlantic. NATO allies are also rushing to boost anti-submarine warfare capabilities and to develop advanced submarine-detecting planes.

Britain's top military commander also warned that Russia could imperil the cables that form the backbone of the modern global economy. The privately owned lines, laid along some of the same corridors as the first transatlantic telegraph wire in 1858, carry nearly all of the communications on the internet, facilitating trillions of dollars of daily trade. If severed, they could snarl the Web. If tapped, they could give Russia a valuable picture of the tide of the world's internet traffic.

""It's a pattern of activity, and it's a vulnerability,"" said British Air Chief Marshal Stuart Peach, in an interview.

The Russian Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment about the cables.

The Russian sea activity comes as the Kremlin has also pressed against NATO in the air and on land. Russian jets routinely clip NATO airspace in the Baltics, and troops drilled near NATO territory in September.

World news in pictures

Russia has moved to modernise its once-decrepit Soviet-era fleet of submarines, bringing online or overhauling 13 craft since 2014. That pace, coming after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula set off a new era of confrontation with the West, has spurred NATO efforts to counter them. Russia has about 60 full-size submarines, while the United States has 66.

Among Russia's capabilities, Lennon said, are deep-sea research vessels, including an old converted ballistic submarine that carries smaller submarines.

Lennon declined to say whether NATO believes Russia has actually touched the cables. Russian military leaders have acknowledged that the Kremlin is active undersea at levels not seen since the end of the Cold War, when Russia was forced to curtail its submarine program in the face of economic turmoil and disorganisation.

NATO allies have long practised submarine-hunting. But until the last few years, there were few practical needs for close tracking, military officials said.

In recent months, the US Navy has flown sorties in the areas where Russia is known to operate its submarines. NATO does not comment on specific submarine-tracking flights and declined to release data, citing the classified nature of the missions. But NATO officials say that their submarine-tracking activities have significantly increased in the region.

Submarines are particularly potent war-fighting craft because they can generally only be heard, not seen, underwater. They can serve as a retaliatory strike force in case of nuclear war, threaten military resupply efforts and expand the range of conventional firepower available for use in lower-level conflicts.

Russian military planners can say, ""I can build fewer of them, I can have better quality, and I can put at risk and challenge and make it difficult for NATO,"" the official said.

Still, some analysts say the threat to cables may be overblown. ""Arguably, the Russians wouldn't be doing their jobs if they couldn't threaten underwater cables. Certainly, NATO allies would not be doing theirs if they were unable to counter that,"" said Adam Thomson, a former British ambassador to NATO.

NATO's hunts - which have stretched across the Baltic, Mediterranean and Atlantic - have mobilised submarine-tracking frigates, sonar-equipped P8 Poseidon planes and helicopters, and attack submarines that have combed the seas.

NATO's new efforts to ensure that it can get forces to the battlefront if there is a conflict, Stoltenberg said. In addition to the new Atlantic-focused command, the alliance also plans to create another command dedicated to enabling military forces to travel quickly across Europe.

NATO defence ministers approved the creation of the commands at a November meeting. Further details are expected.","The article discusses the increasing activity of Russian submarines around undersea cables, highlighting the potential for these cables to be severed or disrupted, which aligns with the topic of cut sea cables.

One of the U.S. economy’s most critical resources is the massive network of undersea cables that transverse the globe, carrying the overwhelming majority of all internet traffic. Over 400 fiber optic cables carry 99% of transoceanic data, providing the physical links that bind our digital world together. This global infrastructure rests almost entirely in the hands of private companies.

In the modern geopolitical environment, the vulnerability of undersea communications cables stands out as an acute cyber security concern. Relatively little attention, however, has focused on the legal frameworks that govern the networks of glass and steel that form the literal backbone of our internet. This post lays out the threats to communications cables and the existing international laws protecting cables from intentional damage.

**Threats to Undersea Cables**

_Physical Attack_

Physical damage is the most direct threat to undersea cables. Such damage is usually accidental—often the cause is fishing ship nets and anchors. But history is rife with examples of navies intentionally attacking cables. At the outbreak of World War I, Britain severed all but one of Germany’s undersea telegraph lines. The British tapped the remaining cable, which allowed them to intercept communications (including those with important geopolitical consequences, such as the Zimmerman telegram that helped push the U.S. into the war). The Germans, lacking a fleet of cable ships of their own, attacked British telegraph cable landing sites in the Pacific Ocean. This case illustrates three cable vulnerabilities that still exist today: direct cutting, tapping and targeting landing sites.

States have long recognized that cables are vital to secure communication. In 1959, a Soviet trawler cut five cables off the coast of Newfoundland, prompting the U.S. to send a radar ship to board the trawler under the provisions of the 1884 Submarine Cable Convention. (The 1884 treaty prohibits intentional damage to cables and allows navies to board vessels to investigate reports of damage.) The incident was followed by a diplomatic exchange of notes in which the United States said: “The protection of submarine telecommunications cables on the high seas constitutes an international obligation.”

More recently, Bangladeshi authorities determined that an intentional cable outage in 2007 cost Bangladesh’s telecommunication company over $1 million. In 2013, Egyptian authorities discovered three scuba divers attempting to cut a cable off the port of Alexandria. The cable industry estimates that over 150 faults in cable connectivity occur every year, but because the vast majority are isolated incidents, network redundancy limits their effects. It is far more problematic to lose all cables in a specific area: An 2006 earthquake off the coast of Taiwan struck a concentration of cables in the nearby ocean and disrupted internet traffic across Asia, causing months of slow connectivity.

Recognizing the grave possible consequences, the United States takes threats to cables seriously. In 2015, Russian ships and submarines near cable routes around the world caused concern within the U.S. intelligence community that Russia was attempting to tap or cut critical internet communications lines. A Cold War-style drama played out between the Russian subs following cable lines and the American ships, subs and spy satellites tracking them. These incidents highlighted the danger of cutting cables in deep water, where repairing them could take weeks or months.

_Network Attack_

Today, in addition to physical threats, submarine cable systems face significant virtual vulnerabilities. The consortiums of companies that operate submarine cables (which are worth hundreds of millions of dollars) use network-management software to control the wavelengths that transmit gigabits of data at high speed along the ocean floor. These systems allow operators to monitor data traffic, see cable faults, and add or drop wavelengths transmitting data (resembling other Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems). They enable remote control of entire cables and are vulnerable to a wide array of attacks because they use common operating systems like Linux and Windows. Furthermore, network management systems often are connected to remote operating centers through networked connections and even linked to the internet. Michael Sechrist wrote about the systems’ risks:

A hacker penetrates a cable management system, gains administrative rights, and hacks into the presentation server … Hackers could then attain unprecedented top-level views of multiple cable networks and data flows, discover physical cable vulnerabilities, and disrupt and divert data traffic. With that access, hackers/attackers can gain a potential “kill click” – with a click of a mouse they can delete wavelengths and, potentially, significantly disrupt or alter global Internet traffic routes.

Many network management systems are not up-to-date, including older Siemens systems. The Stuxnet worm hit Siemens SCADA systems worldwide and ultimately targeted Iran’s nuclear centrifuges—highlighting how malware can attack critical infrastructure vulnerabilities. One Stuxnet lesson of relevance to undersea cables is how the virus masked its presence by feeding false information to monitoring centers. If a piece of malware similarly hides its effects on cable traffic, the time it would take to identify the faults with the system could prolong global disruptions.

**International Law on Damage to Submarine Cables**

Understanding the international laws governing cables is essential to protecting them.

First, international law differentiates between attacks on cables and espionage. Spying operations on cables consist of passively tapping the information coming through the pipes at landing sites.

The earliest international law agreement on the topic is the Convention on the Protection of Submarine Cables, signed in Paris in 1884. The treaty applies to all cables outside the territorial waters of states and requires all states to incorporate its protections into their domestic law. Article 2 mandates that “the breaking or injury of a submarine cables, done willfully or through culpable negligence...shall be a punishable offense.” In Article 12, the parties agree to implement national legislation to impose the penalties for violating the treaty. Notably, Article 15 says its provisions “shall in no wise [sic] affect the liberty of action of belligerents.” Thus, in wartime, the protections do not apply.

Maritime law is also important to undersea cable governance. The 1958 Geneva Conference on the Law of the Sea addressed submarine cables in two treaties, the Convention on the High Seas and the Convention on the Continental Shelf. The High Seas Convention included the submarine cable protections of the 1884 Convention but in the context of the “freedom to lay submarine cables,” a fundamental freedoms of the high seas “recognized by the general principles of international law.” Article 27 addresses damage to cables, but it does not explicitly prohibit the intentional damage to them. Instead, it mandates that states party to the treaty “take the necessary legislative measures” to make breaking a cable a “punishable offense.”

The 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) superseded the 1958 Geneva Conventions. This landmark agreement addressed submarine cables in multiple chapters. Articles 113-115 replicate the language from the 1958 convention requiring states to enact domestic legislation penalizing damage to cables by ships or persons.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, including their vulnerabilities, legal protections, and specific incidents of damage.

It directly mentions 'cutting cables' and provides examples of both accidental and intentional damage, thus treating the topic as central rather than peripheral.

The implications for internet connectivity are also clearly articulated, satisfying the criterion."

Alarm bells went off following reports last week that the U.S. is concerned about Russian ships operating near vital undersea cables, and that Russia could damage those cables in times of conflict or tension. At stake is the safety of the vast network of cables around the globe that carry almost all of the world’s Internet communications and financial transactions. As it happens, Russia may not have an incentive to damage those cables, since it would also suffer from any disruption in communications, according to experts at Wharton and New York University. However, the threat of cyber attacks on those cables is real, they said.

Severed cables can be easily repaired, albeit with heavy costs, and the bigger risk is from unintentional, routine cable breaks. The best defense against such threats is to avoid the existing concentration of cable landings along U.S. coasts, according to the experts. Instead, those landings should be dispersed so that all systems don’t go down in a crisis and have sufficient capacity to re-route communications traffic, they said.

The first reports last week painted a grim scenario. “The ultimate Russian hack on the United States could involve severing the fiber-optic cables at some of their hardest-to-access locations to halt the instant communications on which the West’s governments, economies and citizens have grown dependent,” a _New York Times_ report warned. The U.S. has not formally responded to the perceived Russian threat, but the _Times_ report quoted a Navy spokesman who said, “It would be a concern to hear any country was tampering with communication cables.” Coincidentally, President Obama had designated October as “National Cyber Security Awareness Month” to raise awareness about cyber security.

**What Is at Stake?**

The consequences would be huge in the event of “a systematic, large-scale attempt” to break undersea cables that proves difficult to remediate, said Wharton risk management professor Robert Meyer. It could disrupt up to 90% of global Internet traffic and financial transactions, he added. Meyer is also co-director of Wharton’s Risk Management and Decision Processes Center. However, he said it isn’t clear if Russia would want to damage the cables. “If you are sitting on a limb, would you want to cut off the branch?” Such damage is more likely caused by terrorists, he added.

> “The more viable option is to build a more geographically diverse network of cables.” –Nicole Starosielski

Undersea cables routinely snap and get quickly repaired, noted Nicole Starosielski, professor of media, culture and communication at New York University’s Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. She rated attempts to protect undersea cables with patrolling ships as an unviable idea, given the vastness of the network. “The cables could be broken by any boat that drops an anchor,” she said. “The biggest threats are regular, unintentional breaks” – not intentional disruption.

“The more viable option is to build a more geographically diverse network of cables,” said Starosielski. She is also the author of _The Undersea Network_, a book that looked at the collection of undersea cables built over 150 years. She noted industry groups have for long sought policies that would facilitate the development of cable networks that avoid the concentration of pressure points along both U.S. coasts.

Meyer and Starosielski discussed ways to mitigate threats to subsea cables on the Knowledge at Wharton show on Wharton Business Radio on SiriusXM channel 111. (Listen to the podcast at the top of this page.)

Starosielski noted that while concerns about the security of undersea cables are not new, they are heightened now because of the widespread dependency on them. She pointed out that it is difficult to calculate the economic cost of damage to those cables, but added that some estimates put it at more than a billion dollars for South Korea and $3 billion for Australia, for example.

**Perils of Concentration**

Starosielski pointed to tele-geography maps that reveal the “pressure points,” or the concentration of the cable landings in the U.S. Many cable landings are around New York, in Long Island and New Jersey, among other locations, and then around Miami – but there are no other cable landings in between those two clusters on the U.S. East Coast. On the U.S. West Coast, the major cable landings are concentrated around Los Angeles, San Francisco, central California and Oregon, she noted.

“In the U.S., we have about 50 cables coming in to about 20 zones – they are not evenly distributed along the coast; they are clumped together,” said Starosielski. Typically, if a cable is cut, and it does not exclusively belong to any country, the traffic it carries is re-routed to another cable because they are not all full, she explained. But there could be major problems if the cables that are cut are in the pressure points.

> “The biggest threats are regular, unintentional breaks – not intentional disruption.” –Nicole Starosielski

The concentration of cable landings occurs because cable companies find it more economically viable to go to an existing cable station, where they can interconnect with all the other networks, said Starosielski. “There is not an economic incentive to diversify the network.”

One comforting fact, according to Starosielski, is that much of the U.S. communications infrastructure is within the country in the form of data centers and Internet exchanges, unlike some other countries that depend on overseas infrastructure. “If you were to sever these cables, it would cause a catastrophic impact, especially on financial institutions, but it would not necessarily sever us from all networks,” she said. “But that is not true for all countries.”

**Low Threat Visibility**

Meyer pointed to inadequacies in the perceptions of those threats faced by undersea cables and landing stations. “Many people, including in government, are not aware of the scale of the importance of cables and how they are the lifeblood of global communications,” he said. Starosielski noted that that the each cable is usually the size of a garden hose, but carries massive amounts of information. “An entire country could make phone calls at the same time through one of these cables,” she noted.

Meyer recalled the findings of a survey last year at the World Economic Forum of 900 business leaders and academics, in which cyber attacks ranked No. 10 on a list of potential threats. When respondents were asked about which attacks would have the greatest impact, cyber attacks did not even make it to the Top 10, he added. Meyer attributed those responses to a mistaken belief that inherent redundancy would take care of any attack on the cables. “The mere knowledge that we have these wires going underneath the ocean that one can clip … would be a wakeup call for a lot of people.”

**Repairs and Re-routing**

As it happens, repairs of undersea cables are not exactly high-tech, although they could be expensive if they are far out in the ocean, said Starosielski. Typically, damaged cables are brought up from the deep ocean and the two ends are spliced together on the surface before being lowered again in the sea. Repairs to cables in coastal locations sometimes prove difficult and time-consuming as they require permits from governments, she added.

> “The mere knowledge that we have these wires going underneath the ocean that one can clip … would be a wakeup call for a lot of people.” –Robert Meyer

The ordinary citizen does not feel disruptions because redundancies in the system absorb the re-routing of traffic from broken cables, said Starosielski. However, when cable breaks occur in any of the pressure points, or zones of concentration of landings, the impact could be huge, said Starosielski.

For example, the 2006 Hengchun earthquake off Taiwan triggered an undersea landslide that severed nine of the 11 cables running through the Luzon Strait between Taiwan and the Philippines, and took 49 days to be repaired, said Starosielski. However, the 2011 Fukushima earthquake in Japan did not cause as much disruption because the cable networks were more diverse and not concentrated, she added.

**Facing Vulnerabilities**

According to Meyer, the biggest concern is not that the cables would be cut, but the threat of hack attacks into the information they carry. He noted that cable networks are typically managed by remote software installations. “If a terrorist were to get hold of the management system and take the information from there, they would get access to the financial information which is flowing,” he said. “That would be much scarier and more difficult thing to control than simply cutting the cables, because — as Nicole Starosielski said — we could get a ship out and splice it back together again.”

Meyer called for a stronger appreciation of the repercussions of attacks on undersea cables to drive business and policy responses. He talked of “a tendency to worry about … the failures that are most easy to imagine.” Even if damaged cables could be repaired, an understanding of “how people’s lives would be disrupted by a five- or six-day shutdown of all financial transactions and the Internet would have a profound impact,” he said. “It is one of a number of risks that are sitting out there and would have very large impact that people don’t particularly think about, and the hope is we don’t have to worry about it.","The article 'Managing Risks for the World’s Undersea Cable Network' provides a comprehensive discussion on undersea cables, including direct mentions of their risks, potential for being cut, and the implications for global internet connectivity and financial transactions.

November 03, 2015 11:00 pm • Last Updated: November 05, 2015 8:16 pm  

A small, bipartisan group of senators including Chris Murphy, D-Conn., have written to the secretaries of defense, state and homeland security, asking for information on ""steps taken to enhance the security of our vital undersea network,"" after recent reports of Russian ships operating near undersea fiber optic cables.

The majority of the world's telecommunications and Internet traffic flow through these cables, which are usually 1 to 2 inches thick.

""Undersea communication cables are responsible for moving trillions of dollars in global business, more than 95 percent of daily communications, and matters extremely significant to our national security,"" the senators' letter says.

The senators are ""increasingly concerned"" about cables whose locations are well known and carry data important to our economy and military.

The first transatlantic cables were laid in the 1860s, according to Thomas Fedyszyn, a member of the Naval War College's Naval Security Affairs faculty and the college director of the Europe-Russia Studies Group.

The route they were laid on essentially became the main pathway for future cables, Fedyszyn said.

""It's always been presumed that militaries will always have additional cables that will carry classified materials,"" Fedyszyn said by phone Wednesday.

The New York Times last month reported that ""Russian submarines and spy ships are aggressively operating near the vital undersea cables that carry almost all global Internet communications.""

""Maybe it's just a threat, but the Russians wouldn't be snooping around these undersea cables unless they are trying to send a message that they have the capacity to interrupt undersea communications,"" Murphy said in a prepared statement.

""The ultimate Russian hack on the United States could involve severing the fiber-optic cables at some of their hardest-to-access locations to halt the instant communications on which the West's governments, economies and citizens have grown dependent,"" The New York Times article says.

The ""worst of all possible worlds"" in this situation, according to Fedyszyn, is that the Russians ""hack the cables without us knowing it.""

If a cable gets cut, it's more clear what's happening, and we'd have to find other ways to get information, Fedyszyn said.

""A submarine is of course the perfect tool to do this stuff,"" he said.

The U.S. government considers the undersea cables ""critical infrastructure."" Generally speaking, the armed services are involved in the protection of critical infrastructure.

The Obama Administration's 2015 National Security Strategy states: ""We are fortifying our critical infrastructure against all hazards, especially cyber espionage and attack.""

""Drawing on the voluntary cybersecurity framework, we are securing Federal networks and working with the private sector, civil society, and other stakeholders to strengthen the security and resilience of U.S. critical infrastructure,"" the document goes on to say.

In their letter, the senators requested ""information on what steps are being taken, and what steps need to be taken, in order to enhance the security of the undersea network on which the U.S. depends. We wish to discuss this matter further with you in a classified setting, while doing everything possible to allow the public to know we are taking every step to maintain their security.""

As for the vulnerability of the cables, Fedyszyn said, ""If found and the enemy wants them cut, I would say very vulnerable.""

The biggest part of the vulnerability, he continued, is location, as in locating the cables.

Asked what he'd be thinking if he were a Pentagon official, Fedyszyn said, ""I'm watching the Russian fleet.""

One of his assignments during his 31-year naval career was as the U.S. Naval attaché to Russia.

Starting in 2008, Russia began to modernize its Navy, Fedyszyn said, ""which really got very bad between 1990 and 2008.""

He saw that firsthand when he was the attaché in Moscow.

In 2008, Russia ""started to get money, started to get directed again,"" Fedyszyn said, and we're ""just now beginning to see the modern ships coming off the shipways to include submarines,"" though still in small numbers.

""What we have to do, just like we did in the Cold War, is to watch their submarines,"" Fedyszyn said. ""That's difficult work.""

And its appearance coincides with what researchers say is a marked uptick in the instability of Internet traffic in that country.

The ship, named Yantar, is currently positioned off the coast of Lebanon and is moving on a northern track towards Syria, according to public vessel tracking data. Dyn, a U.S.-based company that tracks Internet outages around the world, reports a dip in the number of available networks in Syria in recent days.

Undersea cables are frequently cut by accident, including by ship anchors dragging on the ocean floor. It’s possible that the Internet outages in Syria and Yantar’s presence in the neighborhood are merely a coincidence.

But the Internet in Syria has a history of going down at times that the regime of Bashar al-Assad has plotted military offensives, raising the possibility that Russia may be assisting in a communications blackout as its military forces pound rebel positions in the beleaguered city of Aleppo.

The ship is technically classified as a research vessel, but it’s equipped with a pair of remote submarines that U.S. officials have said are capable of severing the cables miles under the ocean’s surface that carry global Internet communications.

Yantar cruised off the coast of the United States last year en route to Cuba, and was monitored along the way by American intelligence satellites, according to The New York Times. At the time, officials said they were monitoring a surge in Russian submarine activity along undersea cable routes.

Defense officials told The Daily Beast that they couldn’t confirm the presence of the Yantar near the Syrian coast.

Late last October David Sanger and Eric Schmitt wrote an interesting story in the New York Times outlining US concerns about Russian navy activity near the world’s undersea cables. They said:

> Russian submarines and spy ships are aggressively operating near the vital undersea cables that carry almost all global Internet communications, raising concerns among some American military and intelligence officials that the Russians might be planning to attack those lines in times of tension or conflict.

> The issue goes beyond old worries during the Cold War that the Russians would tap into the cables — a task American intelligence agencies also mastered decades ago. The alarm today is deeper: The ultimate Russian hack on the United States could involve severing the fiber-optic cables at some of their hardest-to-access locations to halt the instant communications on which the West’s governments, economies and citizens have grown dependent.

You got the sense from the story that intelligence officials wanted to get the story out:

> In private, however, commanders and intelligence officials are far more direct. They report that from the North Sea to Northeast Asia and even in waters closer to American shores, they are monitoring significantly increased Russian activity along the known routes of the cables, which carry the lifeblood of global electronic communications and commerce.

Let’s think about this for a minute. If a war were to take place between NATO and, say, Russia, what would be some likely Russian strategies? Clearly US officials are expressing concern here about undersea cables, which carry the bulk of internet traffic globally — most specifically between the US and Europe.

In such a scenario it would make sense for Russia not simply to cut these cables, but instead to mine them — and mine them in multiple locations. Indeed you could argue it would make sense to mine them in advance of any possible conflict, but merely as a contingency. So maybe they already are? And it might be also logical to conclude that NATO might do the same, though that seems a little less likely.

If an adversary could cut most or all commercial undersea cables simultaneously (nevermind the secret military ones) it would have a hugely destabilising affect on Western economies. Communications during or in the leadup to conflict are obviously critical, but since the end of the Cold War large portions of global commerce also rely on these undersea cables — which by their nature are vulnerable. Here’s some stuff from McKinsey, emphasis mine:

> New McKinsey research into the Internet economies of the G-8 nations as well as Brazil, China, India, South Korea, and Sweden finds that the web accounts for a significant and growing portion of global GDP. Indeed, if measured as a sector, Internet-related consumption and expenditure is now bigger than agriculture or energy. On average, the Internet contributes 3.4 percent to GDP in the 13 countries covered by the research — an amount the size of Spain or Canada in terms of GDP, and growing at a faster rate than that of Brazil.

Besides the affect on GDP, there’s also the affect on trading and international markets.

And don’t forget yourself: if those undersea cables were cut tomorrow, your reliance on cloud-based services would immediately become a liability. No more Google Drive, Gmail, Netflix, Dropbox, Amazon, or any of the other services you rely on daily for storing your files or organising yourself. In fact, try using your laptop for a day without internet access. Those of us who used computers in the early 1990s remember those days, but many people have no concept of what this feels like.

We have become so used to broadband and cloud storage that we forget nowadays that our computers are often merely dumb terminals, interfacing with a large infrastructure that does most of the heavy lifting.

If you were a worrier, I’d invest in some hard drives and store your key stuff locally. It’s good practice regardless of any future global conflagration.","The article discusses the vulnerabilities of undersea cables, mentioning potential threats from Russian military activity and the implications of cutting these cables.

This week, the New York Times published a longer article, speculating the ""Yantar"" is part of a larger Russian intelligence operation collecting information about deep sea communication cables.

The newspaper has spoken to commanders and intelligence officials reporting significantly increased Russian activity along the known routes of underwater cables, from the North Sea to Northeast Asia. Pentagon officials suspect the vessel’s equipment is being used to surveil the seafloor for sensors, and may even be cutting underwater communication cables.

Underwater communication cables are vital to global data communications, both civilian and military.

While US spy agencies might believe the ""Yantar"" is a spy-vessel, the Russian Navy insists it is an oceanographic research vessel.

The Admiral said this would especially be the case in the Arctic. Photos of the vessel's arrival to Severomorsk are posted on the portal of the Russian Ministry of Defence.

The New York Times writes the vessel has two deep-diving mini-submarines on board.

_The New York Times_ reports that US defense and intelligence officials have been expressing increased concern about the ""aggressive"" activities by the Russian Navy's submarine and spy ship fleet in the proximity of critical undersea communications cables, perhaps assessing them for potential attack in the event of a crisis. There's no evidence that the Russians (or anyone else) have cut cables yet, but the intelligence agencies of the US and its allies have observed increased activity by the Russian fleet along cable routes, even close to the United States.

The US has long been known to have tapped undersea cables for intelligence collection. One early example is a US program in the 1970s called Operation Ivy Bells, which attached a listening device to Soviet communications cables in the Sea of Okhostsk linking facilities in the Kuril Island chain, recording unencrypted communications on tapes that were retrieved by divers monthly. The program ended in 1981 after a National Security Agency employee sold information about the program to the Soviets for $35,000.

While no US Navy or intelligence officials would go on the record regarding their concerns, the Navy's Commander of US Naval Forces Europe and US Naval Forces Africa, Admiral Mark Furguson, noted that Russian submarine patrols have risen in number by nearly 50 percent in the last year. Unnamed military and intelligence officials told the Times that much of the activity is happening along cable routes. A European diplomat, unnamed by NYT, was quoted as saying, ""The level of activity is comparable to what we saw in the Cold War.""

In September, the Russian Navy's oceanographic research ship Yantar, carrying unmanned underwater surveillance vehicles, was observed operating near the US Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and elsewhere in the Caribbean. According to reports, it was believed to be surveying Caribbean undersea cable networks. The US operates similar ships, including the USNS Impeccable (T-AGOS-23), which conduct underwater ""surveys"" with devices such as the Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System (SURTASS). One of those surveys happened in the South China Sea in 2009 and led to a confrontation with Chinese naval vessels.

While cable breaks happen all the time because of seismic activity or even shark attacks, a concerted effort to cut multiple undersea cables could cause disruption of the global Internet and have both economic and military repercussions. Despite its network of communications satellites, the US military is heavily dependent on undersea cables for much of its communications.

While it's possible that the Russians could simply be looking for locations where submarines can deploy gear and possibly divers to tap into communications cables for surveillance purposes, officials told the Times it is more likely that they were looking for hard-to-reach locations to cut cables during future operations. Such locations would make it difficult and time-consuming to repair cables, maximizing the impact of cuts.","The article discusses the Russian Navy's activities near undersea cables and the potential for these activities to result in cutting cables.

While it does not explicitly mention 'cut sea cables,' it raises concerns about possible future disruptions and the strategic importance of these cables.

As Navy spokesman Cmdr. William Marks adds, ""It would be a concern to hear any country was tampering with communication cables."" Indeed. Well, unless those tampering with international communication cables happen to be working on behalf of the “good guys” in the National Security Agency, or their equally good partners in Britain’s GCHQ. In that case, don’t consider it “tampering,” but rather something more akin to protecting the homeland from 21st century threats.

Of course whenever official Washington warns of a looming foreign cyber threat (China and Iran being the other favorite punching bags of the _Times_ in this regard), it’s worth remembering that it was in fact the U.S., in partnership with Israel, that was the first state to actually launch a major offensive cyber attack on a sovereign nation. The attack being the Stuxnet virus set loose back in 2009 on Iran’s peaceful nuclear program. Such aggression was codified earlier this year when the Pentagon formally unveiled a cyber warfare doctrine sanctioning the use of preemptive strikes. But down the memory hole, it appears, with all that.

And so with all that out of mind, it’s back to Russia’s rising “aggression.” At least as the paper of record would have it.

As Sanger and Schmitt continue, ""American concern over cable-cutting is just one aspect of Russia’s modernizing Navy that has drawn new scrutiny.""

Adm. Mark Ferguson, commander of American naval forces in Europe, speaking in Washington this month, said the proficiency and operational tempo of the Russian submarine force was increasing.

Citing public remarks by the Russian Navy chief, Adm. Viktor Chirkov, Admiral Ferguson said the intensity of Russian submarine patrols had risen by almost 50 percent over the last year. Russia has increased its operating tempo to levels not seen in over a decade. Russian Arctic bases and their $2.4 billion investment in the Black Sea Fleet expansion by 2020 demonstrate their commitment to develop their military infrastructure on the flanks, he said.

Left unmentioned by either Adm. Ferguson or the _Times_ is the fact that the U.S. Navy’s fiscal year 2016 budget comes in at an astounding $161 billion. (For comparison, the _entire_ Russian military’s FY 2016 budget is projected to come in just over $90 billion.) If scrutiny then is to be applied, one would think that the U.S. Navy’s budgetary windfall would offer plenty of fodder. For starters, it’s worth considering just how many food-insecure American children could be fed with $161 billion.

Capturing the essence of the official propaganda campaign seeking to depict Russia as some sort of dangerously revisionist power, Sanger and Schmitt go on in their piece to quote Adm. James Stavridis, NATO’s former top military commander and current dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. As Stavridis puts it, Russia’s supposed stepped up surveillance of undersea cables offers ""yet another example of a highly assertive and aggressive regime seemingly reaching backwards for the tools of the Cold War, albeit with a high degree of technical improvement."" Russia has indeed deployed its military forces in the last year to both Ukraine and Syria. (A fact _Times_ readers are certainly well aware of.) But if that is a sign of a “highly assertive and aggressive regime,” what are we to make of a regime that in the past decade alone invaded and toppled governments in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya? What shall we call a regime that has bombed Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Libya, Yemen, Syria, and Pakistan? What about a regime that unleashed a preemptive cyber attack on Iran? How about a regime with over 800 foreign military bases? Or one that exported nearly $50 billion in arms in the last year alone?

Global public opinion has of course already settled on what we are to call such a regime. According to a 2013 WIN/Gallop poll surveying the opinions of individuals from 65 nations around the world, it is the U.S. that constitutes “the greatest threat to peace in the world.” Russia didn’t register in the poll.

The recent historical record, then, reveals the latest Russian hit piece offered by the _Times_ to be little more than Washington projection. The Russian Navy, all propaganda aside, hardly possesses much of a noteworthy threat to the U.S. Navy, let alone global Internet communications. To find the greatest threat to global Internet communications we must once again heed global public opinion and come face to face with the menace within.","The article titled ""NYT Hypes Russian Threat to the Internet"" by Ben Schreiner discusses concerns regarding Russian military activities near undersea cables, which are crucial for global internet communications.

Almost all the countries in the world expect their foreign intelligence services to tap and sift through international telecommunications. For that reason, network operators whose lines cross international borders are legally obliged to make certain intersection points available to the authorities. Britain's Tempora program, for instance, had perfectly legal access to the information it obtained - at least when it passed through British territory.

**From electricity to light, and back**

But fiber-optic cables can also be tapped secretly, without the knowledge of the operators - though this is not exactly easy. To understand how it works, one has to look more closely at how the data actually passes through the cables.

A standard fiber-optic cable laid across land consists of 144 individual glass fibers, while undersea cables consist of a maximum of eight individual fibers. Using laser technology, the electronic data is initially turned into ultra-short flashes of light. These flashes represent the zeros and ones that all digital information is comprised of. A photodiode at the end of the cable turns the light flashes back into electrical signals.

Around 10 billion such flashes of light run through these cables every second, and each one can also transfer between 1.2 and 5 gigabytes of data per second. But since the capacity of fiber optics is never completely used up, in practice the data flow is usually equivalent to between one and five standard CDs.

**Fiber optics need amplifiers**

But after a certain distance, the data signal drops. Every 80 kilometers or so, the signals have to be re-amplified, explained Klaus-Dieter Langer of the Fraunhofer Heinrich-Hertz-Institute in Berlin.

Thousands of miles of fiber optic cables are laid across the ocean floor.

This is done with the help of a ""regenerator."" Undersea cables also have regenerators, which are supplied with electricity by copper cables laid across the ocean floor, together with the fiber optics.

These regenerators are the system's weak point. At these spots, the fiber optics can be more easily tapped, because they are no longer bundled together, rather laid out individually (since each fiber must be amplified separately). At these points, data piracy is not necessarily easy - but that, as Langer puts it, is ""just a technical hurdle.""

A vigilant network operator can spot such hacking attempts. ""You need very sensitive measuring instruments,"" said Langer, ""then you can see when the signal strength suddenly dips.""

**Order in the data chaos**

Once a spy has succeeded in hacking into a cable, the bigger challenge emerges - sifting through the immense mass of data. This needs to be done quickly. Even if a single glass cable is operating only at 50 percent capacity, it can still deliver 10 terabytes of data in an hour. ""Since storage capacity is finite, the trick is to analyze these 10 terabytes within an hour, and filter out what you're looking for,"" said Langer.

A lot of the data needs to be decrypted - which also means being temporarily stored. At the same time, intelligence agencies must proceed very selectively so as not to get bogged down in the flood of data. Langer believes that agents probably concentrate on single fibers belonging to certain operators of particular interest. ""It makes more sense to search for certain content, rather than, for example, email conversations, telephone connections and the like.

**Wire-tapping contest under the ocean**

Hacking a cable only makes sense if you have large server capacity immediately available, which is why Langer is skeptical of recent media speculation about the USS Jimmy Carter, a nuclear submarine said to be on a mission to tap underwater cables. ""It seems bizarre,"" said Langer.

Huge server capacity must be immediately available to sift data.

But Peter Franck, spokesman for the Chaos Computer Club digital rights collective, considers the submarine reports ""absolutely believable."" Though tapping underwater cables is so secret ""that it would never be publicly talked about,"" so far reports in the American media have not been denied by the government.

Franck can imagine a number of ways in which data could be moved from the submarine to servers on shore. He speculates, for instance, that the data could be pre-filtered on board and then broadcast to a base via the normal radio communication. Or a device that records the data could be left on the ocean floor. ""An extra vehicle could then come and pick it up,"" Franck suggested.

Such underwater cables are certainly of considerable interest to intelligence agencies, since a huge part of international communication travels through them. It could certainly be the case that a lot of the world's fiber optic cables are being tapped - and not only in countries where respective intelligence agencies are based.","The article discusses undersea fiber-optic cables in detail, focusing on their vulnerability to tapping by intelligence agencies.

While it does not directly mention 'cut sea cables', it addresses the implications of such cables being tapped and their significance in international telecommunications.

The central theme revolves around the challenges and methods of accessing data from these cables, making it relevant to the topic."

By Jonathan Reed Winkler  
Published Date: 11/06/2015  

The recent New York Times article about the concerns that Russia might be prepared to cut the submarine cables carrying voice and data traffic between North America and Europe conveys the impression that this is new territory for the United States. It is, in fact, not, and as an earlier War on the Rocks article noted, it was something that the United States experienced at the hands of the Germans during World War I. But the United States has itself cut cables in wartime as a means of disrupting the ability of an enemy power to command and control its distant forces. It conducted these operations during the short Spanish-American war of 1898. These actions reflected careful and innovative thinking by naval officers about the strategic significance of a technology central to the global economy of the day.

Documents at the Naval History and Heritage Command website offer a window into the prewar planning and execution of the cable-cutting operations. In addition, a number of participants wrote first-person accounts that appeared in popular and professional journals. Lt. Cameron McRae Winslow, who commanded one of the small craft used to attack cables in the Battle at Punta de la Colorados, published his in The Century Magazine in November 1898. Also, Capt. Caspar F. Goodrich discussed his direction of the cable-cutting efforts of the auxiliary cruiser St. Louis in the United States Naval Institute’s Proceedings in 1900.

The first attacks occurred in the Philippines, as Commodore George Dewey prepared for his extended stay in Manila Bay following his defeat of the Spanish squadron there in May 1898. When the Spanish governor-general refused to grant Dewey the use of the submarine cable from Manila to Hong Kong, Dewey ordered the USS Zafiro to find and sever the cable. Doing so denied both powers rapid electrical communications with their home countries, but Dewey could remain in contact by sending the revenue cutter McCulloch the 600 or so nautical miles to Hong Kong with dispatches. Dewey subsequently ordered the severing of another cable from Manila to Capiz, which cut the rest of the island chain off from Manila.

The more dramatic attacks on the cables were in the Caribbean theater, where Spain was dependent upon other countries for its cable communications with the colonies of Puerto Rico and Cuba. Two cable connections served Puerto Rico, including one at the capital of San Juan. But Cuba’s connections were more important. On the north side of the island, Havana connected to Key West by cable, making it easy for the United States to silence that connection in Florida. On the south side, several cables linked Cuba’s ports together and connected Cuba to other islands in the West Indies. The critical node was the port of Cienfuegos. If the cables there could be cut, then Havana and the western part of the island would be cut off from Santiago in the east, and thus also cut off from Spain and the rest of the world. Cutting the cables would help to make the blockade more secure.

As Lt. Cameron McRae Winslow later recounted in his Century Magazine article, the initial strikes occurred on May 11. Raiding parties from the cruiser Marblehead and the gunboat Nashville, carried in steam cutters and oar-powered sailing launches, attempted to locate the cables near the Colorados Point lighthouse at the entrance to Cienfuegos. The raiders, a mix of sailors and Marines, brought wire-cutting pliers, axes, hacksaws, and hammers to work over the heavy shore end of the cables they would find. Meanwhile, the Marblehead and Nashville were to provide covering fire against dug-in infantry along the shoreline and attempt to destroy the hut on shore where the cable connected to the telegraph network. The crews lacked any real idea where the cables were located, and the extensive coral prevented easy dragging with grapples. After some effort, however, the crews raised the first heavy cable, which took 30 men to lift onto the steam launches. One of the launches nearly swamped when the cable caught on coral and prevented the vessel from riding the heavy waves. The crews dragged the cable into deeper water, where it took more than 30 minutes to hacksaw. The raiders had to come closer toward the shore to attack the second cable, and as the work carried on Spanish reinforcements arrived at the coast. Lt. Winslow, spotting a third cable almost by accident, decided to attack this smaller one as well, but by this time the boat crews were coming under sustained rifle fire from the Spanish Mausers. Some of the sailors and Marines returned fire, a running gun battle raging while the shells from the Marblehead and Nashville crashed into the rocky shore close enough to spray the crews with rock fragments. As the fighting had become intense, and because the third cable was not important, the raiders withdrew to safety. It is remarkable, in retrospect, that 51 of the 112 Congressional Medals of Honor awarded in the Spanish–American War went to participants in this attack.

Within days the Navy stepped up its attacks on the remaining cables. Capt. Caspar F. Goodrich, who commanded the auxiliary cruiser St. Louis, later recounted in his article for Proceedings a conversation aboard the converted warship among his officers about how to make their ship more useful in the war effort. They settled on attacking cables, something that they had not done before. On May 13, the ship dragged up the cable between Puerto Rico and St. Thomas and cut it. Five days later, the St. Louis with the assistance of the Wompatuck attacked the cables off Santiago de Cuba that connected to Jamaica, while exchanging fire with the Spanish batteries around Morro Castle. They could not find the cables connecting Santiago to Cienfuegos. Goodrich recalled:

> We made altogether in the St. Louis and Suwanee no less than fourteen drives for them at points varying from just outside the harbor mouth at Santiago to ten miles distant but we never succeeded in getting the wire or bringing up anything more than the grapnel itself with its prongs straightened out like the ribs of an inverted umbrella. The Santiago-Cienfuegos cables were our conspicuous failure.

The last attacks occurred on July 7, when the St. Louis attacked three more cables in Guantanamo Bay that connected Cuba to Haiti and Puerto Rico. The auxiliary cruiser Yankee and the cruiser Marblehead provided covering fire against both shore batteries and two Spanish gunboats determined to score some successes against the attacking Americans.

The efforts by the United States to cut Spain off from all contact with her colonies was not simply a spur of the moment action by clever officers. U.S. officials had considered these moves before the war. These wartime actions would provide important precedents and lessons about the rights and responsibilities of belligerents and neutrals over submarine cables in the future. Several of the cut cables belonged to British and French companies, not the Spanish. But the value of these cables negated their presumably neutral status. Not surprisingly, the British government would accept that cutting a neutral’s cable could be a proper military measure in wartime — a right that Britain herself would want, and would use, as a belligerent in the future. The strategic importance of cutting an opponent off from the rest of the world would be one of the important lessons drawn from the war, as Capt. George O. Squier of the U.S. Army Signal Corps would describe in an article for National Geographic magazine in 1901. Cables owned and operated by the enemy would become not only targets but valuable war prizes to be kept by the winner after a war. And, dependence upon a neutral’s cable network could become a vulnerability — in the eyes of some officers, the United States would only be safe if its own cable connections to places like the newly acquired Philippines were in U.S. hands. Such precedents and lessons continue to inform thinking about the security of international communications today.

Russian submarines and spy ships have been observed in the North Sea, in waters near Northeast Asia, and even in locations closer to American shores such as off the coast of Cuba, reported _The New York Times_.

The fiber optic cables are crucial for American communication with allies as well as the flow of global commerce. More than 95 percent of daily communications are transmitted via these undersea cables, and financial institutions finalize transactions on them every second, amounting to more than $10 trillion in business every day.

The cables are commonly severed due to natural disasters and dragging anchors, but this generally occurs near landing points on shore, making the damage easy to repair quickly. Russian vessels appear to be scouting cable locations at significant depths where any damage would be difficult to locate and fix. Pentagon officials are also worried that Russia might be seeking secret cables in undisclosed locations that are used for United States military operations, the _Times_ says.

It is also possible to tap into undersea cables and acquire the information that is flowing through them. Intelligence officials told _The New York Times_ that the United States Navy submarine _Jimmy Carter_ is capable of doing just that.

Not even two years into what will be a ten-year tenure at China’s helm, Xi Jinping has already made his mark on China’s foreign policy, in particular with the launch of the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, also known as the New Silk Road. This initiative will manifest in a vast network of transportation, energy and communication projects, all of which are supposed to boost intraregional trade and ultimately give China and its neighbors a sense of “common destiny.”  

Although not as well publicized, the planned improvements in telecommunications infrastructure are as critical to business and economic development as the railroad projects that are to be technically and financially supported by China through its New Silk Road initiative. The virtual cloud of cyberspace relies on a physical infrastructure that constitutes the sinews of the Internet. Because cables can be laid easily along rail lines, the future Eurasian fiber optic backbones will benefit from the transportation infrastructure that will soon stretch along the Silk Road. For landlocked countries such as the Central Asian Republics, this will mean greater access to international data networks, at a cost averaging a tenth that of satellite communications and with a bandwidth significantly enhanced by fiber optic technology.  

A number of projects are already underway. In 2006 the telecom giant ZTE was commissioned by Afghanistan to establish the country’s first fiber optic cable network, the same year that Huawei, another Chinese firm, received a contract from the government of Tajikistan. China and Russia have also partnered in building major terrestrial telecommunication links across the Eurasian continent, including the world’s longest terrestrial cable link, the Trans-Europe Asia (TEA), in addition to the Europe-Russia-Mongolia-China network, the TransEurasian Information Superhighway (TASIM), and the Diverse Route for European and Asian Markets (DREAM). The last of these is an ambitious Eurasian fiber optic communication land line whose launch was announced by Russia’s MegaFon in October 2013; it will be built with equipment supplied by China’s Huawei.  

While domestic networks are mostly terrestrial, underwater fiber optic cables carry the vast majority of international data traffic. Thus Asia and Europe are currently digitally connected, via the Suez Canal thanks, among other things, to the world’s longest submarine cable, the 39,000 km SEA-ME- WE 3 system. Digital packets transmitted from Western Europe to Japan either have to traverse Europe, the Middle East, the Indian Ocean and the China Seas, or ride through the Atlantic, the U.S., and then the Pacific Ocean. The global undersea system experiences several hundred disruptions per year, especially at heavily trafficked choke points such as the Strait of Malacca or the Suez Canal, where too many cables pass through a narrow maritime passage. Regular disruptions occur when ships drag their anchors across cables lying on the ocean floor. In addition to increasing the connectivity of landlocked countries that stretch along the Silk Road, the envisioned terrestrial trans-Eurasian networks will alleviate the possible risks of disruption to maritime cables and add redundancy: Terrestrial cables also face disruptions, but they are easier to repair and maintain than the ones that lie 8,000 meters underwater.  

The land digital highways will also increase the speed of data exchanges between Europe and Asia, a major challenge that telecommunication companies are racing to meet. Investors are willing to spend several hundreds of millions of dollars to gain a few milliseconds in highly profitable “high frequency trading” – a system where computers buy and sell automatically and electronically. By some estimates, a one millisecond advantage could be worth up to $100 million a year for hedge fund companies. Shorter routes are therefore the key to speed – and profit. The melting of the Arctic ice cap has created the possibility of opening new routes linking Asia to Europe and Trans-Arctic Ocean submarine cables are now being installed, with the aim of reducing by 30 percent the time a packet takes to travel from Tokyo to London. But maintaining the cables remains an obvious challenge and the Silk Road routes offer a sound alternative for customers looking for increased speed and reliability.  

In addition to commercial motivations, the new fiber optic Silk Road could also have geopolitical and strategic implications. Russia and China evidently share a desire to shield themselves from U.S. and other Western intelligence agencies and probably believe that their own communications – both with one another and to and from Europe – will be better protected if cables run across their own territory rather than through the Indian Ocean or the U.S. The same motivation explains the announced Telebras cable, which will connect Brazil to Portugal without any U.S. technology, and the BRICS cable project, which will link Vladivostok to Brazil, via China, India and South Africa. There is a growing wariness among these countries that when their data traffic goes through hubs in Europe or the U.S., it incurs a greater “risk of potential interception of critical financial and security information by non-BRICS entities,” according to Andrew Mthembu, a South African businessman who is promoting the BRICS cable.  

Together with planned roads, rail and pipelines, the fiber optic “Silk Road” will tie the Central Asian states more closely to China and Russia. These countries may also hope that the new cables will circumvent NSA attempts to eavesdrop on the data sent through U.S. IT companies. But they may well find themselves subjected to increased electronic surveillance by Beijing or Moscow, or both. Russia and China’s perceived security risks, reinforced by Edward Snowden’s revelations about the electronic surveillance carried out by the U.S. government through digital channels, will lead to more alternative routes provided by non-American companies, conceivably making it easier to seal off the global network if deemed necessary. Paradoxically, the emergence of alternative networks could eventually increase the digital balkanization of some parts of the world.

In doing so, Yantar ruffled feathers at the Pentagon, passing close by / over the landing spot of an important communications cable connecting the American naval station at Guantanamo Bay to the US.

The Yantar sailed past the Turks and Caicos Island on 1 September before calling at Havana Port, Cuba. After crossing the Atlantic it arrived in Murmansk on 28 October.

The Yantar’s movements have drawn comments from US officials who have been worried for months about the increase in tempo of Russian naval activities, particularly submarine activity near important cable exchanges. One European diplomatic source recently described the intensity of Russian submarine patrols as having risen by 50% in the past year and are “now at a level comparable to that of the Cold War.”

The Yantar, with two remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) capable of carrying out deep sea operations has cable surveying and cutting potential. According to the New York Times, “Cables carry global business worth more than $10 trillion a day, including from financial institutions that settle transactions on them every second. Any significant disruption would cut the flow of capital. The cables also carry more than 95 percent of daily communications.” The severance of a single major cable could cause billions of dollars of financial damage and majorly disrupt a wide range of communications.

Whilst it is common for cables to be damaged and severed by ship anchors, storms and natural disasters, breakages usually occur a few miles offshore and can be repaired in a few days. What particularly worries the Pentagon is that Russia appears to be probing for weaknesses in cable systems at much greater depths, a long way from shore, where a severance would be very difficult to repair. MarineTraffic data on the Yantar’s return transatlantic voyage shows the vessel spent nine days surveying a patch of the Atlantic over 1000km east of Grenada with depths ranging from around 2000m – 4000m.

The United States is of course no stranger to subsea cable operations and tapping. In 1971 the US Navy carried out Operation ‘Ivy Bells’ during which a modified submarine, the USS Halibut was sent into the Sea of Okhotsk acting on intelligence received about a Soviet communications cable. Divers working from the submarine found the cable and installed a 6m long device around the cable pipe that recorded all communications travelling through it. Today the USS Jimmy Carter is believed to carry out a great deal of undersea intelligence gathering.

**Surveying, not spying?**

Survey ships come in a range of shapes and sizes and carry out a wide scope of work. Discovery pictured below was delivered to the UK’s National Environment Research Council (NERC) in July 2013 and has since completed nine scientific research voyages. At the time of writing, Discovery was south of the Canary Islands, destined for the Bahamas on a Rapid Climate Change Programme (RAPID) mission where it will collect data from NERC moorings in the Atlantic.

Survey ships also play a commercial role, with operators such as Dutch company Fugro running vessels which carry out surveys on behalf of energy companies. Advanced technology carried on-board survey ships includes multi-beam echo-sounders and sub-bottom profiler systems, enabling seismic surveys to be conducted. Visual representations of the sea floor and what lies beneath it can be created from data collected by seismic surveys. These in turn help geologists predict the location of hydrocarbons and direct exploratory drilling.

A detailed picture of the ocean floor can be of critical importance when working out the parameters and method for a search operation. For this reason, in June 2014 Fugro was awarded a contract by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) as part of the search for missing flight MH370. Advanced survey vessel Fugro Equator began mapping over 200,000 square kilometres of uncharted Southern Indian Ocean seabed using state-of-the-art multibeam echosounder equipment. The resulting bathymetric maps enabled a defined search for the missing aircraft to begin. In October 2014 Fugro Discovery commenced deepwater search operations, equipped with side scan sonar, underwater video and aviation fuel detection sensors.","The article discusses the activities of the Russian Navy’s survey ship Yantar, particularly its proximity to important undersea communication cables.

The mission, code-named “Ivy Bells” was so secret that a majority of the submarine’s sailors had no idea what they had accomplished. The success led to a concealed world of cable tapping.

And a decade ago, the United States Navy launched the submarine Jimmy Carter, which intelligence analysts say is able to tap undersea cables and eavesdrop on communications flowing through them.

But now the same ghost haunts America as Russian submarines and spy ships are aggressively operating near the vital undersea cables that carry almost all global Internet communications, raising concerns among American military and intelligence officials that Russians might be planning to attack those lines in times of tension or conflict. If Russians are successful in hacking on the United States, it could involve severing the fiber-optic cables at some of their hardest-to-access locations to halt the instant communications on which the West’s governments, economies and citizens have grown dependent.

This fact has caused growing wariness among senior American and allied military and intelligence officials over the accelerated activity by Russian armed forces around the globe. At the same time, the internal debate in Washington illustrates how the United States is increasingly viewing every Russian move through a lens of deep distrust, reminiscent of relations during the Cold War.

Just last month, the Russian spy ship Yantar, equipped with two self-propelled deep-sea submersible craft, cruised slowly off the East Coast of the United States on its way to Cuba — where one major cable lands near the American naval station at Guantánamo Bay.

Journalist Kate Murphy has a good, brief, non-technical analysis of the problem in today’s NYT, ""The Cyberthreat Under the Street""(NYT, Sunday Review, November 8, 2015).

Murphy reports that within the last year there have been sixteen “so-called fiber cuts in the San Francisco Bay Area … someone or some group has been going through manholes to sever fiber optic cables that supply telecommunications to the region.” Ominously, following each incident, affected residents “couldn’t make land or mobile calls, not even to 911, or send texts or emails.” The problem, Murphy says, is that when we talk about the Internet, we talk about clouds and ether. But the Internet is not amorphous. You may access it wirelessly, but ultimately you’re relying on a bunch of physical cables that are vulnerable to attack. It’s something that’s been largely forgotten in the lather over cybersecurity. The threat is not only malicious code flowing through the pipes but also, and perhaps more critically, the pipes themselves.

These physical cables have particular points of vulnerability - the “throughways and junctures” that handle vast quantities of Internet traffic - think by analogy of major freeway interchanges and what would happen to traffic in all directions if those junctures were brought down. Murphy reports that there isn’t even a good map of the Internet’s highways and byways, one that would show “locations that, if taken out, would severely hamper the system.” The most important points for possible disruption are the “Internet exchange points,” or I.X.P.s, where the “networks come together” to trade traffic; a handful of vital I.X.P.s, Murphy says, are located in major US metropolitan areas, carrying domestic as well as international traffic.” If these major hubs were “taken out by natural disaster … or a strategic attack, much of the United States, if not much of the world, would have hindered Internet access or none at all, depending on the severity and sophistication of the strike.” Remarkably many I.X.P.s are housed in old, unprotected buildings … Often it’s possible to lease adjacent office space in the buildings. Sometimes there aren’t even security guards in the lobby. And the manholes around the buildings are also unprotected … The Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for critical infrastructure, has no requirements for the physical protection of I.X.P.s nor does it have any rules against ownership by companies affiliated with a hostile foreign state.

Experts interviewed by Murphy point to two different strategies for protecting this infrastructure. One is to increase security at the critical junctures, perhaps even concentrating traffic within those specially protected sites. The other is to disperse the system far more than it is now, so that no single juncture is as critical as now and the system is protected through redundancy. If you create redundancy, says Bill Woodcock of the research institute Packet Clearing House, it “doesn’t matter if it’s in a mop closet.” He refers, Murphy says, to one “heavily trafficked I.X.P. in a former janitor’s closet on an upper floor of an old building.”","The article discusses the vulnerabilities of physical cables critical for telecommunications, including instances of fiber cuts that disrupt internet connectivity.

While it does not specifically mention 'cut sea cables' or 'submarine cables,' it addresses the broader implications of cable cuts on communication, making it relevant to the topic.

Undersea fiber optic cables are the arteries of the Internet. A [story in the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/world/europe/russian-presence-near-undersea-cables-concerns-us.html?_r=0) this week has started a conversation about the vulnerability of these cables and consequently, the Internet itself.

The Times reported that the Pentagon is increasingly concerned about Russian naval activity in proximity to key cables. The suggestion is that the Web could be crippled by Russian attack in the event of a confrontation with the West.

“We depend pretty extensively on these cables,” says Jon Hjembo. “In fact, pretty much everything that we do, all of our communications, eventually traverses fiber optic cables at some point. We talk a lot about the cloud, for example, but really the cloud is under the ocean, it’s under the ground. It’s not something nebulous in the sky. Even our wireless communications — the wireless connection is really a connection between your phone and a base station. From there it traverses fiber optic cables.”

There are about [300 undersea cables around the world](http://submarine-cable-map-2015.telegeography.com/), and they’re only about the width of a garden hose. So they are often broken by anchor cables, trawlers, and undersea disasters like earthquakes and landslides. Even shark bites. Many of the cables converge on certain hubs — like New York, Miami and Los Angeles — making these nodes especially vulnerable.

“There are at least 100 breaks on these systems every year,” says Hjembo. “But the beauty of networks is that there is a lot of built-in redundancy. So usually when a break occurs, we don’t even feel it.”

So any deliberate hostile attempt to sabotage the cable network would have to be pretty widespread to overwhelm all that built-in redundancy. “It would have to be a concerted attack on multiple systems at the same time,” says Hjembo.

That makes Hjembo skeptical about the probability of such a move. “If we saw any kind of movement towards multiple systems at the same time, I’m sure that an interception would occur before anything were to happen.”

He also points out that an attack on the Internet would in some ways be self-defeating, since the attacker would also suffer from the resultant chaos.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, referring to them as ""the arteries of the Internet"" and elaborating on their vulnerability to various threats, including natural disasters and human activities.

Additionally, it discusses the implications of damage to these cables, noting that there are at least 100 breaks in these systems every year.

"Baltic Sea Internet Cables Sabotaged, European Officials Allege Russian Involvement","Disruption of two submarine cables affecting 33% of Lithuania's internet capacity; investigations initiated by Finland and Sweden.","https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/19/europe/sabotage-undersea-cables-cut-baltic-sea-intl/index.html","2024-11-20T12:00:00.000Z","",Yes,"Ivana Kottasová","New York, NY, United States","30000","2024-11-20","English","CNN","CNN —

European officials are looking toward Russia after two submarine internet cables in the Baltic Sea were suddenly disrupted in an apparent sabotage operation, just weeks after the United States warned that Moscow was likely to target critical undersea infrastructure.

A cable between Lithuania and Sweden was cut on Sunday, according to Telia Lithuania, the telecommunications company that runs the link. Separately, the state-controlled Finnish telecoms company Cinia said one of its cables, which connects Finland and Germany, was disrupted on Monday.

The Swedish Prosecution Authority said Tuesday that the country’s National Unit against International and Organized Crime had opened a preliminary investigation into suspected sabotage over the cut cables. Finland’s National Bureau of Investigation also said it had launched an investigation.

While the exact causes of the incidents are still being investigated, Germany’s Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said he believed it was likely sabotage.

”Nobody believes that these cables were accidentally severed,” he told reporters on Tuesday morning ahead of a ministerial meeting in Brussels, Belgium. “We have to know that, without knowing specifically who it came from, that it is a hybrid action and we also have to assume that, without knowing by whom yet, that this is sabotage,“ Pistorius said.

His comments came after the foreign ministers of Finland and Germany said in a joint statement on Monday evening that they were “deeply concerned” about the severed cable between their nations, and raised the possibility of the incident being part of a “hybrid warfare.”

“The fact that such an incident immediately raises suspicions of intentional damage speaks volumes about the volatility of our times. A thorough investigation is underway,” the statement continued. “Our European security is not only under threat from Russia‘s war of aggression against Ukraine, but also from hybrid warfare by malicious actors.”

However, two US officials familiar with an initial assessment told CNN Tuesday that as yet there were “no indications of nefarious activity, nor intentional damage to seafloor infrastructure” and suggested the disruption was likely caused by an anchor dragged from a passing vessel.

Tracking data from Kpler and Spire did not show any ships near the area where the cables are believed to have been cut. All vessels above a certain tonnage are required by international law to have automatic identification systems that allow them to be tracked, and must keep them on at all times.

There are some instances where these might be turned off, and military ships are not required to have it turned on. Vessels that have it turned off are frequently involved in illicit operations such as oil smuggling and illegal fishing.

However, ship tracking data analyzed by CNN shows at least one ship crossing the Lithuania-Sweden cable.

The cutting of the cables on Sunday and Monday fits the pattern of attacks that have been linked to Russia. Additionally, it is no secret that Russia has been showing increased interest in undersea cables in recent months, patrolling close to critical maritime infrastructure often far from its shores.

Two US officials told CNN in September that the United States believed Russia was now more likely to carry out potential sabotage operations.

They said Moscow has been beefing up its dedicated secretive marine unit that deploys fleets of surface ships, submarines and naval drones to survey the seabed.

Known as “GUGI,” the Russian acronym for the “General Staff Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research,” the unit was previously spotted lurking around critical infrastructure.

A joint investigation by the public broadcasters of Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland found in April 2023 that Russia had deployed a fleet of suspected spy ships in Nordic waters as part of a program of potential sabotage of underwater cables and wind farms in the region.

European security officials and experts have been warning for months that Russia was waging a hybrid war against the West – accusations prompted by a series of seemingly random arson attacks, hackings and explosions that occurred across multiple European cities in recent months.

These included arson attacks against a bus garage in the Czech capital of Prague, the Museum of Occupation in Riga, Latvia, a warehouse of a Ukrainian company in London and a shopping center in Warsaw, Poland. Multiple hacking attacks and spying incidents have also been reported in different European countries. As the same time, the European Union has accused Russia and Belarus of weaponizing migration by pushing asylum seekers from third countries to its borders.

Rod Thornton, a senior lecturer in defense studies at King’s College London, said that Moscow has been using sabotage as an alternative to a full-on war with NATO, which would be disastrous for Russia.

Instead, Russia is trying to cause disruption without crossing the threshold that would trigger a forceful response from NATO. The principle that an attack against one member country is an attack against the whole alliance is the cornerstone of the group’s defense pact.

Thornton said it was telling that the disruption happened at the time Russia is trying to increase pressure on Ukraine and the West.

“It could be seen as Russia ramping up the war and the effects of the war in Ukraine before (US President-elect Donald) Trump comes into power to increase the willingness of Western powers to bring an end to the war,” he told CNN in an interview.

“You can see how Trump wants to bring an end to the war, and if the Russians increase pressure on other Western countries and show them the effects of the war, then those Western countries might be more amenable to supporting Trump in his desire to have a ceasefire,” he explained.

Nobody has so far claimed responsibility for the damage. If Russia was behind it, it is unlikely to admit so.

All of the sabotage attacks that have been linked to Russia earlier this year had one thing in common: they were done in a way that allowed Moscow to deny any involvement, usually by low-level operatives or common criminals paid to conduct them.

“This is important because international institutions like the UN can’t blame Russia because the evidence isn’t there. The circumstantial evidence is there, but not the real evidence, there’s no actual kind of smoking gun that can be linked back to them,” Thornton said.

Oleksandr V. Danylyuk, an associate fellow at Royal United Services Institute, a UK defense and security think tank, and a former Ukrainian defense and foreign intelligence official, said this kind of deniability has long been Russia’s strategy.

“The idea is to conduct the operation in the way that everybody understands that it was done by Russia, but at the same time, it leaves some room for the victim to pretend they didn’t know, because the victim is not interested in escalation,” he said, also pointing to the events leading to the annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea by Russia in 2014.

“Those little green men, everybody knew that they were Russian forces, but because the West wasn’t ready, you know, to do anything, they could say ‘oh, it’s not certain, we should check what’s going on, maybe it’s some kind of local militia,’” he said.

The extent of the disruption, if any, caused by the damage to the cables is unclear. Accidents that cause damage to undersea cables are rare, but they do happen, so most providers run services through several different routes to avoid blackouts.

The limited disruption could have been intentional, making the impact serious enough to be seen as an escalation, but not enough to spiral out of control, for now.

“It does take it that that one stage further, but it’s cutting a cable that isn’t going to offend too many countries. They could have gone to the Atlantic and cut a cable there between the US and the UK, or between Europe and the US, which could have major, major consequences, so this is a kind of warning shot,” Thornton said.

Cinia said in a statement that services running through the C-Lion1 cable that connects Helsinki with Rostock were down, but added that Finland’s international telecommunication connections were routed via multiple links.

The company said a repair vessel had been dispatched to the scene and, while it did not yet know how long it would take to fix the issue, added that it typically takes between five and 15 days for submarine cables to be repaired.

Telia Lithuania’s chief technology officer Andrius Šemeškevičius was quoted by Lithuanian media as saying that the cable that was disrupted – BCS East-West – handled roughly a third of Lithuania’s internet capacity. He added that traffic has been restored since the disruption.

CNN’s Stephanie Halasz, Billy Stockwell, Paul P. Murphy and Jim Sciutto contributed reporting.","The article titled 'European officials cry sabotage after two internet cables are cut in the Baltic Sea' from CNN directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables.

""Cutting one or two [submarine cables] is not a big deal, really,"" said Alan Mauldin, director of research at TeleGeography, a Washington telecommunications consulting firm. ""Also bear in mind a lot of content is hosted in the US in massive data centers, so even if all the trans-Atlantic cables were cut, you’d still be able to use Facebook – it might be a bit more challenging for your friends in Europe to like the photos of your baby.""

Still, a network of fiber-optic cables does crisscross the world’s oceans, connecting countries and continents. Each cable is about three inches thick. At its center are several fiber-optic fibers that transmit data as pulses of red light. Submarine cables carry around 99 percent of transoceanic communications, according to Mauldin.

That means 99 percent of telephone and Internet data that crosses an ocean – from Europe to the US, from Canada to Asia, from Iceland or Australia to anywhere else – travels through a thin strand of optical fiber bundled into a cable and laid across the ocean floor.

Dozens of commercial cables cross the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, connecting the Americas to the rest of the world. Their locations are well-known. The telecom market research firm TeleGeography publishes an interactive map every year, and submarine cable locations are also marked on nautical charts. The cables also tend to follow long-established routes dictated by international agreements and undersea conditions.

Thanks to Edward Snowden, we know that the US and Britain tap those cables extensively. The practices date back to at least the 1970s, when a US submarine tapped a military submarine cable off the Russian coast. The US even has a submarine, the USS Jimmy Carter, that reportedly specializes in tapping undersea cables.

Sabotage is also common, according to a recent blog post by Doug Madory, director of Internet Analysis at Dyn, a company that monitors Internet performance. ""Unfortunately, accidental submarine cable cuts, along with acts of telecom sabotage, occur with varying degrees of regularity,"" Mr. Madory wrote. ""In either case, service is generally restored in hours, days or weeks and life carries on.""

The Egyptian Navy caught divers cutting a submarine cable near Alexandria in 2013. A submarine cable off the coast of Gabon, in West Africa, suffered the same fate earlier this year. There was even a string of sabotage to terrestrial fiber optic cables in the Bay Area that drew attention from the FBI.

The biggest danger to submarine cables, however, is also the most mundane: Ship anchors are responsible for the majority of cable breaks. Natural disasters like typhoons and earthquakes can even damage submarine cables. Then there are accidents. In 2011, a 75-year-old woman in Georgia took all of Armenia and parts of Georgia offline when she accidentally clipped a terrestrial fiber-optic cable while scavenging for copper.

Many of those incidents were incredibly disruptive, knocking out bandwidth for entire regions of the globe. But the sheer number of cables connecting the US to the rest of the world means that traffic can easily reroute around minor breaks to trans-Atlantic or trans-Pacific cables, according to Mr. Mauldin.

Major damage to trans-Atlantic cables would be most disruptive to the financial sector, which has grown to depend on quick global communications, according to Madory. The Internet would route around the damage quickly, and some of the difference could be made up with satellite links, Madory wrote.

That was the case when Hurricane Sandy took major networks hubs offline in 2012, according to an analysis of network traffic by Dyn. While the storm took down some websites hosted in flooded Manhattan data centers, the overall effect on global Internet traffic was negligible.

Rerouting traffic and switching to satellites couldn’t replace the lost bandwidth from a major submarine cable sabotage, according to Madory. Still, he agreed with Mauldin that a scenario where someone cuts enough submarine cables to significantly degrade US Internet access seems impractical.

""It would truly take a Hollywood scenario to even temporarily degrade the Internet for a country as richly connected as the United States,"" Madory wrote. ""Short of massive solar flares or some other civilization threatening global calamity, the Internet will continue to function as designed and with only sporadic localized failures.""

Those localized failures can pose major problems, especially in an emergency. The US government also has its own secret submarine cables that carry military data, according to the Times. Russia could be searching for their location, the Times said, citing unnamed US officials. Those classified cables could be at greater risk than commercial cables if there are fewer of them because there would be fewer alternate routers if one or more are sabotaged.

But for now, experts say, the public Internet is safe.","The article discusses the risks associated with undersea cables, including direct mentions of 'undersea cables' and 'submarine cables'.

Strange though it may seem, the world is strung together like a gigantic submarine zither. Optical fiber pipes—the plucked strings of the Internet—carry our music, our chatter, our data across the globe.

One can understand why American defense officials might be worried then, that a Russian spy ship has been snooping around these wired routes. As a _New York Times_ article earlier this week suggested, one cannot rule out the possibility of a devastating attack against these vital lines—""the ultimate Russian hack on the United States,"" if you will. The Pentagon, for one, has certainly contemplated such a doomsday event.

Should the rest of us be concerned? I asked Doug Madory, director of Internet analysis at Dyn, which keeps close tabs on the performance of Internet infrastructure, for his thoughts. He maintains that these networks—though they suffer cable breaks somewhat regularly (especially in shallow, anchor-prone waters)—are phenomenally resilient. A concerted attack, however, might pose a bigger problem.

""If someone did sever cables in the most extreme Hollywood scenario,"" he said, ""any kind of international commerce or communications could be severely impacted."" Still the greatest impact, he suggested, might be psychological.

""It does sound a little James Bond,"" he added. ""But I guess that’s what the Navy is paid to defend against.""

Such telecom attacks have a precedent—if not yet at the scale imagined by the _Times_. A spate of mysterious cable cuts hit California this year. Saboteurs in Gabon recently sliced submarine wires amid a labor dispute. And the Egyptian Navy arrested divers who damaged undersea lines with explosives while apparently scavenging for scrap metal in 2013. Madory describes these events and others in a blog post of his own here.

I mulled these incidents and incursions while visiting AT&T’s global network operations center earlier this week. (More on that to come.) There I had a birds-eye view of the company’s webwork of wired and wireless links—as well as a squid’s-eye view of its undersea cable system. That submarine network appeared on screen as a tangled ball of seaweed, shaded an algal green.

""I swear I didn’t set that up,"" the tour guide told me, grinning as he motioned toward the display. There was not a jot of red to be found. (Green means “good” connection; red means “problem.”) At least for now, I presume, the network must be doing okay.

So there’s your Oct. 31, technologic apocalypse scenario. Happy Halloween, dear readers.

"Huawei's Strategic Role in Submarine Cable Infrastructure","Explores Huawei's involvement in submarine cables, raising security concerns for international communications and espionage implications.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/13/huawei-is-better-positioned-spy-us-than-we-think","2019-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","Jack Hasler",Yes,"Jack Hasler","Washington, D.C., United States",-,"2019-03-13","English","Washington Post","The United States and its allies are arguing over whether governments should use telecommunications equipment manufactured by Huawei. In March 2018, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai proposed banning local communities from using the FCC’s Universal Service Fund to buy equipment from Huawei. In 2012, a House Intelligence Committee report argued in favor of barring Huawei from any U.S. mergers or acquisitions, arguing that it was an arm of the Chinese government and a threat to national security. The Trump administration is trying to persuade its allies to block Huawei from contracts to build 5G wireless networks, arguing that Huawei equipment might have built-in back doors that would allow the Chinese government to monitor others’ communications. Some allies are following the United States’ lead; others, including close allies such as Britain, are resisting.

However, 5G is not the only important communications network. In other parts of the world such as Latin America and Africa, Huawei is laying the submarine cables that carry most long-distance communications traffic. Other countries are more willing to work with Huawei because they know that the United States, too, has tapped into global cable networks.

Huawei is building big parts of the world cable network.

On Sept. 4, the South Atlantic Inter Link (or SAIL, for short) went live, connecting Fortaleza, Brazil, to Kribi, Cameroon. This international submarine cable, which was buried just below the sea floor across the entire South Atlantic, is a new link in a network of cables that connect the globe and carry more than 95 percent of international communications traffic. SAIL was constructed by Huawei Marine and funded through a partnership with China Unicom, a state-owned Chinese telecommunications company.

Before SAIL went live, the only cable connecting South America with a continent other than North America was a semi-obsolete cable to Portugal laid in the late 1990s. In September, the South Atlantic Cable System (SACS), funded by Angolan firms and constructed by the Japanese company NEC, also entered service between Brazil and Africa. Three more cables are planned to connect Brazil directly to Spain, Angola and South Africa.

In the past, firms from the United States and Europe initiated and built such projects. But companies like Huawei are increasing their share of the international network. In addition to new connections in and around China, Huawei Marine has been laying cables and updating old systems on both coasts of Africa, throughout Latin America and in the Mediterranean.

For instance, in 2015, Huawei upgraded the West Africa Cable System (WACS), which runs along the entire western coast of Europe and Africa from Britain to South Africa. In 2012, it did the same for MedNautilus in the Mediterranean. Huawei is currently constructing the Pakistan and East Africa Connecting Europe (PEACE) cable, which will connect the three continents sometime after 2020.

This Huawei expansion concerns some U.S. allies. In 2017, Australia raised red flags over a proposed international cable project between Sydney and the Solomon Islands to its north, explicitly citing security concerns over Huawei’s involvement. The Australian government then funded the $78 million project itself.

The response is more equivocal than the United States would like — because other countries don’t trust the United States, either.

International cables give governments an enormous opportunity to collect information from other governments, businesses and private citizens alike — because all communications must flow through them. In the 1970s, the United States began Operation Ivy Bells to spy on submarine cables laid by the Soviet Union. Examples of such espionage date back at least as far as World War I, with Britain intercepting German communications.

However, some countries are as worried about U.S. surveillance as they are about Chinese threats. In 2013, Edward Snowden revealed that the National Security Agency was collecting international communications traffic traveling through the United States using these cables. The leak suggested that it was risky for other countries to have cables built by U.S. firms that almost exclusively went through the United States.

After the leak, South American governments, especially Brazil’s, became increasingly concerned about depending on the United States to communicate with the rest of the world. In a 2014 address to the European Union, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff argued: “We have to respect privacy, human rights and the sovereignty of nations. We don’t want businesses to be spied upon.”

Five years later, Brazil and others are accomplishing this goal by splitting up their international connections among firms based in a variety of countries. While Chinese firms are working on SAIL, other connections are being built by companies such as France’s Alcatel. No two new cables are being built to the same country.

European and North American governments are worried that China might spy on their telecommunications traffic through imported technologies. But the Chinese-built submarine cables mean that international transmissions are already at risk and likely to become more vulnerable in the years ahead.

By taking advantage of the opportunity to tap into the world’s communications network, the U.S. government has damaged its ability to counter the expansion of Chinese and non-U.S. firms. Its current efforts to constrain Huawei and other Chinese firms in Europe do not address other countries’ lack of confidence in the proposed American alternatives.

Now, Huawei is officially bowing out of one line of business, by agreeing to sell off its undersea cable operations, and reportedly shrinking another, by reducing smartphone production orders with supplier Foxconn.

Huawei Marine Systems, in which Huawei holds a 51 percent stake, lays undersea fiber optic cables between continents in much the same way that Microsoft, Facebook, and Google have been doing. It was established in 2009 and has laid more than 50,000km of cable across 90 projects, according to its website. In recent times, however, the toxicity of Huawei’s reputation as an alleged Chinese spying facilitator has made it increasingly difficult for Huawei Marine Systems to win contracts, as the FT reports. That reports cites Fergus Hanson from the International Cyber Policy Centre at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, who says “It’s becoming a more difficult environment when trying to negotiate deals to build cables because [Huawei] is so much in the spotlight.”

Hengtong Optic-Electric, another Chinese company, is buying Huawei’s share of the submarine cable operation, and it made the planned sale official in a filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The price of the transaction has not been publicized.

In other Huawei news, a report from the South China Morning Post indicates that Foxconn, leading production and assembly partner to many smartphone makers, “has stopped several production lines for Huawei phones in recent days as the Shenzhen company reduced orders for new phones.” This appears to be a direct response to Huawei’s placement on the Trump blacklist, which deprived the company of its Android license, effectively neutering Huawei’s European Android smartphone business until further notice.

The SCMP goes on to report that Foxconn had apparently been hiring new staff earlier in the year to help it cope with Huawei’s growing demand, and Huawei was indeed on a path to becoming the world’s biggest smartphone vendor by the end of 2019. Reaching that goal has now been substantially delayed by the US ban setback and may even become impossible, depending on how long Huawei’s enforced estrangement from Google and other US partners continues.","The article titled 'Huawei is selling off its undersea cable business' discusses Huawei's operations in the undersea cable sector, including the sale of its undersea cable business and the implications of this decision.

Simply put, there are hundreds of underwater cables that have been put at the bottom of the ocean to transmit data internationally.

### It's Not Magic
There is something so simple and yet so grand about this that I love. No, it's not satellites (well, there are some satellites...) or magic, it's simply a bunch of physical cables we installed.

### Submarine Cables
There are currently around 378 underwater cables, over 1.2 million kilometers of cable total, that connect most of the world to the Internet.

TeleGeography offers an interactive [Submarine Cable Map](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/), which shows the overall map of cables and gives you info like that particular cable length, who owns it, and its landing points. I highly recommend checking it out.

### What Are The Cables Made Of?
At their core, these cables use fiber-optics to send light signals, with lasers that shoot from one end to another at an extreme rate. The actual glass fibers that do this are very small, they have a similar diameter to a piece of hair, but they are covered with several layers of protection.

Still, the majority of the cable at the bottom of the ocean is only about the size of a garden hose. The layers of protection are increased in more shallow areas since there’s a greater chance of coming into contact with ships, etc. They’re also buried when close to shore for another layer of protection. However, out in the deep sea areas, the cables are laid directly on the ocean floor using a special machine.

### Where Are The Cables Installed?
Precautions are taken to find the safest path for the cables to avoid areas where there’s a lot of fishing or where boats may be anchoring. It’s these types of human activities that cause the most damage to the cables. Although there are about 100 cable faults each year, you would probably never notice because companies use redundant cables so there’s always backup.

Also, the cables are laid based on which locations have something to communicate with each other. So, you can see there are not a lot of direct lines between Australia and South America, but instead, they both have many cables linking to North America. This is suggesting that they both have a need to send and receive info from North America.

### Fast Facts
Here are some additional facts, in case you’re as fascinated with these cables as I am:
- The first oceanic cables ever installed were telegraphic lines laid across the Atlantic Ocean in 1866.
- It only takes one boat to carry all the cable needed for these transcontinental connections.
- Every 50 miles under the ocean there are blocks called repeaters that help amplify the light so it can travel all the thousands of miles.
- In 2013 three scuba divers were caught trying to cut an undersea Internet cable in the Mediterranean, which slowed down the Internet for about a week.
- While sharks are known to occasionally bite the cables, they are not seen as a major threat to the Internet. Human activity accounts for about 2/3 of damages to the cables.

When did you learn that the world was connected via underwater cables? Am I the last to learn this? I'd love to hear any feedback or additional facts you have about our underwater system!

Undersea fiber optic cables are the arteries of the Internet. A story in the New York Times this week has started a conversation about the vulnerability of these cables and consequently, the Internet itself.  
The Times reported that the Pentagon is increasingly concerned about Russian naval activity in proximity to key cables. The suggestion is that the Web could be crippled by Russian attack in the event of a confrontation with the West.  
“We depend pretty extensively on these cables,” says Jon Hjembo. “In fact, pretty much everything that we do, all of our communications, eventually traverses fiber optic cables at some point. We talk a lot about the cloud, for example, but really the cloud is under the ocean, it’s under the ground. It’s not something nebulous in the sky. Even our wireless communications — the wireless connection is really a connection between your phone and a base station. From there it traverses fiber optic cables.”  
There are about 300 undersea cables around the world, and they’re only about the width of a garden hose. So they are often broken by anchor cables, trawlers, and undersea disasters like earthquakes and landslides. Even shark bites. Many of the cables converge on certain hubs — like New York, Miami and Los Angeles — making these nodes especially vulnerable.  
“There are at least 100 breaks on these systems every year,” says Hjembo. “But the beauty of networks is that there is a lot of built-in redundancy. So usually when a break occurs, we don’t even feel it.”  
So any deliberate hostile attempt to sabotage the cable network would have to be pretty widespread to overwhelm all that built-in redundancy. “It would have to be a concerted attack on multiple systems at the same time,” says Hjembo.  
That makes Hjembo skeptical about the probability of such a move. “If we saw any kind of movement towards multiple systems at the same time, I’m sure that an interception would occur before anything were to happen.”  
He also points out that an attack on the Internet would in some ways be self-defeating, since the attacker would also suffer from the resultant chaos.","The article discusses the vulnerabilities of undersea fiber optic cables, directly addressing the topic of cut sea cables.

Here was a presidential candidate from a major U.S. party encouraging a foreign government to target American interests with cyberspying — an act that could not only expose national security information but also potentially undermine the actual security infrastructure of the United States.  

Cyberwarriors working for Moscow and other regimes are already poking and prodding at our networks, so there's little reason to think Trump's words were all that damaging in themselves. But it's a good opportunity to talk about the state of state-sponsored hacking, and to offer a reminder that the United States is just as active in this space as the next government.  

The U.S. approach to this digital battleground is pretty advanced. For example: Did you know that the military uses its submarines as underwater hacking platforms?  

In fact, subs represent an important component of America's cyber strategy. They act defensively to protect themselves and the country from digital attack, but — more interestingly — they also have a role to play in carrying out cyberattacks, according to two U.S. Navy officials at a [recent Washington conference](https://www.csis.org/events/delivering-future-submarine-warfare).  

""There is a — an offensive capability that we are, that we prize very highly,"" said Rear Adm. Michael Jabaley, the U.S. Navy's program executive officer for submarines. ""And this is where I really can't talk about much, but suffice to say we have submarines out there on the front lines that are very involved, at the highest technical level, doing exactly the kind of things that you would want them to do.""  

The so-called ""silent service"" has a long history of using information technology to gain an edge on America's rivals. In the 1970s, the U.S. government [instructed its submarines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ivy_Bells) to tap undersea communications cables off the Russian coast, recording the messages being relayed back and forth between Soviet forces. (The National Security Agency has [continued that tradition](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/the-nsa-slide-you-havent-seen/2013/07/10/32801426-e8e6-11e2-aa9f-c03a72e2d342_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_11), monitoring underwater fiber cables as part of its globe-spanning intelligence-gathering apparatus. In some cases, the government has struck [closed-door deals](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/agreements-with-private-companies-protect-us-access-to-cables-data-for-surveillance/2013/07/06/aa5d017a-df77-11e2-b2d4-ea6d8f477a01_story.html?tid=a_inl&itid=lk_inline_manual_11) with the cable operators ensuring that U.S. spies can gain secure access to the information traveling over those pipes.)  

These days, some U.S. subs come equipped with sophisticated antennas that can be used to intercept and manipulate other people's communications traffic, particularly on weak or unencrypted networks.  

""We've gone where our targets have gone"" — that is to say, online, said Stewart Baker, the National Security Agency's former general counsel, in an interview. ""Only the most security-conscious now are completely cut off from the Internet."" Cyberattacks are also much easier to carry out than to defend against, he said.  

One of America's premier hacker subs, the USS Annapolis, is hooked into a much wider U.S. spying net that was disclosed as part of the 2013 Edward Snowden leaks, according to Adam Weinstein and William Arkin, writing last year for Gawker's intelligence and national security blog, [Phase Zero](http://phasezero.gawker.com/spying-on-the-u-s-submarine-that-spies-for-the-nsa-and-1693109418). A leaked slide showed that in a typical week, the Navy performs hundreds of so-called ""computer network exploitations,"" many of which are likely the result of submarine-based hacking.  

""Annapolis and its sisters are the infiltrators of the new _new_ of cyber warfare,"" wrote Arkin and Weinstein, ""getting close to whatever enemy — inside their defensive zones — to jam and emit and spoof and hack. They do this through mast-mounted antennas and collection systems atop the conning tower, some of them one-of-a-kind devices made for hard to reach or specific targets, all of them black boxes of future war.""  

But even this doesn't compare to what the Navy wants to be able to do next: turn its submarines into motherships for underwater drones that can maneuver themselves even closer to shore and conduct jamming or hacking operations while allowing the sub to work at a distance.  

""We want the boat to grow longer arms,"" said Rear Adm. Charles Richard, director of the Navy's undersea warfare division. ""We are at all-ahead flank [speed], both on unmanned aerial and undersea vehicles.""  

It's unclear how far behind — or ahead — other navies may be when it comes to submarine-based cyber offense. Many of the cybersecurity and military experts we interviewed for this story had hardly heard of the Defense Department's own undersea cyber capabilities.  

But, Baker said, ""espionage is a game where there's a lot of following the leader — so it's perfectly possible it's happening in this field as well.""  

What is clear is that the U.S. military operates some of the most sophisticated information networks ever designed, and it's using them to penetrate foreign computer systems as part of an evolving cyber strategy.  

We may never know precisely what dirt the Pentagon is digging up with its submarine espionage, or be able to draw a link between it and any political or military events in the real world. But despite the rising prominence of Russian hackers in this news cycle — and Chinese hackers before that — it's worth pointing out that the United States has grown fairly proficient in cyberspace, too.","The article discusses the role of U.S. submarines in cyber warfare, particularly their capabilities to intercept and tap undersea communications cables.

It mentions that the U.S. government instructed submarines to tap these cables off the Russian coast in the 1970s and that the NSA continues to monitor underwater fiber cables for intelligence purposes.

This indicates a significant focus on the implications of undersea cables in the context of national security and cyber operations, fulfilling the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables.

In submarine cables particular care has always to be exercised in dealing with the joints, and every endeavour is made to limit their number by manufacturing individual cable lengths as long as possible, consistent with the methods of transport, storage accommodation, etc., available, and the scheme of laying to be adopted. With submarine cable-laying under normal conditions, it is unlikely that more than one sea joint will be necessary, the cable being laid in two parts, one section from each shore termination. This necessitates cutting the cable at a convenient position, buoying the end, and picking up again after the other section has been laid. The joint is then made on the ship and on completion is cast overboard, after due precautions have been taken. The article refers to both communication cables and power cables, the latter for voltages, for example, up to 33 kV. In the section on communication cables the authors discuss gutta-percha joints, splicing the sheathing wires, rubber joints, rubber to gutta-percha joints, and paper joints. The section on power cables is confined to those of the impregnated paper-insulated and lead-covered types and describes the making of subaqueous joints, super-tension joints and the handling of the shore ends of the cable. The article is illustrated and several photographs are included showing different stages in the operations of laying submarine cables.","The article 'Joints in Submarine Cables' directly discusses the technical process of laying submarine cables, including the necessity of cutting cables at convenient positions for making joints.

This indicates a significant focus on the topic of cut sea cables, as it elaborates on the implications of cutting cables during the installation process.

The content goes beyond a minor mention and treats the cutting of cables as an integral part of the discussion on submarine cable installation and maintenance."

**July 18, 2013**  

Documents published last week by the Australian website revealed that the U.S. government compelled Telstra and Hong Kong-based PCCW to give it access to their undersea cables for spying on communications traffic entering and leaving the U.S.. The significance of the disclosure is obvious; today, more than 99 percent of the world's internet and telephone traffic is now carried by undersea fiber optic cables.  

Since the late 1960s as part of its ECHELON spy project, the United States has been tapping undersea cables to extract communications and signals intelligence. Projects such as Operation Ivy Bells, a joint Navy-NSA secret intelligence program directed against the former Soviet Union, were designed to do just that.  

A year later, AT&T whistleblower Mark Klein told Wired Magazine that NSA was tapping directly into the world's internet backbone from domestic listening posts the telecommunications giant jointly built with the agency at corporate switching stations.  

Whatever submarine operations NSA still carry out with the U.S. Navy and ""Five Eyes"" surveillance partners, access to information flowing through undersea cables means that the U.S. government is well-positioned to scoop up virtually all global communications.  

Reporting by Australian journalists confirm information published by The Washington Post. Overseas submarine cable companies doing business in the United States must maintain an internal corporate cell of American citizens with government clearances, to ensure that when U.S. government agencies seek access to the data flowing through their networks, they have systems in place to provide it securely.  

It is known that the Australian secret state agency, the Defence Security Directorate (DSD), is a key participant in U.S. global surveillance projects.  

The paper also reported that a new state-of-the-art data storage facility at HMAS Harman to support the Australian signals directorate and other Australian intelligence agencies is currently under construction.  

Such sensitive data can also be used to undermine the position of their foreign competitors. We now know, based on documents provided by Snowden, that the infiltration of computer networks by U.S. secret state agencies is useful not only for military secrets and mass spying but also for economic and industrial espionage.  

At the time the Telstra pact was signed, the Australian telecommunications and internet giant was ""50.1% owned"" by the Australian government.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, focusing on their role in global communications and U.S. government surveillance.

It mentions the access granted to these cables for spying, the historical context of such surveillance, and the implications for internet connectivity.

Terms like 'undersea cables' and 'submarine cables' are used throughout, confirming that the article treats this subject as a central theme rather than a minor mention.

When we talk about modern tech warfare, we’re usually focused on nuclear reactors, water pumps, or transportation systems. We might think of the super-virus deployed by the United States and Israel to slow down Iran’s nuclear program in 2010. We don’t typically consider the miles of undersea cables that, according to the US Federal Reserve, carry $10 trillion in transactions every day.

Now, the US government is concerned the Russian military could attempt to sabotage these cables in a time of conflict, according to the New York Times. The newspaper reported an uptick of activity by Russian submarines near several major cables.

Although internet cables close to shore tend to be bulky and well-armored, those that run along the deep sea are often much thinner, according to Nicole Starosielski, a communications professor at New York University and author of The Undersea Network. These cables, like the one we’ve illustrated above, are just a centimeter or two in diameter and protected only by an outer layer of insulation.

Cables are generally safest out in the deep sea, but it’s not uncommon for them to be accidentally damaged by fishing operations. “An undersea grapnel could easily cut a cable, as can an anchor,” Starosielski wrote in an email. “It happens all the time.”

“It wouldn’t be much trouble at all” for the Russian military to deliberately sabotage such a cable, Starosielski said.

Damage to cables that are close to shore can be fixed fairly quickly. Not so for broken lines in the middle of the ocean. ”Since ships have to cross the ocean before getting to the line, this unavoidably takes time,” Starosielski said.

Still, undersea cable damage and repair is a regular practice, and most internet traffic to and from the US can travel over multiple routes, avoiding any cables that have been disabled. There would have to be a very specific moment within a very specific conflict for Russia to cut an internet cable and expect it to have a major impact.","The article discusses underwater internet cables, specifically their vulnerability to damage and potential sabotage, particularly in the context of military actions.

It mentions 'undersea cables' directly and explains the implications of damage to these cables on internet connectivity.

The article treats the topic as a central theme, detailing concerns about military threats and the challenges of repairing damaged cables.

"Russian Ships Threaten Global Internet Connectivity","Explores the risk of Russian naval forces targeting undersea cables, potentially leading to lengthy repair times and significant disruptions to global internet access.","https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/216941-russian-ships-may-be-preparing-to-attack-the-global-internet","2015-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","",Yes,-,"New York, New York, United States",-,"2015-10-27","English","ExtremeTech","US government sources have revealed growing concerns that Russian naval vessels may be threatening the global internet infrastructure. Russian ships have been seen tracing out the routes of the trans-oceanic cables that carry the vast majority of the world's internet traffic. Russian ships seem to be deliberately staying close enough to these cables to use their attached submersibles, which the US says could descend and sever the lines -- or perhaps tap them.

The issue stems from the fact that these ships seem to be threatening these deep-sea cables in the deep sea, as opposed to near shore where the vast majority of natural or accidental damage occurs. A piece of the internet backbone, severed miles undersea, could potentially take weeks or months to find and repair. Analysts did say that the ships could be trying to find the location of secret cables laid down, mostly the US, for military or other private uses.

On the other hand, take this piece of news in concert with another one from earlier in the month: Russia is running tests on the feasibility of cutting itself off from the global internet. In other words, Russia may be actively researching whether it can maintain certain modern abilities with a Russian-bloc intranet and only semi-permeable junctions of interaction with the outside world. With ships now seemingly looking into the possibility of creating such a reality, it's a troubling situation.

If this is indeed anything more than saber rattling, it could be intended to function in one or both of two ways: as a long-term cultural tactic, or as a short-term military one.

Vladimir Putin could be looking into the possibility of re-creating some version of the Iron Curtain to cut his people off from outside influences. The problem with that plan, of course, is that in the modern world, connection is synonymous with success. At the extreme end of the path of censorship is North Korea, a country where radio transceivers come welded so they can only receive the government channel.

On the other hand, you can be sure there are some American generals getting quite antsy at the prospect of a much more aggressive severing of the cables. Whether a purely malicious move meant to sow economic chaos, or a strategic prelude to some more direct military action, shutting down the global internet could be an incredibly powerful move. Just the possibility of such an attack might push the US and others to start looking longing to some recently proposed plans for global satellite internet.

It's worth noting, though, that just running the ships along a certain route has made the US Navy sit up and take notice, and it's once again put Russia in the driver's seat in international affairs.","The article discusses Russian naval activities near undersea cables, highlighting the potential threat to these cables and their importance for global internet connectivity.

It mentions the possibility of Russian submersibles severing the cables and the lengthy repair times that would ensue.

The central theme focuses on the implications of these threats, making it highly relevant to the topic of cut sea cables."

But Moscow’s willingness to cut off civilian populations from the Internet — a tactic it has already used against regional political threats — may be cause for alarm.

The Times article quoted U.S. and European military and intelligence officials as saying they have observed a 50 percent increase in Russian naval patrols over the past year, including along critical points of the global Internet infrastructure — thousands of miles of fiber-optic cables, often sunk in hard-to-monitor depths of the ocean. Officials, speaking anonymously, told the Times that the increased submarine and spy ship activity has exacerbated concerns about underwater infrastructure being vulnerable to attack in the event of some future international conflict.

It would be “the ultimate Russian hack on the United States,” the officials said, halting “the instant communications on which the West’s governments, economies and citizens have grown dependent.”

Experts say the threat of such a far-reaching cut remains largely hypothetical, however. There have been cases where a country's sole access point was damaged — by a ship's anchor, for instance — but critical data infrastructure in the U.S. is designed to be highly resilient, with dozens of different pipelines and access points on its shores. In a globalized economy, it would also be difficult to target just one country; deliberately cutting off connectivity to a big financial center like the U.S. would send shockwaves across the globe.

Still, Russia watchers say Moscow has been testing its ability to disrupt Internet infrastructure on a more localized scale as part of its wider military spending spree since oil revenues spiked in 2007. “Yes, there is a program by Russians to do this,"" said Keir Giles, an expert on Eurasian security and director of the Conflict Studies Research Centre at the Chatham House think tank in London. “And yes, it has been intensified over the last decade along with every other Russian military activity.”

The most credible fear, at least for the U.S., is that Russia might try to interfere with the secret cables that carry classified data about American military and intelligence work across the globe, Giles said. Unlike most other undersea data cables, these are not mapped. That is why some officials suspect the recent Russian submarine exploration may be aimed, in part, at gathering intelligence on where these pipelines run. Many countries, including the U.S. and Russia, are capable of tapping these cables to steal information, but cutting them would go a step further. It could even force the U.S. to revert to less-secure channels of communication, potentially undermining the intelligence-sharing apparatus.

But for now, the greater vulnerability lies far from U.S. shores. In both Crimea and the Baltic Sea, Russia has tried to disrupt undersea cables at weak points in the infrastructure, according to an excerpt from a forthcoming Chatham House paper, “Russia's New Tools For Confronting The West.” Last year, Russian special forces “selectively disrupted cable connections” at Crimea’s Simferopol Internet exchange point — the only point of access on the peninsula — to shut residents off from anti-Russian media and other sources of politically sensitive information. Coupled with the ban on pro-Ukrainian television programming, the result was Russia’s “total information dominance of the region.”

While countries scale up their cyber-defenses, fearful that viruses and malware pose a growing threat to national security, the underwater cables that carry nearly all global Internet communications remain largely unprotected. In cases like Crimea, where a state can gain physical access to this infrastructure, “you don’t necessarily need sophisticated technology or a Stuxnet,” Giles said, referring to the cyber worm, allegedly created by U.S. and Israel, that struck Iran in 2010. “You just need a few guys with bolt cutters to open the door and a few guys with expertise to cut the cables. Hence the need for civilian infrastructure to be better protected.","The article titled 'Could Russia really cut the Internet?' directly discusses the potential for Russia to cut undersea data cables, describing it as a tactic that could cause significant damage to military and commercial interests.

It highlights increased Russian naval patrols near critical points of global internet infrastructure, emphasizing concerns about the vulnerability of underwater cables to attack.

The article cites experts who confirm that Russia has tested its ability to disrupt internet infrastructure, particularly in regions like Crimea, where cable connections were disrupted to control information flow.

The discussions on the implications of cutting these cables and the historical context provided indicate that the topic is central rather than a minor mention.

Therefore, the article satisfies the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables."

This article was originally published at [The Conversation.](http://theconversation.com/) The publication contributed the article to Live Science's [Expert Voices: Op-Ed & Insights.](https://www.livescience.com/tag/expert-voices-op-ed-and-insights)

Recently a [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/world/europe/russian-presence-near-undersea-cables-concerns-us.html) on Russian submarine activity near undersea communications cables dredged up Cold War politics and generated widespread recognition of the submerged systems we all depend upon.

Not many people realize that undersea cables transport nearly [100% of transoceanic data traffic](https://books.google.com/books?id=LQDXAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA362&dq=submarine+telecommunications+cables&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBGoVChMI5Pm8_oPyyAIVBG4-Ch379Al9#v=onepage&q=99&f=false). These lines are laid on the very bottom of the ocean floor. They’re about as thick as a garden hose and carry the world’s internet, phone calls and even TV transmissions between continents at the speed of light. A single cable can carry tens of terabits of information per second.

While researching my book [The Undersea Network](https://www.dukeupress.edu/The-Undersea-Network), I realized that the cables we all rely on to send everything from email to banking information across the seas remain largely unregulated and undefended. Although they are laid by only a few companies (including the American company SubCom and the French company Alcatel-Lucent) and often funneled along narrow paths, the ocean’s vastness has often provided them protection.

**Far from wireless**

The fact that we route internet traffic through the ocean – amidst deep sea creatures and hydrothermal vents – runs counter to most people’s imaginings of the internet. Didn’t we develop satellites and Wi-Fi to transmit signals through the air? Haven’t we moved to the cloud? Undersea cable systems sound like a thing of the past.

The reality is that the cloud is actually under the ocean. Even though they might seem behind the times, fiber-optic cables are actually state-of-the-art global communications technologies. Since they use light to encode information and remain unfettered by weather, cables carry data faster and cheaper than satellites. They crisscross the continents too – a message from New York to California also travels by fiber-optic cable. These systems are not going to be replaced by aerial communications anytime soon.

**A vulnerable system?**

The biggest problem with cable systems is not technological – it’s human. Because they run underground, underwater and between telephone poles, cable systems populate the same spaces we do. As a result, we accidentally break them all the time. Local construction projects dig up terrestrial lines. Boaters drop anchors on cables. And submarines can pinpoint systems under the sea.

Most of the recent media coverage has been dominated by the question of vulnerability. Are global communications networks really at risk of disruption? What would happen if these cables were cut? Do we need to worry about the threat of sabotage from Russian subs or terrorist agents?

The answer to this is not black and white. Any individual cable is always at risk, but likely far more so from boaters and fishermen than any saboteur. Over history, the single largest cause of disruption has been people [unintentionally dropping anchors and nets](https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid=1&doctype=cite&docid=35+Tul.+Mar.+L.+J.+103&srctype=smi&srcid=3B15&key=643357ed57ae3d616915cb7b77c245f4). The [International Cable Protection Committee](https://www.iscpc.org) has been working for years to prevent such breaks.

As a result, cables today are covered in steel armor and buried beneath the seafloor at their shore-ends, where the human threat is most concentrated. This provides some level of protection. In the deep sea, the ocean’s inaccessibility largely safeguards cables – they need only to be covered with a thin polyethelene sheath. It’s not that it’s much more difficult to sever cables in the deep ocean, it’s just that the primary forms of interference are less likely to happen. The sea is so big and the cables are so narrow, the probability isn’t that high that you’d run across one.

Sabotage has actually been rare in the history of undersea cables. There are certainly occurrences (though none recently), but these are disproportionately publicized. The World War I [German raid of the Fanning Island cable station in the Pacific Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanning_Raid) gets a lot of attention. And there was [speculation about sabotage](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&xcust=livescience_us_5958830107782270067&xs=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.economist.com%2Fnode%2F10653963&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2F52685-are-the-internets-undersea-cables-at-risk-for-sabotage.html) in the cable disruptions outside Alexandria, Egypt in 2008, which cut 70% of the country’s internet, affecting millions. Yet we hear little about the regular faults that occur, on average, [about 200 times each year](https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid=1&doctype=cite&docid=35+Tul.+Mar.+L.+J.+103&srctype=smi&srcid=3B15&key=643357ed57ae3d616915cb7b77c245f4).

**Redundancy provides some protection**

The fact is it’s incredibly difficult to monitor these lines. Cable companies have been trying to do so for more than a century, since the first telegraph lines were laid in the 1800s. But the ocean is too vast and the lines simply too long. It would be impossible to stop every vessel that came anywhere near critical communications cables. We’d need to create extremely long, “no-go” zones across the ocean, which itself would profoundly disrupt the economy.

[Fewer than 300 cable systems](http://submarinecablemap.com) transport almost all transoceanic traffic around the world. And these often run through narrow pressure points where small disruptions can have massive impacts. Since each cable can carry an extraordinary amount of information, it’s not uncommon for an entire country to rely on only a handful of systems. In many places, it would take only a few cable cuts to take out large swathes of the internet. If the right cables were disrupted at the right time, it could disrupt global internet traffic for weeks or even months.

The thing that protects global information traffic is the fact that there’s some redundancy built into the system. Since there is more cable capacity than there is traffic, when there is a break, information is automatically rerouted along other cables. Because there are many systems linking to the United States, and a lot of internet infrastructure is located here, a single cable outage is unlikely to cause any noticeable effect for Americans.

Any single cable line has been and will continue to be susceptible to disruption. And the only way around this is to build a more diverse system. But as things are, even though individual companies each look out for their own network, there is no economic incentive or supervisory body to ensure the global system as a whole is resilient. If there’s a vulnerability to worry about, this is it.

Granted the distance that Russian submarines are maintaining, authorities in the US are worried that the global communication lines will be tapped into or severed in case conflict arises.

The US government has grown wary about Russia's increased naval activity near undersea fiber optic cables, which serve as highways for most of the instant communication and data services that citizens within the West have been dependent on. The danger that the current situation presents goes beyond that of the Cold War between the now dissolved Soviet Union and NATO along with its allies.

Moreover, given that the underwater cables carry 95 percent of daily global communications and commerce, having them cut in hard-to-access areas means paralyzing almost the whole world for a significant amount of time before it can be repaired.

""It would be a concern to hear any country was tampering with communication cables,"" said Navy spokesperson Cmdr. William Marks.

According to a Sunday report by the publication, there is yet to be evidence of the cables being cut or tampered with. Nonetheless, the whole situation causes the US to be suspicious and question Russia's increased military presence and activity throughout the globe.

""I'm worried every day about what the Russians may be doing,"" Rear Adm. Frederick J. Roegge said.

The New York Times also alleges that Russia's increased naval activity follow the known paths of the undersea cables, which are the veins of global commerce and electronics.

Furthermore, Yantar, a spy ship from Russia, which is rumored to be equipped with deep-water submersible crafts, was spotted as it travelled towards Cuba. Note that another underwater cable runs along the Cuban seas.

""The risk here is that any country could cause damage to the system and do it in a way that is completely covert, without having a warship with a cable-cutting equipment right in the area,"" Michael Sechrist, who used to be a manager for a project that the Department of Defense funded, explained.","The article discusses the proximity of Russian submarines to critical underwater cables, emphasizing concerns about potential tampering or severing of these cables.

"A New Cold War Deep Under the Sea?","Explores the critical role of undersea cables in global communications amid rising military threats, emphasizing the need for their protection against potential disruptions.","https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-cold-war-under-the-sea_b_8402020","2015-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","Admiral Jim Stavridis (Ret.)",Yes,"Admiral Jim Stavridis (Ret.)","New York City, U.S.",-,"2015-10-28","English","HuffPost","Virtually all of the world's information moves deep under the sea. Well over 95 percent of everything moving on the global Internet passes through 200 or so highly active cables, some as deep under water as Mount Everest is tall. On a normal day, that information is safe and sound, humming along the protected fiber optic strands upon which moves the information that is the backbone of the world's economy.

But recent reports by a variety of sources indicate renewed interest by Russian submarine forces in surveillance of those cables, including detailed monitoring and targeting of the system. The tactical reasons for doing so are plain: in the case of heightened tensions, access to the underwater cable system represents a rich trove of intelligence, a potential major disruption to an enemy's economy and a symbolic chest thump for the Russian Navy.

Placing the submarine activity in the larger context of Russian geopolitical strategy, it is possible to see the broader rationale for these moves at this moment. First, such actions play well to a domestic Russian audience that wants to see Russia as the global counter-weight to the U.S. Russian President Vladimir Putin above all else craves respect, and his actions -- from invading Georgia to annexing Crimea to muscling into Syria on the side of the reprehensible Assad regime to active surveillance -- enhance his international importance and profile.

The movement of information is the lifeblood of the global economic system: it needs to be more secure from accident and attack.

Second, these types of high tech, delicate and complex undersea maneuvers constitute important training and preparation for the Russian Navy. The ability to tap these cables for intelligence as well as attack them with precision is a skill-based activity that requires detailed knowledge and real precision work at depth according to many reports. Practice is vital.

Additionally, the underwater maneuvers are a signal to the U.S. and its allies, much like the other recent aggressive international moves coming from Moscow. Russia is reaching for many other Cold War tools as well, including aggressive long-range bomber patrols above NATO nations (particularly the Baltic states) and building up significant military capability in the Arctic.

Are we headed back to another Cold War? Probably not, despite the ominous range of activities. We should remember that we still cooperate with Russian on a wide range of activities: counter-piracy patrols off the Horn of Africa, counter-terrorism information sharing, counter-narcotic activity in Central Asia, support to Afghanistan and constructing the controversial but widely accepted counter-proliferation agreement with Iran. Unlike the Cold War, there are zones of U.S.-Russia cooperation today.

We should convene an international conversation about protecting the underwater fiber optic grid system, much as we do for air and sea lanes of communication.

The Cold War dwarfed in size and scope anything we see today. The war saw millions of soldiers facing each other across the Fulda Gap in central Europe; two immense battle fleets grappling with each other across the oceans of the world; and two massive nuclear arsenals on a hair-trigger alert, ready to launch within minutes. We are not remotely at that point today.

So what we should do in response to Russian behavior around the world, including reports of underwater cable surveillance? We must avoid stumbling backwards into a new Cold War. This means maintaining open lines of communication, searching for zones of cooperation where we can find them (from the Arctic to Arms Control) and taking a deep breath when we see provocations before we respond militarily. We should convene an international conversation (to include Russia of course) about protecting the underwater fiber optic grid system, much as we do for air and sea lanes of communication.

But we must also stand firmly behind established principles of international law: nations should not simply annex the territory of their neighbors, as was done in Ukraine; nor should they support brutal, lawless, illegal regimes like that of Assad in Syria. We should rally as much international support as we can muster to criticize such behavior, and when it is particularly egregious -- as in Ukraine -- impose sanctions.

Our naval forces need to be ready to defend our submarine cables, exactly as we defend our electrical grid, industrial base and transportation networks.

Another important component is operational. Our naval forces need to be ready to defend our submarine cables, exactly as we defend our electrical grid, industrial base and transportation networks. That means a robust, highly technical and capable undersea Navy. The U.S. leads the world in operations underwater, and we absolutely must maintain that edge. In this context, exercises and operations with key allies and friends to protect this shared and vital undersea infrastructure is a good signal to send to the Russians as well. NATO allies, Japan, Australia and many other friends have significant undersea capabilities: by practicing and operating together, we help create a stable and protected global communication grid.

Finally, we need to build more resiliency and redundancy into the underwater cable network. It is far too vulnerable to sabotage, especially at the terminals where the cables are in relatively shallow water. We need more ""dark cables"" that are not operational but kept in reserve. The movement of information is the lifeblood of the global economic system: it needs to be more secure from accident and attack.

Russia's robust Cold War-like moves should be concerning, but we should remember what a weak hand of cards Russia actually holds: a declining population, high rates of alcoholism and drug abuse, few real allies and an economy that is a one-trick pony. As Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has said with a bit of hyperbole, Russia is ""a large gas station masquerading as a country.""

Despite these fundamental weaknesses, under Putin, the Russians will reach for Cold War tools in an effort to prove their global relevance.

The New York Times reported that Russian submarines and spy ships were aggressively operating near the vital undersea cables. Could they be preparing for a new form of warfare?

The perfect global cyber attack could involve severing the fibre-optic cables at some of their hardest-to-access locations in order to halt the instant communications on which the West’s governments, military, economies and citizens have grown dependent. Effectively this would cripple world commerce and communications, destabilise government business and introduce uncertainty into military operations. A significant volume of military data is routed via this internet backbone.

The fibre-optic cables that carry the majority of the globe’s internet traffic follow designated paths under the oceans. To cause world chaos, all that is needed is some “wire cutters” (realistically a submarine with a depth charge would do). This is not rocket science and there will be no need for clever hackers.

While there is no evidence yet of any “cable snipping”, there is concern among senior US and allied military and intelligence officials over the accelerated activity by Russian armed forces around the globe. At the same time, the internal debate in Washington illustrates how the US is viewing Russian moves with distrust. Surveillance activity shows a significant increase in Russian activity along the known routes of the cables and more than a dozen officials confirmed in broad terms that it had become the source of significant attention in the Pentagon.

Information warfare
-------------------

Talking to the BBC’s Gordon Corera, the deputy director of the US National Security Agency (NSA), Richard Ledgett, warned of the increasing danger of destructive cyber-attacks by nation states in addition to criminal organisations. A concerted cyber-attack against another nation state can result in the breaking down of society and the loss in ability to defend itself. Information warfare (IW) is an extension of electronic warfare, but importantly it embraces cyber warfare.

More than 50% of effort in future conflicts will be in both cyberspace and electromagnetically in the ether – this will be known as “information warfare”. It will disrupt radio communications, radar and intelligence surveillance, military command and control, weapon systems control, aircraft navigation, national infrastructures, emergency services, and all internet communication. Severing internet backbone networks will cause major worldwide disruption causing widespread suffering without firing a single shot in anger.

In March 2003, allied forces led by the US began Operation Iraqi Freedom. In the first few days of that conflict an information war took place that completely neutralised the ability of Iraq to use the electromagnetic spectrum and the internet. Its armed forces and its civilian infrastructure was virtually paralysed. The conflict lasted just 43 days and Iraq had a formidable and well equipped military.

Russia has long realised that this “soft” warfare, is the equal partner to the familiar hard-weapons side and is planning to spend billions perfecting techniques required. Cyberwarfare has become an important weapon in the military arsenal.

Attack on Estonia
-----------------

In April 2007, denial of service (DoS) attacks targeted Estonian websites including the Estonian parliament, banks, ministries, newspapers and broadcasters, amid the country’s disagreement with Russia on the relocation of the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn (a Soviet war grave monument) together with Soviet war graves in Tallinn.

Cyber analysts concluded that the cyber-attack on Estonia was well planned and sophisticated with no precedent. Although Russia vehemently denied involvement the foundations for future IW were becoming established. Military strategists worldwide study the attack to for its inclusion into an order of battle, and to develop mitigating measures.

Georgia was next
----------------

Military and government strategists did not have to wait long for another example of information warfare. On July 20 2008, just prior to the Russian military invasion of Georgia to support the self-proclaimed republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, a massive Russian-based internet DoS attack against Georgia began. Targets for the DDOS attack included websites of the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, the OSInform news agency and OS radio station. It was also reported that key sections of Georgia’s internet traffic had been rerouted through servers based in Russia and Turkey, where the traffic was either blocked or diverted – effectively closing the internet in Georgia for the duration of hostilities.

There was also circumstantial evidence that the Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline control system was targeted by a sophisticated computer virus similar to Stuxnet which led to an uncontrolled pressure incident. The Russian government again distanced itself from any cyber involvement and blamed the Russian criminal fraternity. However, observers have acknowledged that the resources needed for this level of attack point to a nation state involvement.

Ukraine as electronic war lab
-----------------------------

The escalating military conflict in Ukraine has featured a mirrored cyberwar between the two sides with DDOS and malware attacks against public websites, banks, radio and television channels and public utilities. At the same time Ukrainian forces have grappled with formidable Russian electronic warfare capabilities.

Russia has deployed its new multi-functional Krasukha-4 electronic warfare systems to support Ukrainian separatists and “volunteer” Russian combat troops. It is the Krasukha-4 that has been deployed to Syria. Russia has again denied any involvement in the Cyber-attack and blames criminal organisations. But this is the first time a fully integrated IW has been witnessed.

Lieutenant-General Ben Hodges, the commander of the US army in Europe, has described the Russian capability as “eye watering” and confirmed that US army personnel from NATO are working alongside their counterparts in the Ukrainian army to gain first-hand experience of information warfare from a state-based adversary.

Is Russia is developing the capability to repeat Operation Iraqi Freedom on a global scale? If its investment in information warfare is any measure we should be concerned – this investment in information warfare is not being matched by the US and Europe combined.

Western leaders should be made aware that we need to accelerate our development of information warfare capability and train more people to deal with it, but above all we should stop isolating Russia in the world and putting it in a position where it feels the need to cash in on this investment.","The article discusses the potential threat of Russian attacks on undersea cables, explicitly mentioning 'cutting the undersea cables' and 'severing the fibre-optic cables'.

Four senators sent a letter Tuesday to three top Obama administration officials seeking information on ""what steps are being taken, and what steps need to be taken, in order to enhance the security of the undersea network"" of cables.

There are fewer than 300 fiber-optic submarine cables crisscrossing the world, connecting every continent except Antarctica. Most of the cables are approximately three inches in diameter and heavily insulated, though deeper sections of the cables are less protected. Despite being perhaps the most critical element of the global communications system, the cables go largely unnoticed by most of the world’s population.

""[W]e are increasingly concerned with what a targeted attack on the cables the U.S. depends on could result in.""

But the Russian government recently spooked American officials by sending a submarine equipped to cut undersea cables down the East Coast of the United States. The move sparked fears that Russia could enhance a kinetic war with physical sabotage of the Internet’s central nervous system.

This concern motivated Sens. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), James Inhofe (R-Okla.), and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) to send their letter to Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, and Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson.

""Due to increased Russian aggression and their presence in waters these cables rest in, we are increasingly concerned with what a targeted attack on the cables the U.S. depends on could result in,"" the senators wrote.

Sabotage isn’t the only concern. Natural disasters can also rupture the cables. Nine of them snapped during the 2006 Hengchun earthquake in Taiwan, and the massive 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami damaged a cable that connected Japan and the western United States.

Because of the interdependence of these cable systems, a rupture in one country can take down access to large parts of the Web in countries on the other side of the continent.

Although there is significant redundancy in the transatlantic cable system, underserved areas like the Middle East and Africa are vulnerable to massive disruptions from a single cable break. The Mediterranean and the Middle East suffered widespread service disruptions during three incidents in 2008 that remain unsolved. (One contested theory is that abandoned or improperly dropped anchors damaged the cables.)

The senators’ request for information about cable protection will likely meet with resistance from the military, which is typically reluctant to discuss the specifics of defensive measures. But the letter, which urged the creation of ""a national security strategy that incorporates the vulnerability of our undersea network,"" could spur action on Capitol Hill to formally adopt such a strategy.","The article discusses 'undersea Internet cables' and highlights concerns regarding their vulnerability, particularly in light of Russian military actions aimed at potentially cutting these cables.

Atkinson lists “SCARAB Remotely Operated Vehicle Design Work” as his focus from 1992-1996. Here’s the part on thrilling submarine spycraft:

He further describes his works as the “undetected penetration of the cable itself, and of splitters, repeaters, and amplifiers modules.” This was done, in Atkinson’s account, with AT&T Bell Labs, the U.S. Special Collection Service, the U.S. navy, and at submarine shipyards. The Special Collection Service is a joint NSA/CIA venture, tasked with collecting information on communication not just passing through the United States but, according to documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, as they’re observed elsewhere in the world.

Atkinson’s work at the time, as spelled out plainly in his profile, worked with nuclear-powered attack submarines to see if they could become spy machines, with remotely operated vehicles cutting into and splicing the communication cables under the sea.

The U.S. has opted for a diving digital approach to combat against cyberattacks. It is reported that U.S. submarines are being used as underwater hacking platforms to target underwater communications cables or the infrastructure of other nations.

Where cyberwarriors working for Moscow and other regimes are already prodding and jabbing at U.S. networks, this approach by the U.S. comes as a surprise to some. However, in 2015, it was reported that USS Annapolis is one of the Navy’s special submarines that has cyber-offensive capabilities, as part of the 2013 Edward Snowden leaks.

According to Adam Weinstein and William Arkin, writing last year for Gawker’s intelligence and national security blog, Phase Zero, the Annapolis is a premier computer network exploitation (CNE) toolkit, a portable hacking platform that snoops on any designated target, be it another country’s infrastructure, military troops, or its underwater communications cables.

The subs represent an important part of America’s cyber strategy. According to two U.S. Navy officials at a recent Washington conference, they not only act defensively to defend themselves and the country from digital attack, but also interestingly they play a part in carrying out cyberattacks.

“There is an offensive capability that we are, that we prize very highly,” said Rear Adm. Michael Jabaley, the U.S. Navy’s program executive officer for submarines. “And this is where I really can’t talk about much, but suffice to say we have submarines out there on the front lines that are very involved, at the highest technical level, doing exactly the kind of things that you would want them to do.”

American submarine fleet has been using information technology to gain a competitive edge over the enemy. For instance, in 1970s, the U.S. government would use its submarines for unauthorized connections to the Soviet submarine cable and record messages, exchanged between the armed forces of the USSR. (The National Security Agency (NSA) has continued that tradition; wiretapping submarine cables has become part of the action covering the entire world of the U.S. intelligence apparatus. In some cases, the government even entered into the transaction with the owners of cable networks, which provided American spies secure access to the information communicated on such cables.)

Some U.S. subs these days come armed with sophisticated and powerful antennas that can be used to intercept and even manipulate other people’s communications, particularly in poorly protected or unencrypted networks.

In a typical week, a leaked slide showed that the Navy carries out hundreds of so-called “computer network exploitations.”

“Annapolis and its sisters are the infiltrators of the new of cyber warfare,” wrote Arkin and Weinstein, “getting close to whatever enemy – inside their defensive zones – to jam and emit and spoof and hack. They do this through mast-mounted antennas and collection systems atop the conning tower, some of them one-of-a-kind devices made for hard to reach or specific targets, all of them black boxes of future war.”

However, this is nothing. The next the Navy wants to do is to be able to turn its submarines into motherships for underwater drones that can move themselves even closer to shore and carry out jamming or hacking operations while letting the sub to work at a distance.

“We want the boat to grow longer arms,” said Rear Adm. Charles Richard, director of the Navy’s undersea warfare division. “We are at all-ahead flank [speed], both on unmanned aerial and undersea vehicles.”

When it comes to submarine-based cyber offense, there is no clarity as to how far behind or ahead other country’s navies are. However, one thing is clear that U.S. military have some of the most complex information networks ever designed, and they are using them to infiltrate into foreign computer systems as a part of developing cyber strategy.","The article titled 'U.S. using submarines to hack other countries' discusses the role of U.S. submarines in cyber warfare, specifically their capabilities to target and manipulate underwater communications cables.

President Trump's executive order and the Commerce Department’s ""Entity List"" create new challenges for Huawei’s 5G wireless technology in the U.S. But in the meantime, the Chinese telecom giant is racing ahead under the world’s seas.  

**Why it matters:** Globally, about 380 submarine cables carry the vast majority of international data, from cloud computing to text messaging. These cables will only become more important with the arrival of 5G and other services that will increase the speed and volume of data being transferred.  

**Where it stands:** The underseas cable market is changing with the entrance of new players.  
- A decade ago, Chinese companies were involved with just a handful of cables, almost exclusively in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong.  
- Now China wants to dominate the global market. Huawei is building or improving nearly 100 submarine cables around the world.  
- At the same time, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and other leading content providers are investing in their own underseas cable projects.  

**Between the lines:** China’s digital silk road is where two of Xi Jinping’s signature policies meet:  
1. Made in China 2025 is aggressively growing high-tech industries with state subsidies and ambitious targets, including capturing 60% of the global market for fiber optic communications.  
2. The Belt and Road Initiative is an avenue for Chinese firms to expand into foreign markets and reach these targets, backed by a promised trillion dollars of infrastructure spending.  

**Flashback:** History cautions that today’s commercial activities carry strategic stakes as well. In World War I, Britain was best positioned to maintain global communications among its forces and to monitor and disrupt enemy messages thanks to its network of cables.  

**The bottom line:** So far, U.S. actions are focused on limiting Huawei’s access to Western markets. But to shape tomorrow’s communications networks, it would also have to compete in developing and emerging markets — especially in Asia and Africa, where 90% of global population growth by 2050 is expected.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, highlighting their role in global data transfer and Huawei's involvement in building and improving these cables.

Washington is worried about Moscow’s ability to disrupt global Internet communications.

Russia has been stepping up its submarine patrols near remote locations of fiber optic cables laid on the ocean floor and carrying digital data across continents. Pentagon officials and European diplomats compared Russian activities to Cold War levels, when both East and West repeatedly tried to tap undersea cables to extrapolate intelligence.

The United States is particularly concerned about Russia’s capabilities to interrupt global internet traffic communications by cutting undersea cables in the event of a conflict. Russian submarine patrols have risen by over 50 percent in the last year.

However, the precise nature of Russian activities remains highly classified. “It would be a concern to hear any country was tampering with communication cables; however, due to the classified nature of submarine operations, we do not discuss specifics,” a U.S. Navy spokesman stated.

It is also an open secret that the United States has been the most active in tapping undersea cables across the world oceans and collecting intelligence.

Most people are not aware that our global digital connectivity rests upon fiber optic cables lying at the bottom of the oceans. 99 percent of transcontinental Internet traffic travels through these cables; these are the lifelines of our economies.

Most cable cuts occur due to ship anchors, natural disasters, or fishing nets. While the technical reliability of these cables is high, international politics have created three problem zones in the world where outages could have severe consequences: the Luzon Strait, the Suez Canal-Red Sea-Mandab Strait passage, and the Strait of Malacca.

Russia, however, would potentially hurt its own economy by cutting cables in the event of a conflict. The real issue is the repair time following a cable cut, which can last from a few days to weeks, depending on the response of the cable system owner and national government involved.

Rather than seeing it as a hindrance to improving relations, the growing vulnerability of undersea cables should be seen as an opportunity for “undersea cable diplomacy” to bring potential adversaries together. The real threat to global connectivity is often bureaucratic red tape in one’s own country.","The article 'Undersea Cables: How Russia Targets the West’s Soft Underbelly' discusses the vulnerability of undersea cables, particularly in the context of Russian submarine activities.

Hidden beneath the world’s oceans lies an extraordinary technological feat — a network of cables stretching across the ocean floor for hundreds of thousands of kilometers, serving as our underwater power grid and information superhighway. Submarine cables, also known as subsea cables, are key to accelerating the green energy transition and form the backbone of the communication revolution.

There are currently around 600 in-service and planned submarine cable systems, stretching nearly 1.4 million kilometers across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and other strategic passages. Subsea power cables, particularly those using high-voltage direct current (HVDC) technology, can transmit substantial amounts of power across long distances. For example, the spans around 760 kilometers between the U.K. and Denmark and has a capacity of 1,400 MW, which is enough to power some 1.4 million homes. Subsea telecom cables, meanwhile, are capable of transmitting and offer the fastest and most reliable method of data transfer available today.

The fact that data and electricity travel between continents through cables not much thicker than a garden hose is a remarkable feat of engineering and multilateral collaboration. Given their pivotal role in facilitating data transfer and expansion of new technologies like AI, subsea cables have become critical to maintaining order and driving economic growth in the digital age. So, what is a submarine cable made of and how is it installed?

**Critical subsea infrastructure**

Submarine cables can be divided into two categories: high-voltage power cables and telecommunication cables. High-voltage power cables carry renewable power from offshore energy farms to the land, whereas telecom cables ferry data between continents. Each type has a different core, insulator, and armoring to ensure the cable can perform its intended function. 

When they are laid down, cables nearer to the shore are buried under the seabed for protection. In the deep sea, they are placed on the ocean floor by modified ships carrying thousands of kilometers of cables on board. These cables are slowly laid out on the seabed between continents according to optimized routes.

Cable routes are meticulously planned to avoid fault zones, fishing and anchoring areas, and other potential hazards as they form the backbone of the global internet. Damage to these cables, whether accidental or intentional, poses a significant challenge. Man-made threats, such as shipping activities, can inadvertently damage cables through anchoring or trawling. More concerning are deliberate acts, where cables are intentionally cut or tampered with. Such actions can cripple communication networks, disrupt financial markets, and even pose national security risks.

In the context of national security, the security and integrity of these networks have become a matter of national interest as well as regional and global concern. As such, countries are increasingly focused on ensuring that this critical infrastructure is secure and protected. This involves not only safeguarding the physical cables but also ensuring that they are constructed and maintained by trusted manufacturers and suppliers.

**Optimizing cables in the era of AI**

Resilient cable infrastructure can reduce the impact of potential disruptions, and can play a significant role in its construction, maintenance, and optimization. In fact, the private sector owns and operates a substantial portion of the global submarine telecommunication network, with tech giants estimated to own or lease most of the undersea bandwidth between them. In the era of AI and cloud computing, these investments are crucial as the digital landscape evolves, driven by the increasing reliance on AI, edge computing, and Internet of Things (IoT).

As data centers’ demand for electricity continues to rise, power cables will need to carry higher voltages, and advanced insulating materials can help achieve the necessary performance levels while improving overall efficiency and conductivity. Better insulators are therefore crucial for subsea power cables, especially when building high voltage grids for the energy transition.

**Building better cables**

Hanwha Solutions Chemical Division, with its cable insulation technologies including cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE), Super Extra-High Voltage (SEHV), and Compound LDPE Natural Submarine (CLNS), is helping to build better cables that can more efficiently transmit energy from offshore energy farms to data centers. In 2022, Hanwha Solutions became the first Korean company to develop a semiconductive material that is needed to manufacture high-voltage power cables. This year, it reached another milestone by becoming the first Korean company to develop a specialized insulator for cables, positioning itself as a leader in this sector.

Given their ability to transmit large amounts of electricity over long distances, subsea power cables enable the integration of renewable energy sources into the power grid, making them essential for the push toward a more sustainable and resilient energy system. According to CRU, a raw materials analysis firm based in the U.K., the global demand for subsea cables is projected to increase from $4.6 billion in 2022 to $21.3 billion in 2029.

Hanwha is committed to responding rapidly to the growing global demand for energy. By securing advanced technologies that help to build robust grid infrastructure, Hanwha aims to play a proactive role in supporting the next digital revolution and the power needs of the future.","The article titled ""Submarine cables and the digital revolution"" discusses submarine cables, their critical role in telecommunications and power transmission, and the implications of damage to these cables.

If the Americans could locate sunken subs and retrieve satellites from the supposedly inviolable deeps, their underwater black ops directly threatened Soviet security.

When a July 2015 undersea tremor triggered a rockslide between the islands of Saipan and Tinian in the Northern Marianas Islands, it cut the only fiber-optic cable connecting the archipelago to the global network. Air traffic control grounded flights, automated teller machines shut down, web and phone connections broke.

All the feared impacts of a cyber attack became real for the islanders. A Taiwan-based cable repair ship eventually restored the link, but that was a single break from one natural occurrence. How much more disruption could a deep-sea-faring nation cause its rivals through malicious intent?

Though often mentioned in passing, the fact that the overwhelming bulk of Internet activity travels along submarine cables fails to register with the public. High-flying satellites orbiting the crowded skies, continent-spanning microwave towers and million miles of old 20th Century copper phone wire all carry but a fraction of the Earth’s Internet traffic compared with deep-sea fiber-optic cables.

If you want to tap into that buzz, those quiet places where the sea cables make landfall—from the onshore facilities out to deep-water offshore—are your prized targets. The U.S. has developed exquisite abilities to access underwater things.

One of America’s greatest techno-spy capers of the Cold War involved tapping Soviet Navy communications via a submarine cable in the 1970s and 1980s. Before IVY BELLS ended with its unmasking by Soviet spy Ronald Pelton, its clandestine aquanauts, spy sub and nuclear-powered “bug” made espionage history.

If, however, you wish to practice hybrid warfare—disruption and degradation with little overt engagement—then the ability to cut submarine cables at will and at depth gives you a very powerful weapon. Cut up undersea hydrophone networks and you deafen your adversary. Cut Internet cables and you have the ultimate denial-of-service cyber weapon.

Amidst a wave of 1960s deep-sea activity—including its saturation-diving SEALAB program, its search & recovery missions for _USS Thresher_, _USS Scorpion_, a lost H-bomb and a new submarine-rescue approach—Admiral Hyman Rickover got his dream sub built. Launched in 1968, _NR-1_ was a marvel of American ingenuity—a nuclear-powered four-man minisub able to dive over 3,000ft and stay there for weeks.

During the later Cold War, the USSR developed its own very sophisticated underwater black ops capabilities. Targets included the US Navy’s SOSUS underwater hydrophone system which ran along the Atlantic from Greenland to the United Kingdom at depths of up to 12,000ft. With its primacy in titanium metallurgy and skill in nuclear technology, the Soviet Union built several competitors to the _NR-1_.

The Russian Federation inherited these assets along with the Ministry of Defense branch (GUGI, or Main Directorate Deep Sea Research) that supervised those programs. The Russian deep-sea clandestine systems survived the collapse of the USSR and received funding even during the lean years during the 1990s. Even as the United States lost the _NR-1’s_ capabilities to retirement, Russia bolstered its deep-sea black activities.

Between August and October 2012, a Russian Arctic expedition mapped the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean to locate resources and establish maritime boundaries. A deep-sea “research” submarine placed a small Russian flag on the ocean floor some 13,200ft below the North Pole to mark Russia’s claims.

The “research sub” was in fact one of Russia’s secret deep-sea assets, the nuclear-powered minisub _Losharik_. A naval blogger pointed out that clues to _Losharik’s_ internal configuration lay in the vessel’s name. “Losharik” is a cartoon horse made of linked spheres—some analysts suspect that the sub’s interior consists of linked spherical titanium pressure hulls.

_Losharik_ rides to its dive sites in the belly of a larger converted nuclear missile sub, the _Orenburg_. Both have been busy—_Orenburg_ recently surprised Norwegian scientists by popping up from beneath the sea ice after doing who-knows-what.

“It was inexpedient to use GUGI equipment for scientific exploration and mineral extraction,” said a Russian source. “On the other hand, they are the world experts in manned deep-water investigations and the training of their crews is on the same level as that of cosmonauts. If we don’t find a job for them, Russia is likely to lose this highly skilled workforce.”

With _Losharik_, its sister sub _Nelma_ and the two bathyscaphes _Rus_ and _Consul,_ the GUGI commands the largest manned deep-sea fleet in the world. Whether domestically produced or foreign imports, these assets can be quietly moved around within Russia itself. Combined with its growing submarine-rescue fleet and Naval Spetznaz outfits, Russia now fields a very powerful undersea hybrid warfare capability. Let’s hope the US Navy is on the case.

Government surveillance and the tapping of communication cables is not a new threat to public privacy. Edward Snowden may have brought to light some of the NSA’s more recent eavesdropping strategies, but citizen surveillance in America has a much older history. In fact, tapping civilian communication lines dates all the way back to the late 1800s and America's occupation of the Philippines, which in part served as a test-run for the US to figure out how they could create a surveillance state in the burgeoning information age.

Long before whistleblower Edward Snowden or any mention of the PRISM program, people were intercepting one-another’s phone calls. Early phone systems required a human operator to patch through a call, and that human connection made it very easy for a third-party to eavesdrop. But it wasn’t until the creation of operator-free phones that we saw the invention of modern cable tapping.

In order to try and get a better sense of how the history of surveillance has evolved since people first learned how to use a telephone, I gave surveillance expert and NSA critic James Bamford a call. He’s an American best-selling author of a book called Body of Secrets in which he explores the history of citizen surveillance in America, to find out more about how cable tapping originated.

Bamford explained that, “in the early 20th century a lot of communication cables were made from copper, which made tapping them quite a bit easier than today’s fiber optic cables.”

He also noted that a hacker, “wouldn’t need to use any invasive measures to tap a copper cable,” because they radiated electromagnetic energy. Instead of splicing it, Bamford explained you would only need to wrap the cable in a bugging device that could pick up the vibrations of its passing information.

Throughout the last century there have been plenty of examples of American governments tapping domestic and foreign communication lines. Including 1945’s Project SHAMROCK where the Armed Forces Security Agency received a microfilm copy of every telegram that entered and left the country. Or the Watergate Scandal in which President Nixon attempted to wiretap the Democratic National Committee headquarters.

But just as these types of above-land interceptions began to become commonplace, Russia, the Cold War threat, moved their communication cables somewhere very out of reach—the bottom of the ocean floor.

But don’t worry, America found a way to tap that too. They implemented Operation Ivy Bells, a covert operation to tap the Russian submarine communication cable in the Sea of Okhotsk. This cable was in an important location that joined the major Soviet Pacific Fleet naval base at Petropavlovsk on the Kamchatka Peninsula to the Soviet Pacific Fleet's mainland headquarters at Vladivostok. As Bamford pointed out, “the US had a big big interest in finding out what was going on on that cable. So they sent a navy submarine called the USS Halibut to tap it, even though it was in enemy waters”. He continued, “the submarine stayed close to the shorelines. To find the cable they searched for signs along the coast directing local fishing boats to steer clear of underwater lines.”

In the instance of operation Ivy Bells, the US army felt the cable could divulge invaluable information about Russian missile operations, and so it’s relatively easy to understand their motives for surveillance. But after the Cold War, these methods did not disappear. In fact, they grew stronger and stronger as world-wide underwater communication cables grew alongside the rise of the Internet.

Today, every single country is plugged into hundreds of inter-connected submarine communication cables that are collectively known as the “backbone of the Internet”. Together these lines communicate about 99% of all Internet data around the world. The image below shows exactly where most of these underwater cables are located. Unsurprisingly, many submarine communication cables have landing points on US or US friendly soil.

Because of the relatively easy-to-hack nature of copper cables, as well as their limited capabilities, most of the modern submarine communication networks run using fiber optics. Unlike their radiating predecessors, fiber optic cables use a beam of light to transfer data and that beam cannot usually be detected outside of the cable itself. That means that you cannot easily tap fiber optic cables without risky invasive procedures. But even so, there are a couple of ways to do it and Bamford walked us through the first one:

“Fiber optic cables don’t use electricity like copper cables do; they use photons, a beam of light, to transfer data. To tap a fiber optic cable you put a prism into the cable itself so it forms a sort-of crystal triangle. When the light beam hits the prism one light beam then splits into two light beams. The original light beam continues on to wherever it was going—an email, Facebook, another country, whatever. Then the second light beam—this new mirror image—is directed to a nearby surveillance data center.” Well, I guess now we know where the PRISM name comes from.

The second way to tap a fiber optic cable is by bending the cable until it leaks light. This method is both non-invasive (so it’s harder to detect by security systems) and relatively cheap. For around $1000, any hacker can purchase the equipment necessary to pull off a fiber optic cable tap on land, although if the cable happens to be underwater the cost would probably be a lot higher.

Both tapping methods are an effective way to source private internet data and we know, thanks to Snowden, that these methods have been employed by the NSA. In fact, as Bamford explained to us, there is a still active US navy submarine called the USS Jimmy Carter that was rumored to have been outfitted with a hull specifically designed to allow technicians to tap fiber optic submarine cables while remaining underwater.

The PRISM revelations brought to the world by Edward Snowden and the Guardian showed the world that cable tapping is common practice in government surveillance, and it probably isn’t going anywhere. One only needs to recall the Five Eyes—an intelligence partnership finalized in 1980 between Canada, the United States, England, Britain, and New Zealand to completely spy on the world—to realize this is nothing new. Although the methods of tapping communication gateways has evolved from bugging telephone lines and tapping submarine cables to collecting internet metadata and filling up military data centers with digital information, the heart of the operation remains the same.

For a very long time, our governments have been tapping civilian communication lines without public knowledge, in order to gain access to our most intimate information. The frightening truth is that it probably won’t stop. So maybe the next time you’re thinking of sharing some important piece of information via email, try hand delivering a note instead. Or try something really novel and have a conversation in person. It’s more secure that way.

The unnamed officials speculate the Russians might be trying to tap those links — or even worse, completely sever them during a time of crisis.

That’s exactly what unnamed U.S. military and intelligence officials have been telling influential news outlets such as _The New York Times_.

They’re not alone. Last week, retired NATO Supreme Commander Admiral John Stavridis warned that undersea fiber-optic cables handle almost all the world’s Internet communications and represent a serious security vulnerability should an adversary attack them.

This week, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators requested information from the secretaries of state, defense and homeland security regarding the safety of nearly 200 fiber-optic cables that link the globe electronically.

""Due to increased Russian aggression and their presence in waters these cables rest in, we are increasingly concerned with what a targeted attack on the cables the U.S. depends on could result in,"" the senators said in their request.

**Cables cut all the time**

""Nearly all the world’s Internet traffic passes at some point through an underwater cable,"" said Doug Madory, director of Internet research at the cyber-intelligence firm Dyn. ""And rarely a week goes by that there isn’t a submarine cable break somewhere in the world.""

According to the firm TeleGeography, approximately 200 active submarine cables crisscross the ocean’s floors. These cables electronically link all of the world’s continents, except Antarctica, and nearly every island with a human population.

Undersea cables are generally around a mere 3 inches in diameter and composed of various layers of insulation, steel cables and water protection. Deep inside are bundles of thin optical fibers — tiny, flexible fibers marginally larger than a human hair. Each can each carry huge amounts of digital data; together they handle over 95 percent of all Internet and phone data between continents.

Some nations, such as Cuba or New Zealand, have only one main cable connecting them to the global Internet.

""For countries relying on a single submarine cable, the loss of that cable could be crippling for their Internet service,"" Madory told VOA. ""They may be able to fall back on bulk satellite service, but satellite has much greater latency and less capacity.""

The U.S., by contrast, has several dozen cables connected to its Atlantic and Pacific coast hubs.

**Shark snack**

Exposed along the vast expanses of ocean seafloor, these cables face a wide range of hazards, including dragging anchors and, in some areas, sharks that inexplicably like chewing on the cables' polyethylene sheathing.

""When close to shore, these cables are encased in protective metal shielding and buried up to 3 meters deep in the seabed, but out in the deep sea they are unprotected and as thin as a garden hose,"" said Madory. ""If someone was able to locate these cables at sea, they could easily cut them.""

So could one nation sabotage another by simply mapping those cables and tapping into them — or, worse, cutting them?

""The U.S. and the former Soviet Union repeatedly tapped each other’s land lines during the Cold War,"" noted Christopher Harmer, senior naval analyst with the Institute for the Study of War and retired deputy director with the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet.

""The U.S. Navy tapped the Russian Pacific Fleet data lines for at least a couple of years,"" said Harmer.

Harmer and Madory agreed that in most areas, undersea cables could easily be cut and that the Russians have a few vessels capable of deep sea maneuvers.

Harmer said the Pentagon has long been aware of the cables' vulnerabilities to potential threats.

""Transoceanic cables are high-value targets that are extremely vulnerable to attack,"" Harmer told VOA via email. ""The U.S. Navy is highly aware of the threat, has simulated the scenarios, understands the risks, but does not have the assets to mitigate the risks.”

**Cutting vs. tapping**

However, Madory downplays the size of the problem for the U.S.

""There are multiple cables crossing the Atlantic and Pacific, providing enormous capacity and resilience for the Internet in North America,"" Madory wrote via email. ""To even make a dent in U.S. international connectivity would require simultaneously taking out multiple cables.

""If a perpetrator with a submarine wanted to cause maximal downtime, they could attempt to cause multiple breaks at harder-to-reach locations on multiple cables, but the impacts would be fleeting,"" said Madory. ""So would such a Hollywood scenario be worth trying to pull off?""

""I don't think the Russians have a significant advantage here,"" said Harmer. ""Their economy has devolved into a resource extraction economy; they need customers for it. Cutting data lines also cuts off their customers in Western Europe from communication with North America. The real threat is IT [Internet technology] theft by China or Russia.""

Madory disagrees. ""Experts in the industry are very doubtful that it is possible to tap a fiber-optic cable on the seabed without it being noticed,"" he said.

Perhaps not, said Harmer. But that doesn’t mean that someone isn't trying.","The article discusses the vulnerabilities of undersea cables to being cut, including explicit mentions of the potential for sabotage and the geopolitical implications of such actions.

Russia’s Navy is a highly visible and generally well-understood instrument of Moscow’s military power that has been on a slow process of re-equipment from its 1990s nadir. It now wields a fairly impressive range of capabilities, from new medium-sized ships, such as corvettes and frigates, nuclear-powered attack and ballistic missile submarines, and advanced weapons, including the Kalibr cruise missile first demonstrated attacking targets in Syria. There is, however, another far more shadowy force available to Moscow which forms Russia’s “Secret Navy”: the Main Directorate of Deep-Sea Research, or Glavnoye Upravlenie Glubokovodsk Issledovanii (GUGI).

The Directorate was formed in 1976 and since then has existed separately from the rest of the armed forces administratively, physically, and operationally. For example, rather than being part of the Navy, it circumvents that chain of command and reports directly to the Ministry of Defence. Further, its staff and vessels are housed at discrete bases held apart from other military facilities, notably at Olenya Bay near Russia’s border with Norway, where a specialised covered dock keeps the most sensitive assets hidden from surveillance.

Such measures are justified by the specialised and exotic nature of GUGI’s operational responsibilities. These range from oceanographic survey to the placement and maintenance of deep-water military equipment, including submarine-detection systems, as well as the identification, tapping, and potential destruction of subsea communications cables.

With President Vladimir Putin revealing the Kanyon/Status-6 long-range nuclear torpedo (now officially named Poseidon) this year, GUGI will likely become responsible for this weapon system too, rendering the Directorate a key component of any Russian second-strike effort should atomic war erupt.

To achieve such a diverse array of missions, GUGI has a range of equipment that appears almost James Bond–esque. Among the more standard units it has are a range of “ocean research vessels”, such as the Yantar, which hold specialised equipment, including miniature submarines, able to identify and interface with underwater communications cables.

More broadly, GUGI has advanced unmanned assets, including some of the world’s largest autonomous vessels, the Harpsichord series, and the (potentially nuclear-powered) Harmony surveillance system planned for the Arctic.

But such assets pale in comparison to the Directorate’s fleet of eight or more nuclear-powered special-mission submarines, the largest and most diverse force of its kind in the world.

These come in two main groups. First, there is a range of fairly small vessels, ranging from the 40-metre Nelma to the modern 74-metre Losharik capable of diving as far down as 2500 metres. These submarines are equipped with advanced position-keep equipment and specialised robotic arms that enable them to approach, deploy, retrieve, maintain, and interfere with underwater infrastructure.

These vessels are transported around the world by two large mother-submarines, modified versions of Delta-III and IV ballistic missile units, from which they detach and reattach underwater, beyond prying eyes. The mother-submarines provide the additional food, water, and living space for the smaller vessels’ crews to reach distant areas of operations (being nuclear-powered, range is not a constraint for such craft).

However, perhaps the most impressive GUGI asset, still yet to be completed, will be the enormous Belgorod, which when finished will be the longest submarine in the world. This vessel will likely serve to provide yet another highly modern mother-submarine for the rest of the GUGI fleet, and will also be able to launch the Poseidon torpedo. At 24 metres long and nearly 1.5 metres wide, this weapon is so large that it will be far too big to fit in an unmodified submarine (a regular torpedo is nearly 30 times smaller), leaving its use restricted to the Belgorod and another specialised unit, the Khabarovsk.

While GUGI is of course small compared to Russia’s primary naval forces, it has outsized relevance to NATO, and potentially also Australia. Its submarines and surface vessels have been increasingly active, particularly around transatlantic communications cables. By some estimates, 99% of global international data (including phone and internet) moves through these cables rather than paths such as satellites, meaning Russia, through tapping the cables, has access to an extremely rich source of peacetime intelligence information, and the ability to hold it at-risk should tensions rise.

Notably, Australia is just as dependent on cables. The government has demonstrated recent sensitivity in keeping foreign firms, such as Huawei, from involvement in building such regional infrastructure. Russia could seek to tap our communications too, aiming to access sensitive information through a “soft underbelly”, as it once did through the spy-ring which led to the formation of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.

Alternatively, having its own interests in Antarctica, Russia would doubtless be willing to apply the technology and lessons learned by GUGI in the Arctic.

Considering these issues, it might be well worth paying as much attention to Moscow’s other Navy as is currently directed towards the more standard ships and submarines of Russia’s fleet.

It now wields a fairly impressive range of capabilities, from new medium-sized ships, such as corvettes and frigates, nuclear-powered attack and ballistic missile submarines, and advanced weapons, including the Kalibr cruise missile first demonstrated attacking targets in Syria.

There is, however, another far more shadowy force available to Moscow which forms Russia’s “Secret Navy”: the Main Directorate of Deep-Sea Research, or Glavnoye Upravlenie Glubokovodsk Issledovanii (GUGI).

The Directorate was formed in 1976 and since then has existed separately from the rest of the armed forces administratively, physically, and operationally. For example, rather than being part of the Navy, it circumvents that chain of command and reports directly to the Ministry of Defence. Further, its staff and vessels are housed at discrete bases held apart from other military facilities, notably at Olenya Bay near Russia’s border with Norway, where a specialised covered dock keeps the most sensitive assets hidden from surveillance.

Such measures are justified by the specialised and exotic nature of GUGI’s operational responsibilities. These range from oceanographic survey to the placement and maintenance of deep-water military equipment, including submarine-detection systems, as well as the identification, tapping, and potential destruction of subsea communications cables.

With President Vladimir Putin revealing the Kanyon/Status-6 long-range nuclear torpedo (now officially named Poseidon) this year, GUGI will likely become responsible for this weapon system too, rendering the Directorate a key component of any Russian second-strike effort should atomic war erupt.

To achieve such a diverse array of missions, GUGI has a range of equipment that appears almost James Bond–esque. Among the more standard units it has are a range of “ocean research vessels”, such as the Yantar, which hold specialised equipment, including miniature submarines, able to identify and interface with underwater communications cables.

More broadly, GUGI has advanced unmanned assets, including some of the world’s largest autonomous vessels, the Harpsichord series, and the potentially nuclear-powered Harmony surveillance system planned for the Arctic.

But such assets pale in comparison to the Directorate’s fleet of eight or more nuclear-powered special-mission submarines, the largest and most diverse force of its kind in the world.

These come in two main groups. First, there is a range of fairly small vessels, ranging from the 40-metre Nelma to the modern 74-metre Losharik capable of diving as far down as 2500 metres. These submarines are equipped with advanced position-keep equipment and specialised robotic arms that enable them to approach, deploy, retrieve, maintain, and interfere with underwater infrastructure.

These vessels are transported around the world by two large mother-submarines, modified versions of Delta-III and IV ballistic missile units, from which they detach and reattach underwater, beyond prying eyes. The mother-submarines provide the additional food, water, and living space for the smaller vessels’ crews to reach distant areas of operations (being nuclear-powered, range is not a constraint for such craft).

However, perhaps the most impressive GUGI asset, still yet to be completed, will be the enormous Belgorod, which when finished will be the longest submarine in the world. This vessel will likely serve to provide yet another highly modern mother-submarine for the rest of the GUGI fleet, and will also be able to launch the Poseidon torpedo. At 24 metres long and nearly 1.5 metres wide, this weapon is so large that it will be far too big to fit in an unmodified submarine (a regular torpedo is nearly 30 times smaller), leaving its use restricted to the Belgorod and another specialised unit, the Khabarovsk.

While GUGI is of course small compared to Russia’s primary naval forces, it has outsized relevance to NATO, and potentially also Australia. Its submarines and surface vessels have been increasingly active, particularly around transatlantic communications cables. By some estimates, 99% of global international data (including phone and internet) moves through these cables rather than paths such as satellites, meaning Russia, through tapping the cables, has access to an extremely rich source of peacetime intelligence information, and the ability to hold it at-risk should tensions rise.

Notably, Australia is just as dependent on cables. The government has demonstrated recent sensitivity in keeping foreign firms, such as Huawei, from involvement in building such regional infrastructure. Russia could seek to tap our communications too, aiming to access sensitive information through a “soft underbelly”, as it once did through the spy-ring which led to the formation of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.

Alternatively, having its own interests in Antarctica, Russia would doubtless be willing to apply the technology and lessons learned by GUGI in the Arctic.

**Author:** H I Sutton

During the Cold War the USS Halibut was modified for 'Underwater Engineering', a euphemism for covert intelligence gathering operations. Because her missions were kept Top Secret, photo or illustrations of her modifications are virtually non-existent. In particular, the configuration below the waterline.  
  
In 1965, within 5 years of entering service as a nuclear deterrence missile submarine, the USS Halibut was already outmoded and surplus to requirements. This was when she was converted into a secret spy submarine.  
  
Halibut is most famous for performing the first wire-tap on the Soviet military's undersea communication cables in the Sea of Okhotsk in 1970. The missions were known as **IVY BELLS**.  
  
The tap itself was a large cylinder which had to be put in place by divers operating from the hovering submarine which was anchored to the sea floor.  
  
There were many technical innovations and developments which enabled Halibut to perform its Top Secret missions. Key to IVY BELLS' success were the USN Divers who lived in the pressure cylinder mounted above the rear torpedo room.  
  
In the early days of nuclear deterrence, USS Halibut was the only nuclear powered submarine designed to launch nuclear cruise missiles. She was constructed at the juncture between the 'old style' submarines which had hulls shaped for surface running and the newer 'Albacore hulled' boats with rounded bows and pointed sterns for high underwater speed.  
  
**Specification**  
Displacement: 3,655 tons surfaced, 5,000 tons submerged  
Length: 350ft (110m)  
Beam: 29ft (8.8m)  
Propulsion: S3W reactor, 7300 shp; two turbines, two shafts  
Speed: 15kts surfaced, 20kts submerged (before refit), after refit.... much slower  
Complement: ~90-100 men including 'civilian' technicians and divers  
Armament:  
5 x Regulus I nuclear cruise missiles (removed 1965)  
4 x 21"" (533 mm) torpedo tubes in bow  
2 x 21"" (533mm) short torpedo tubes in stern  
  
Ostensibly SEALAB was a scientific experiment with civilian relevance, including for space exploration. This was partly true, but hidden within the civilian justification was other top secret research: saturation diving for covert intelligence missions.

The [USS Parche](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/spy-submarine-no-other-come-aboard-uss-jimmy-carter-48812)—pronounced Par-chee—remains the U.S. Navy’s most decorated vessel ever in American service.

The [USS _Parche_](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/spy-submarine-no-other-come-aboard-uss-jimmy-carter-48812), commissioned in 1974, originally began life as a Sturgeon-class nuclear-powered fast attack submarine. After serving for several years in that role, the _Parche_ was selected for a different, more specialized role of top-secret reconnaissance. What would be the submarine’s target? The Soviet Union’s underwater communications cables.

In that role, the [USS Parche](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/spy-submarine-no-other-come-aboard-uss-jimmy-carter-48812) was modified several times to allow the sub greater maneuverability and to make space onboard for extra communications equipment, cameras, thrusters, landing skids, and additional sonar arrays.

The enormous amount of observation equipment that the _Parche_ carried came at a cost, however. Almost all of the submarine’s torpedoes were removed to create extra space onboard—leaving the submarine with a paltry four shots for defense in case of detection. Like other Navy submarines tasked with clandestine wiretapping missions, the _Parche_ carried a [dangerous secret](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/us-navy-submarine-terrified-russia-simple-reason-42377).

In the event that the _Parche_ was in danger of being captured by the Soviet Union, the submarine carried 150 pounds of HBX explosives onboard—a last resort scuttling charge that would preserve the submarine’s secrets and cost all the submariners their lives.

**Ivy Bells**

Perhaps the most significant (known) mission that the _Parche_ took part in was the clandestine [tapping of a Soviet underseas communication cable](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/intelligence-coup-how-one-us-nuclear-submarine-tapped-russian-undersea-cables-159086) in the [Sea of Okhotsk](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/why-did-us-air-force-send-b1-bombers-russia%E2%80%99s-doorstep-159111). The cable, running along the ocean floor, connected one of the Soviet Pacific Fleet’s bases at Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky on the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia’s far east, with the Fleet’s headquarters in Vladivostok.

The cable would be [a tough nut to crack](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/how-super-secret-us-navy-submarine-tapped-russias-underwater-21370). Not only was it within Soviet territorial waters, it was also protected by an array of acoustic listening devices that could detect surface ships and submarines. The Sea of Okhotsk also hosted Soviet Navy drills on occasion, complicating efforts to penetrate the area.

Despite the challenges, a large wiretap recording device was successfully planted in 1971 by a different espionage submarine, the [USS Halibut](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/heres-what-we-can-now-tell-you-about-uss-halibut-americas-cold-war-spy-submarine-113861)_._ Once the _Halibut_ was decommissioned, however, the _Parche_ became one of the submarines that took over the wiretapping and recording device recovery role. _Parche_ was never detected.

The USS _Parche_ also took part in cable detection and tapping operations near the North Pole and in the Barents Sea. _Parche_ would win a staggering amount of honors, including ten Presidential Unit Citations, nine Navy Unit Citations, and thirteen Expeditionary Awards.

**Postscript**

After thirty years of continuous service, the USS _Parche_ was decommissioned in 2004 and scrapped two years later. It is likely that the special spy role conducted by the _Parche_ has since been taken over by the [USS Jimmy Carter](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/we-now-have-details-uss-jimmy-carter-spy-submarines-secret-mission-129272), a modified [Seawolf-class submarine](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/us-navys-seawolf-submarine-just-sent-message-russia-168371). Today, the USS _Parche’s_ sail is preserved and on display near the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Washington.

No, the U.S. Navy is probably not using a multi-billion dollar submarine to listen in on your phone calls and emails on behalf of the National Security Agency.

But it could.

A long line of secretive Navy spy submarines, most recently a nuclear-powered behemoth named USS _Jimmy Carter_, have for decades infiltrated remote waters to gather intelligence on rival states’ militaries, insurgents and terrorists on behalf of the NSA and other agencies using a range of sophisticated devices, including special equipment for tapping undersea communications cables.

Before NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed the agency’s phone and Internet monitoring programs targeting U.S. and European citizens, the mainstream press paid little attention to the elusive, subsurface warship. But following Snowden’s disclosures in 2013, several publications including the Huffington Post and the German _Der Spiegel_ speculated that the _Jimmy Carter_ was aiding the NSA’s surveillance of citizens’ communications in the U.S. and Europe.

“It seems this same submarine,” the Huffington Post claimed, “was pressed into service to spy on Europe.”

The modified _Seawolf_-class sub, built by General Dynamics Electric Boat in Connecticut between 1998 and 2004, is almost certainly _able_ to tap the undersea communication cables that carry much of the world’s phone and Internet traffic. But just because the warship _can_ tap cables doesn’t mean it routinely _does_.

At the Navy’s request, Electric Boat inserted an extension in the middle of _Jimmy Carter_‘s hull that added 100 feet to its standard 350-foot length — plus nearly $1 billion to the baseline $2 billion price tag. Commander Christy Hagen, a Navy spokesperson, declined to comment on the warship’s modifications.

But Owen Cote, a submarine expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said _Jimmy Carter_‘s hull extension most likely contains a “moon well” — a floodable chamber to allow divers, robots and machinery to move between the sub’s interior and the water, retrieving objects off the seafloor or carrying monitoring devices and other surveillance equipment.

With this, _Jimmy Carter_ could, in theory, tap seafloor fiber-optic cables, said Norman Polmar, a naval analyst and author who has advised the government on submarine-building strategy. “You hook something on to the cable,” Polmar said, “and come back in a month and remove the tape and take it back and analyze it.”

But underwater wiretapping is probably unnecessary. “I don’t think you need to use _Jimmy Carter_ to do that,” Cote said. “It would be a waste of that asset.”

It’s far easier for the NSA to monitor Americans’ communications on land, Cote pointed out in an interview, with the consent of phone and Internet providers.

But it wasn’t long ago that _Jimmy Carter_‘s predecessor subs _were_ involved in undersea eavesdropping — against America’s Cold War rivals. That espionage took place during a technologically simpler time, when Washington had fewer ways of listening in on communications.

“Fifty, 60 years ago, this was best method of collecting certain intelligence,” Polmar says of eavesdropping submarines. Before _Jimmy Carter,_ there were the modified submarines _Halibut_, _Seawolf_ and _Parche_, fitted with special equipment for monitoring and accessing objects on the seafloor, including communications cables. _Parche_, the last of the old breed, was decommissioned in 2004, just as _Jimmy Carter_ was nearing completion.

The subs’ secret missions, the subjects of repeated investigations by high-profile reporters including Seymour Hersh in _The New York Times_, were practically the stuff of fiction.

In 1968, the Pentagon deployed _Halibut_ to the Pacific to search for the wreckage of a sunken Soviet submarine that would later be partially recovered by a CIA team aboard a purpose-built salvage ship. Trailing a four-mile long cable rigged with cameras, _Halibut_ found the Soviet vessel in 16,000 feet of water after just three weeks.

In the 1970s, _Seawolf_ and _Parche_ took risky missions penetrating the Soviet navy’s main North Atlantic bastions to tap military communication cables. The two subs sailed under the Arctic at speeds of just a few miles per hour to avoid icebergs, dodging Soviet vessels and excitable seals and walruses that might betray the U.S. ships’ locations.

The special subs placed on the cables clamp-like devices that recorded passing signals, giving Washington valuable insight into Soviet naval activities. In 1980, a former NSA employee named Ronald Pelton betrayed the subs’ operations to the Soviets in exchange for around $35,000. Pelton was arrested in 1986, tried and convicted. He remains in federal prison.

The Soviets’ discovery of the undersea wiretap alerted America’s rivals, making such missions much more difficult. “People are now aware that that’s a technological capability that we have — and that puts them on guard,” Polmar says.

The disclosure, and new technology advances, has led to an apparent shift in the spy subs’ tactics. When North Korea shelled a South Korean island base in 2010, _Jimmy Carter_ reportedly surfaced nearby and launched a small, quiet drone spy plane to photograph the damage. Since then _Jimmy Carter_ has undoubtedly stayed busy performing other surveillance missions and, in 2013, entered a roughly yearlong period of maintenance at a shipyard in Washington State.

Now that the submarine has returned to the fleet, it will surely resume its secret duties as America’s main underwater spy. But the special sub probably won’t be listening in on your phone and Internet conversations. Too dangerous against military rivals and unnecessary for domestic surveillance, submarine wiretaps seem to have fallen out of favor.

You’re still being spied on — just not by a submarine. Exactly what _Jimmy Carter_ _is_ doing is hard to say.

“I’m sure,” Cote laughed, “it’s up to no good.”","The article provides a detailed discussion on the USS Jimmy Carter's capabilities, specifically mentioning its potential to tap undersea communication cables.

The Beginning of Submarine Cables
-------------------------------------

The first submarine cable was laid in the English Channel in 1851. The cable, which was mistaken for a new kind of seaweed, was quickly severed and became unusable the next day, but the idea spread rapidly. About 20 years later, in 1872, with the laying of submarine cable between Nagasaki, Japan and Shanghai, China, Japan was incorporated into the global network of submarine cables. The laying of submarine cables became a key national policy at that time.

In the latter half of the 19th century, Western countries actively advanced overseas. Submarine cables were used as a tool for overseas expansion. In 1881, King Kalakaua of Hawaii, which was an independent kingdom, visited Japan and requested the construction of an underwater cable between Japan and Hawaii, but Japan, being in the middle of the political upheaval of Meiji 14 (1881), could not meet this request. At the beginning of the 20th century, 60% of the world's undersea cables were owned by the British Empire or its state-owned companies. Hawaii was the last place on the Pacific route to which the British Empire was trying to connect, but it was blocked by the United States, which had great interest in Hawaii. When the Spanish-American War broke out in 1898 and the United States acquired the Philippines and Guam, it became necessary to secure a route from the west coast of the United States to Guam, and as a result Hawaii was annexed to the United States. Submarine cable installation to Hawaii became a challenge, but it was accomplished without government subsidies by businessman John W. Mackay.

Hawaii and undersea cables played an important role in raising US interest in the Pacific. For 100 years, submarine cables have been associated with geopolitical factors.

2. Submarine Cables and War
----------------------------

When World War I broke out, Britain issued a declaration of war on Germany and, as soon as it came into force, severed German submarine cables in the North Sea. The purpose was to block much of Germany's communications and to divert them to Sweden, a neutral country, in order to facilitate wiretapping.

During World War II, wireless telegraphy was often used in addition to wired communications. As a result, the role of telegraph undersea cables has relatively declined, but it is no exaggeration to say that wiretapping determined the outcome of the war. The interception and breaking of the Japanese Purple code and the German Enigma code are well known.

As many undersea cables had been destroyed in World War II, wireless communications were used extensively after the war. However, since wired communications were harder to intercept than wireless communications, the remaining wired undersea cables were also used. As the Cold War intensified, Operation Ivy Bells was launched in the Sea of Okhotsk to intercept Soviet submarine cables. Submarine cables at that time used copper wire as the core and, when a communication signal ran through the cable, a weak signal was emitted from the cable. The United States installed equipment on Soviet seabed cables to monitor the signal, and regularly collected the equipment to analyze the data. The Soviet Union did not even encrypt communications in such places, not realizing they would be intercepted. However, a Soviet spy in the US government notified the Soviet Union of the US' wiretapping of the submarine cables, and the Soviet Union reportedly recovered the equipment.

In the 1980s, the technology to put optical fibers instead of copper wires in the core of cables was established, and communication capacity increased dramatically. The signals flowing through the cable were changed from electrical signals to optical signals, making it impossible to intercept submarine cables at the bottom of the sea like in Operation Ivy Bells.

3. Changes in Operational Domains
----------------------------------

In June 2013, Edward Snowden, who worked at the National Security Agency (NSA) facility on the island of Oahu in Hawaii, handed over top-secret NSA documents to journalists, revealing some of the Agency's activities. In the leaked documents we found a description of programs called PRISM and UPSTREAM. It is believed that the former meant acquiring data from platform companies such as Google, while the latter meant acquiring information on submarine cables. Although it is extremely difficult to intercept optical fiber cables at the bottom of the sea, the NSA is believed to have been able to intercept signals on land with the cooperation of telecommunications carriers. The NSA has not confirmed the authenticity of the leaked information, but it appears to be part of a larger surveillance of communications by the US government since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001.

Since around 2010, the US military has regarded space as its fourth operational domain and cyberspace as its fifth, in addition to the conventional operational domains of land, sea, and air. However, unlike the other four operational areas, cyberspace is an artificial domain. Cyberspace consists of physical entities such as communication terminals (PCs and smartphones), wired and wireless communication lines connecting them, and data centers that contain servers.

As long as they are physical, they can be physically damaged or destroyed. In fact, many submarine cables have been damaged by fishing nets, anchors and earthquakes. In 2013, a submarine cable was intentionally severed in Egypt. In 2015, the New York Times reported that ""Russian submarines and spy ships are aggressively operating near the vital undersea cables"" and in 2019 Admiral James Stavridis (retired) argued that ""China's next naval target is the Internet's underwater cables"", thus raising awareness that submarine cables could become targets for destruction.

4. Submarine Cable Industry
----------------------------

Looking at the submarine cable industry, Subcom in the United States holds around 40% share in the manufacturing of submarine cables, NEC in Japan (via its affiliate OCC) roughly 30%, Alcatel-Submarine Networks (ASN) in Europe approximately 20%, and Hengtong Optic-Electric (which acquired Huawei's submarine cable division) in China less than 10%. In addition to the importance of the cables themselves, vessels for laying and repairing submarine cables, power feeding equipment (PFE) and submarine line terminal equipment (SLTE) in landing stations are also important factors in considering the safety of submarine cables.

Amid growing interest in submarine cable security, one case that garnered attention was the suspension of the PLCN (Pacific Light Cable Network). The cable, which was owned by Google and Facebook in the US and the Dr. Peng Telegraph & Media Group in China, was intended to connect to Hong Kong across the Pacific from Los Angeles on the US West Coast. However, as the trade and technological friction between the United States and China as well as the demonstrations in Hong Kong intensified, the US government refused to allow the landing in Hong Kong. The PLCN was changed to land in the Philippines and Taiwan.

Then, in August 2020, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the ""Clean Network"" project to exclude Chinese products from US apps, the cloud, submarine cables and elsewhere.

Communication monitoring is a measure implemented and emphasized by countries seeking to improve their cyber security capabilities. For example, at the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games, the US NSA collaborated with the UK Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) to share signal intelligence (SIGINT). This measure reportedly included monitoring of submarine cables.

5. Summary
-----------

Submarine cables are strategic assets for governments in the information age. Since digital transformation (DX) is a key technology for the future economy, submarine cables based on clean technology are an indispensable element, and they are even more important for Japan, an island country that relies on submarine cables for 99% of its international communications.

It goes without saying that the Japanese government must exercise caution in monitoring communications bearing in mind the secrecy of communications (Article 21 of the Constitution and Article 4 of the Telecommunications Business Law). However, in order to prevent cyber attacks and communications-aided terrorist attacks, consideration should be given to surveilling communications, including those utilizing undersea cables, with supervision and auditing by democratic institutions.

**The Prize**

One of the Soviet Union’s important naval bases was located on the Kamchatka Peninsula, in Russia’s far east. The peninsula abuts the Sea of Okhotsk, a large bay west of Kamchatka and northeast of Japan. Though very far from Moscow, the Kamchatka Peninsula naval base was connected to another naval base at Vladivostok, near the Soviet Union’s border with China and North Korea. Their connection was more than figurative. It was discovered that an underwater communications cable connected the two bases and was used heavily to communicate with each other—and connected Kamchatka with Moscow.

The potential intelligence that could be gleaned from tapping the Kamchatka-Vladivostok cable was great, as would be the difficulty in gaining access to the cable. Most of the cable ran through the Sea of Okhotsk, a heavily protected bay that the Soviet Union considered to be part of its territorial waters. There were extensive anti-submarine obstacles and acoustic listening devices with which to monitor surface and underwater traffic. It would be a tough mission, but if successful, immeasurably valuable.

**The Boat**

Not just any submarine could be sent deep underwater to tap a cable however, a special sub was needed. The nuclear-powered USS Halibut was chosen for the tapping mission. Originally diesel-powered, Halibut had been converted to nuclear power and repurposed for special operations missions. To better serve as a special operations-capable sub Halibut underwent several modifications to support Navy divers. Special skids were installed to allow the sub to sit on the ocean floor, anchors were placed along the hull to keep the sub in place, a diving chamber mated to the deck to allow divers access to the outside, as well as an array of photographic and robotic equipment.

Though the Americans knew the Kamchatka-Vladivostok cable existed, they did not know exactly where. Looking for a slender cable on the seafloor would have been like looking for a needle in a haystack, and dangerous. The cables were allegedly found thanks to the signs posted on the shore where the cables left the sea, warning fishermen and boaters not to drop their anchors or nets in the areas indicated by the cables to prevent them from fouling.

**The Mission**

The top-secret nature of the Halibut’s mission precluded most of the sub’s crew from knowing what the true nature of the cable tap mission was. To protect mission secrecy, the crew was told that they would be attempting the recovery of a weapon over a Soviet missile range, which was in fact the mission’s secondary objective.

One of the technical challenges was gaining access to information being transmitted through the cable, without cutting into the cable itself. A breach could cause a short circuit and alert the Soviets that something was up. Instead of cutting into the cable, divers were able to pull information via induction by wrapping another cable around the main comms cable.

The first tap successfully harvested information, but not in a form that was actionable. The cable was actually about a dozen different lines all talking at the same time. Separating the speakers' voices into different audio channels was done in subsequent taps.

Ultimately Ivy Bells was a success. The twelve or so different lines of audio could be separated. The Soviet Union was so sure that the line was secure, not all of the communications that went through the line were encrypted. Ivy Bell’s secondary weapons harvest mission was also a success and American engineers were given enough of the recovered missile to make a reverse-engineered copy.

**Postscript**

Ivy Bells was eventually discovered, though not through any detection of the part of the Soviet Union. In 1980, an indebted former NSA intelligence analyst approached the Soviet embassy in Washington D.C. and revealed the existence of the Kamchatka-Vladivostok cable tap, ending its nearly ten-year run.

There appears to be renewed interest in undersea cables, however. Not secret communication cables, but fiber-optic internet cables that carry much of the world’s internet traffic which, if severed could potentially cripple governments or economies thanks to the degree to which the world depends on the internet. In a time of crisis, severing underwater internet cables could be catastrophic. We are it seems, going back to the future.

Gen. Michael Hayden laughed off claims about breaking into undersea cables in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. “I’m not going to sit here and dissuade you from your views,” Hayden said, before refusing to comment on Jimmy Carter‘s mission. Two years later, the Journal again reported that the submarine’s role suggested an undersea spook, citing “people knowledgeable about it.” After more than a decade of apparently very active service, little else has slipped out about the ship or her operations.

On January 20, 2013, the Seawolf-class attack submarine USS Jimmy Carter left her home port in Bangor, Washington. Less than two months later, the submarine appeared at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii for repairs.

It was all quite mysterious. During her time at sea, we don’t know where Jimmy Carter was or what her crew of nearly 150 were precisely doing. The Seawolf class is one of the most secretive weapons in America’s arsenal, and information about the Navy’s “Silent Service” is difficult to discover... 

We know Jimmy Carter was on some kind of mission, which the ship’s official annual history vaguely referred to as Mission 7. “Performed under a wide range of adverse and extremely stressful conditions without external support, this deployment continued USS Jimmy Carter‘s tradition of excellence in pursuit of vital national security goals,” the history stated.

Another clue is the Presidential Unit Citation for Mission 7. For the sailing branch, this is akin to giving the boat itself a Navy Cross, the service’s second highest award. The criteria makes it clear that the mission must have been “extremely difficult and hazardous.” But the Secretary of the Navy’s citation for the sub’s 2013 performance is equally obtuse.

Further lending credibility to Jimmy Carter‘s real spying mission, the Navy retired the equally shadowy USS Parche just four months before putting the new submarine into action. The sailing branch says Parche is the most decorated ship ever, with nine Presidential Unit Citations among other awards.

Success at Okhotsk paved the way for missions in the far more crowded—and therefore dangerous—Barents Sea.

We could easily have to wait another decade or more for there to be any real confirmation—likely from a book like Sontag and Drew’s rather than the Navy—about Jimmy Carter‘s unique history and details about Mission 7.

These cables are essential for EU-Asia digital communication and trade, and their disruption could severely impact the global economy and EU's economic security. The article discusses the strategic importance of these cables, the limited repair capacities within the EU, the geopolitical challenges of cable maintenance, and the straightforward methods by which such cables can be targeted. It underscores the necessity for comprehensive maritime security that includes undersea cable protection, urging a unified NATO approach and the exploration of alternative data routes through the Arctic for enhanced digital resilience.

The ongoing crisis in the Red Sea has generated considerable discussions and debates, primarily focusing on the detrimental effects of the Houthis assaults on commercial ships and Iran’s “creative” use of its proxies as part of its forward defense strategy. Amid these discussions, however, an equally alarming prospect has received insufficient attention: the intentional damaging of undersea cables in the Red Sea and its impact on the global economy and the economic security of U.S. allies in the European Union (EU).

The strategic significance of undersea cables in the Red Sea for EU-Asia connectivity cannot be overstated. These cables serve as the backbone for digital communication and trade between Europe and Asia, rendering them prime targets for disruption by hostile actors. From an economic perspective, the EU’s heavy dependence on fast and reliable connectivity underscores the imperative to safeguard undersea cable networks. With over 70 percent of EU-based companies relying on online services like cloud computing, it is evident that any prolonged disruption would have significant repercussions for the EU’s economic security and global trade. Given the central role of social networks in Europe's highly digitalized societies, social life could be severely disrupted if these cables or their landing stations were to come under attack.

Any prolonged disruption could have dire consequences for the EU's overall security. Therefore, the vulnerability of these cables to intentional damage must be a significant concern on par with the current apprehensions regarding Houthi attacks on commercial vessels traversing the Red Sea. The reason behind this assertion is twofold.

First, while the immediate threat may appear distant, policymakers and strategic planners in Brussels must recognize the potential risks associated with factors such as the redundancy level of cable networks, the EU’s limited repair capacities, and the possibility of simultaneous attacks on both cables and landing stations.

Ten cable systems spanning the Red Sea, Suez Canal, Mediterranean, and Indian Ocean collectively form the core of digital connectivity between mainland Europe and the trading blocs of Southern and Eastern Asia. Of particular concern in this context is the European Union's constrained repair capacity and the recent politicization of cable projects, which are unfortunate byproducts of fast-intensifying geopolitical contestation between the United States and China.

Regarding the former, repair works are outsourced to external partners as part of the industry standard fuelled by a desire to cut costs and increase efficiency. Under the Mediterranean Cable Maintenance Agreement (MECMA), which covers the ten cable networks linking the EU with East/South Asia, the repair will be done by two cable ships stationed in Italy and France. However, due to the extensive geographical coverage area, repair capacities are notably limited, increasing the likelihood of prolonged outages in simultaneous attacks.

Low redundancy levels and a dire lack of alternative cable systems for rerouting data flow between the EU and East/South Asia pose a similar, if not more dire, challenge should the Mediterranean cables become inoperative. While not solely a consequence of the escalating digital divide between the West and China, the politicization of cable projects exacerbates this vulnerability. Initiatives like the Clean Network will likely curtail future cable projects, perpetuating the EU’s reliance on a limited number of networks and exposing it to continued outage risks. A clear illustration of this predicament is the fate of South East Asia–Middle East–Western Europe 6 (SEA-ME-WE 6), which was halted due to Washington’s objection to China’s involvement despite its predecessor, SEA ME WE 5, being a collaborative endeavor involving American and Chinese companies.

While damaging undersea cables may initially appear complex, carrying out such activities is not a sophisticated mission. Undersea cables can be targeted through various means, with physical destruction being the most common method. The least complicated approach involves “weaponizing” civilian vessels using improvised devices like anchors to cause damage intentionally. These attacks are cost-effective and do not require sophisticated undersea capabilities. Another form of physical attack is the use of undersea explosives, which can be carried out by a range of actors due to their relative ease of implementation. This method involves deploying maritime improvised explosive devices, and Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) naval branch has mastered this capability, considering it as a cost-effective strategy in the Strait of Hormuz.

Overall, if resilience is the main pillar of digital autonomy, geopolitical instability in areas like the Red Sea poses a significant yet understudied strategic risk. Specifically, there is a genuine concern for the spillover effects of political instability whereby non-state actors and their state supporters may view undersea cables in major data chokepoints as legitimate targets for retaliation against perceived illegitimate or illegal policies or actions.

As a vital conduit for connectivity between the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean, the Red Sea is a prime example of such a chokepoint where there is a potential for Iran-backed Houthi rebels to redirect their focus from passing vessels to targeting undersea cables as a more cost-effective and discreet form of offense. While there is currently no indication of intent from the Houthi leadership or the Iranian government to undertake such actions, it is imprudent to discount the plausibility of such a scenario in the future.

Moreover, the mere prospect of such hostile actions serves as a crucial reminder that maritime security in our fast-approaching digital era needs a rethink. Specifically, maritime security seems no longer confined to securing sea lanes of communication but also encompasses safeguarding what lies beneath, including undersea cables and critical mineral resources necessary for the green transition. This underscores the need for comprehensive approaches to maritime security that address both traditional and emerging threats.

For their part, the United States and its European allies must utilize their common NATO membership and develop a unified approach toward enhancing the security and resiliency of undersea cables. Currently, divergent approaches exist across the Alliance, with countries like France adopting a national security approach, leveraging their armed forces and security apparatuses to safeguard undersea infrastructure, while others like Denmark adopt a more industry-led approach. However, to ensure digital resilience across the Alliance, there is a pressing need for a unified NATO approach to undersea cables.

Additionally, the EU needs to scale and speed up efforts at diversifying data routes connecting Europe to Asia, especially considering the demand for fast and reliable data is set to rise. In this regard, Brussels should collaborate more systematically with its Nordic members, namely Norway, Sweden, and Finland, to expedite various connectivity initiatives at laying undersea cables to connect Europe with Asia via the Arctic. While technically challenging and financially demanding, undersea cables passing through the Arctic offer several advantages. They are shorter and, therefore, faster than those passing through the Red Sea, less susceptible to damage by natural causes, and face fewer intentional threats due to the limited passage of vessels in the Arctic. Most importantly, transforming Northern Europe into a data hub presents the EU with a reliable alternative and represents a significant step toward enhancing the security of its digital infrastructure.","The article discusses the strategic importance of undersea cables and their vulnerabilities, directly mentioning 'undersea cables' and their potential for intentional damage.

It explores the implications of such damage for EU-Asia connectivity and the global economy, emphasizing the need for enhanced maritime security.

The central theme revolves around the risks associated with these cables, making it a substantial discussion on the topic of cut sea cables."

The dangerous mission of installing a listening device on that cable was given to the navy most secretive and unusual submarine.

### Transcript
You know, it never ceases to amaze me just how much energy and resources the United States and the Soviet Union were willing to devote to hacking each other and other countries during the Cold War. We told some of the crazier stories in previous episodes of Malicious Life, like how the Russians planted a listening device – nicknamed The Thing – in a plaque that hung right above the ambassador’s desk in the American embassy in Moscow, or how the NSA secretly bought a Swiss crypto-machines manufacturer – Crypto AG – and sold flawed devices to dozens of countries all over the world.

It’s clear that the two superpowers were willing to go to great lengths to learn their rival’s secrets – but this week, we’re taking you back more than 50 years to an amazing operation — a joint enterprise of the US Navy and the NSA — that really raises the bar in that regard. Or should I say – lowers the bar?… Grab your wetsuits, and let’s dive right in…

### An Underwater Cable
It’s 3am in the morning, and James Bradely – Director of Undersea Warfare at the Office of Naval Intelligence – is sitting in his office, deep in thought.

In the early 1970’s. Ten years or so have passed since the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, but the world wasn’t a much safer place: both two superpowers had thousands upon thousands of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles aimed at one another, poised for launch at the figurative press of a button. Many of these missiles were installed on submarines which quietly prowled the oceans, hiding beneath the waves. It’s no wonder, then, that It was absolutely vital for the US to know the location – or at the very least the approximate patrol routes – of Soviet nuclear armed submarines.

The information he received did not specify the telephone line’s route, but Bradely had a strong hunch. The two naval bases – one situated near North Korea’s border with the Soviet Union, and the other in the Kamchatka Peninsula – were many thousands of miles apart by land, but only a few hundred miles or so by sea. It would make geographic and economic sense for the Russians to lay an underwater cable between the two bases rather than a much longer land line – especially since an underwater cable would be much more secure against eavesdropping than a landline.

…But that was exactly the problem.

Bradely was an experienced seaman. He served as a ship’s captain in the Pacific theater during World War II and the Vietnam war, and knew very well how difficult it would be – in fact, nearly impossible – to find a single underwater cable in the vast, empty expanse of the Pacific ocean floor. It would take literally _years_ of searching.

And what’s more, the Sea of Okhotsk – the body of water that separates the Kamchatka Peninsula from the Russian mainland – although formally designated as ‘international waters’ by maritime law, was aggressively claimed by the Soviet Union as territorial waters. Russian warships regularly patrolled the area, and the Soviet Navy even deployed a network of sound detection devices along the seafloor to detect any unwelcome, snooping visitors. Any encounter with a US warship sailing in the Sea of Okhotsk would definitely spark a serious international incident between the two rival superpowers.

So how does one go about finding a single telephone cable, no wider than five inches, running along the ocean floor at a depth of up to 11,000 ft. in a 600,000 sq. miles wide body of water, right next to the Russian coast – without being noticed?… If it were a television drama, the theme music of Mission: Impossible would surely be playing in the background.

This being 3am, Bradley let his mind drift in the muted clam of the empty offices around him. He returned, in his mind’s eye, to his childhood in St. Louis, Missouri. To the small boy who walked along the banks of the busy Mississippi River, watching the many boats cruising along the wide waterway, occasionally dropping their anchors along its shores…

And that’s when it hit him. There WAS a way to find the elusive cable. It would be extremely dangerous – even foolishly dangerous, some might argue – but it was doable, at least in theory. It would require a submarine, and not just any submarine.

Bradley, who also served on a sub in his days in the navy, was very familiar with the US submarine fleet – and he knew that there was only one sub, in the entire US fleet, which was capable of carrying out such an exceptional mission: a mission christened “Operation Ivy Bells.”

### The Halibut
The USS Halibut, aka SSN-587, was somewhat of a disappointment when it was first launched in 1959.

It was designed as a missile platform, and carried up to five Regulus I nuclear cruise missiles – the first sub specially designed to carry such missiles. But by the time the Halibut made her first dive – the Regulus I missiles it carried were already made obsolete by the much improved Polaris Ballistic Missile, which could be fired from underwater – while the Regulus missiles could only be fired from the surface. The Regulus program was promptly canceled, and the Halibut spent the next four years idly patrolling the Pacific ocean until the missiles it carried were finally retired for good.

But the Halibut itself was great sub: true, at 5000 tons of underwater displacement, it was rather small by contemporary standards – but it had an innovative nuclear reactor and a respectable maximum speed of 20 knots underwater. The navy’s chiefs decided, then, to refit it for a different role: finding stuff underwater.

And so in 1968 the Halibut underwent a complete overhaul. It was fitted with side thrusters that allowed it to hover in place underwater, a lateral sonar and a two-ton, 5M$, video-camera equipped mini-sub called ‘The Fish’ – one of the most advanced underwater technologies at the time. The missile hangar was converted to a high-tech lab where special support equipment was installed, such as a 24-bit UNIVAC computer (the first time a digital computer was installed in a submarine) and a full blown photo-development lab. The Halibut’s crew jokingly referred to the lab as The Bat Cave.

The Halibut’s first test came shortly after, when on March 8th 1968, K-129, a Soviet ballistic missile submarine, sank in the Pacific due to an internal explosion whose reason remains unknown to this day. The Soviets were unable to locate the lost sub, but the Halibut discovered it in only three weeks using its robotic remote-controlled cameras. The CIA was later able to recover part of the K-129 in what’s known as ‘Project Azorian’ – a fascinating tale that probably deserves a dedicated episode of its own.

The Halibut’s advanced capabilities and proven success made it perfect for James Bradely’s plans, and after asking for and obtaining the needed approvals from his superiors, he met with the Halibut’s captain – Commander John E. McNish – and explained his idea.

Bradley recalled from his youth that the Mississippi River banks were dotted with signs carrying the warning: ‘Cable Crossing – Do Not Anchor.’ This was because marine anchors were the most serious threat to the underwater cables that crossed the river, and frequently tore or damaged them. Bradley guessed that the Russian engineers would be worried about the same thing happening to their precious underwater telephone line – and so would surely position similar signs on the beach next to where the cable entered the water. He wanted the Halibut to covertly scan the Russian coast for such a placard, follow the cable as it left the shore into the sea – and attach an electronic listening device to it.

This was obviously an extremely dangerous mission. The Halibut would have to silently cross the Sea of Okhotsk, evading the network of sound detection devices and any Russian vessels that might patrol it, and sail right up to the Soviet coastline.","The article discusses a historical operation involving the US Navy and the NSA to locate and tap into a Soviet underwater communication cable.

It provides direct references to an 'underwater cable' and elaborates on the challenges and significance of this mission, making it a central theme of the narrative.

*By Laurence Peter BBC News*  
**03 January 2018**  

The Russian navy is very proud of its new spy ship, the Yantar, which is now doing Argentina a favour by helping to search for a missing submarine.

[Argentina has given up trying to rescue the 44 crew aboard the ARA San Juan](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-42187139), which disappeared on 15 November. But it still wants to find the diesel-electric submarine.

Enter the Yantar, officially an oceanographic research vessel, but actually bristling with surveillance equipment, and the mother ship for manned and unmanned deep-sea submersibles.

A Russian ROV - remotely operated underwater vehicle - is scouring the ocean floor off Argentina.

*The disappearance of the ARA San Juan remains a mystery*

But what else has the Yantar (Russian for ""amber"") been up to?

**Targeting undersea cables**  
The Yantar's movements were apparently what prompted a warning last month from the UK military that Russia could disrupt or cut vital undersea communications cables.

The chief of the UK defence staff, [Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, said such a strike against internet and other communications cables could be ""catastrophic"".](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-42365191)

Dozens of fibre-optic cables span the globe and Nato also has dedicated military cables on the ocean floor.

The Yantar is capable of tampering with them, says Igor Sutyagin, a London-based expert on the Russian military. But there is no evidence that it has done so.

""It's difficult to tap into optical fibres - it's just light inside, not electrical data,"" he told the BBC. ""It would be easier just to cut the cable.""

Mr Sutyagin noted that in the 1970s, during the Cold War, the US Navy had lost control of a Sosus undersea listening post for tracking submarines in the Atlantic. Sosus stands for ""Sound Surveillance System"".

The US military concluded that a Soviet submarine had cut the cables.

In the same period [the US military, reports say, planted listening devices on Soviet undersea cables in the Sea of Okhotsk, where Soviet submarines were based.](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/08/us/a-tale-of-daring-american-submarine-espionage.html)

A news report from the Russian parliament says the Yantar can do just such clandestine work, using deep-diving submersibles.

""The Yantar has equipment designed for deep-sea tracking, and [devices that can connect to top-secret communications cables,"" said Parlamentskaya Gazeta (in Russian) last October.](https://www.pnp.ru/politics/korabl-specnaznacheniya-yantar-voshyol-v-sredizemnoe-more.html)

Mr Sutyagin, of the Royal United Services Institute, says the Yantar belongs to Russia's Main Directorate of Underwater Research (GUGI in Russian), part of the defence ministry.

The 108m-long (354ft) vessel has a crew of 60 and went into service in 2015. It was built in the Baltic port of Kaliningrad, the first in a series called Project 22010. A second, called Almaz, will soon be on its way to the navy.

Russia already has several older spy ships. [In April, one of them, the Liman, sank off the Turkish coast after being breached in a collision with a freighter.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39734998) All its crew were rescued.

The Yantar can deploy the three-man submersibles Rus and Konsul, which can dive to about 6,000m (20,000ft).

**Spying on the US**  
The Russian parliamentary report noted that in the summer of 2015 the Yantar had deployed near the US Kings Bay naval base in Georgia.

""According to Pentagon officials, the Russians were gathering intelligence on US submarines' equipment, including underwater sensors in the DoDIN network,"" the Russian report said.

[Kings Bay is home to six US Trident ballistic missile submarines, each of them armed with 24 nuclear missiles, naval-technology website reports.](https://www.naval-technology.com/projects/kingsbaysubmarine/)

Mr Sutyagin said the US underwater sensors near Kings Bay would be interesting for the Russian military, which might wish to copy the US technology.

[Pentagon concern about the Yantar's cable-cutting potential was reported by the Washington Times.](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/3/us-shadows-russian-ship-near-nuke-submarine-bases/)

In late 2016 the Yantar was found to be loitering over undersea communications cables off the Syrian coast, including some links to Europe.

[The ship's strange movements were tracked by a website called Covert Shores.](http://www.hisutton.com/Yantar.html) The Yantar's frequent stops at points along a cable route suggested that a submersible was examining the sea floor, the report said.

**Search and rescue**  
Besides the Argentina mission, the Yantar has been used previously for search and recovery.

The Russian parliamentary report said the ship had located two Russian fighter jets - a Su-33 and a MiG-29 - that crashed into the Mediterranean in 2016, during the Syria war.

The Yantar ""recovered secret equipment from the planes in good time"", the report said.

That could be secret radar or missile data, or the ""identification, friend or foe"" system, Mr Sutyagin said.

[The disappearance of the Argentine submarine rekindled memories of Russia's Kursk submarine tragedy of 2000.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-42121663)

In 2000 a ship like the Yantar might have saved some Kursk sailors' lives and literally salvaged the Russian navy's reputation.

The Sunday Times reported that Russian intelligence agents have been sent to Ireland to gather detailed information on the undersea cables that connect Europe to North America. The news is alarming, intelligence agencies fear that Russia plans to carry out new cyber-espionage operations by tapping the undersea cables or even sabotage them.

""Russia has sent intelligence agents to Ireland to map the precise location of the fibre-optic, ocean-bed cables that connect Europe to America, gardai suspect. This has raised concerns that Russian agents are checking the cables for weak points, with a view to tapping or even damaging them in the future,"" reported The Sunday Times.

Ireland is a strategic place for intercontinental communications because it represents the place where undersea cables which carry internet traffic connect to Europe.

Garda and military intelligence agencies believe the Russian agents were sent by the military intelligence branch of the Russian armed forces, the GRU. The same branch that is suspected to have killed former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal.

The Russian spies were also seen monitoring Dublin Port, a circumstance that prompted local authorities in intensifying the control at critical infrastructures and landing sites along the Irish coast.

Experts believe that Ireland is a privileged target for Russian intelligence because it lacks a counter-intelligence capability.

Attacks against undersea cables are not a novelty; in 2014, The Register published information on a secret British spy base located at Seeb on the northern coast of Oman, a strategic position that allows the British Government to tap various undersea cables passing through the Strait of Hormuz into the Persian/Arabian Gulf. The documents also revealed the existence of other spy bases located in secret places identified with codes ""TIMPANI"", ""GUITAR"" and ""CLARINET"".

In June 2014, a new collection of Snowden’s secret files revealed that the US has made top-secret deals with more than 30 third-party countries to tap into fiber optic cables all over the world. The documents mention a clandestine program, coded as RAMPART-A, which was conducted with secret arrangements of other intelligence agencies.

Data provided in the reports are disconcerting; British telecommunications firms supported GCHQ in collecting a large volume of internet data from undersea cables, the overall amount of information from 2007 to 2012 registered a 7,000-fold increase, meanwhile, the spying system monitored nearly 46 billion private communications ""events"" every day.

The GCHQ paid Cable & Wireless more than £5 million ($9 million) as part of an annual lease for GCHQ to access the undersea cables. Despite the Cable & Wireless bought by Vodafone in July 2012, the Nigella surveillance access point remained active as of April 2013.","The article discusses the activities of Russian spies in relation to undersea cables, with direct mentions of 'undersea cables' and implications of potential sabotage.

After learning that this year’s National History Day theme would revolve around communication, I knew that I wanted to cover something related to espionage during the Cold War. I was intending to create a project based around the various communication methods used by famous spies in order to communicate their findings to their mother nations, but that theme was scrapped early on due to the lack of information yielded by the research I had done. After days of thorough research, I came across some articles on Cold War wiretapping, which eventually led me to Operation Ivy Bells.

After discovering the initial articles on the subject, I began scouring Google for any information I could find about Operation Ivy Bells. As I collected resources, I noticed that a large amount of the information on the missions was still classified to the general public, and I found it increasingly difficult to find credible sources. Nevertheless, I continued my research on the topic and was able to find articles on the events of the campaign, blueprints for the submarines that were used during the operations, and even interviews with some of the divers that participated in the missions themselves. In the end, there was just enough information available to the public eye to enable me to create this project.

I decided early on that I would be working alone this year, so I eventually concluded that I would create a website. I had all of the necessary information available to me, so it was only a matter of learning how to use the NHD website builder and making the site look presentable. Using the works of previous NHD winners as examples, I was able to learn how the program worked through experimentation, trial and error, and various guidebooks. Through this, I was able to give my website a simplistic, yet professional aesthetic.

Operation Ivy Bells fit this year’s theme of “Communication in History” in that it deals with the interception and utilization of communicated information. By the time World War II ended, the two global superpowers that were still standing were suspicious of each other’s activities. The American government jumped at a chance to gain the upper hand over the Soviets, who were equally as afraid of another global conflict as the Americans were, and created Operation Ivy Bells as a means through which to gather information. Using wiretaps and highly advanced rebreather equipment, the U.S. government was able to uncover a treasure trove of private Soviet data, which was eventually used to help ease the tension between the rival nations. Operation Ivy Bells was important in that without it, the Cold War could have either lasted even longer than it already did, or escalated further into a worldwide conflict.

### THE COLD WAR

With the end of World War II in 1945, only two global superpowers remained in the world: The United States of America, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Tensions rose between the two nations; the rival nations resorted to espionage campaigns, thus beginning “The Cold War”. As this passive-aggressive information war continued, both nations developed highly advanced methods of gathering, spreading, encrypting, and decrypting foreign intelligence.

### THESIS

The United States espionage campaign known as Operation: Ivy Bells, in which wiretaps were secretly placed on Soviet undersea communication lines, gave the U.S. unencrypted information on Russian nuclear strike capabilities, which ultimately led to the completion of the SALT II Treaty and indirectly had a hand in ending the Cold War.

### A PERILOUS GAMBIT

The combined efforts of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), United States Navy, and the National Security Agency (NSA) produced one of the most dangerous and ambitious covert submarine operations in history in an effort to gain the upper hand in the rapidly evolving information war.

In 1971, Captain James Bradley pitched his idea to intercept information from Soviet communication lines in the Sea of Okhotsk via wiretapping. The Soviet Navy had established a high-priority, nuclear-armed submarine base at Petropavlovsk on the Kamchatka Peninsula, and Bradley believed that there was a communication line that ran from the remote base to Moscow’s Pacific Fleet headquarters in Vladivostok, Russia. Targeting the Sea of Okhotsk was a high-risk gambit, as the Soviet Union had forbidden other vessels from entering through constant patrolling and underwater sound detection devices. Additionally, there was no clear-cut evidence that there was a cable there to begin with.

Nevertheless, the American intelligence agencies jumped at the chance of any advantage over their adversary, and began developing plans to wiretap the alleged Soviet communication lines. In 1972, Bradley dispatched the _U.S.S. Halibut_ to Kamchatka to find the Russian communication line. The team was able to narrow down their search time significantly thanks to posted signs on the Siberian coastline warning ships not to lay anchor. Equipped with heavily modified rebreather equipment, the specially-trained saturation divers plunged into the icy depths in search of the line. Despite the physical risks, they uncovered the 3-inch wide cables at approximately 400 feet below sea level, only 120 miles off the Russian coastline. After attaching the 20-foot-long listening and recording device, the _Halibut_ was able to eavesdrop on Soviet military information being sent between the two Navy bases completely undetected.

### AN INFORMATION GOLDMINE

Through the raw, unencrypted tape recordings recovered by the _U.S.S Halibut_, the United States was able to gain knowledge of the Soviet’s nuclear strike capabilities and limitations, as well as the rival nation’s recent tactical movements, which allowed them to gain an informational advantage over the USSR.

After recording as much information as physically possible, the _Halibut_ returned to America. Upon receiving the tapes, NSA intelligence analyzed the recordings for vital information, and found that most of the sensitive details were completely unencrypted. The _Halibut_’s tapes proved to be invaluable in gaining the upper hand over the Soviets.

### SUCCESSFUL NEGOTIATIONS

The United States was only able to successfully negotiate terms for strategic arms limitations with the USSR during the SALT II discussions because of the information obtained via wiretapping the Soviet’s communication lines.

From the Operation Ivy Bells tapes, government officials were able to glean a ground-breaking truth: The Soviets were just as afraid of war as them, equipping American negotiators to deal with Soviet affairs during the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT II).

### A NEW AGE OF ESPIONAGE

The success of Operation Ivy Bells encouraged the use of wiretapping throughout the rest of the Cold War and beyond, allowing the United States to gain an advantage over both the Russians and any other potential adversaries. 

If not for the betrayal of Ronald Pelton, an NSA analyst turned Russian mole, Operation Ivy Bells would have continued its regular missions and provided the United States with even more information regarding Russian military movements.","The article discusses 'Operation Ivy Bells,' which involved wiretapping Soviet undersea communication lines, thus closely relating to the topic of cut sea cables.

It details the operation's significance, the methods used to intercept communications through these cables, and the implications for military negotiations during the Cold War.

There was little public awareness of the purpose of the shipyard work and missions of the Mare Island-based spy subs until 1998, two years after the shipyard’s closure, with the publication of Blind Man’s Bluff, The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage, written by Sherry Sontag and Christopher Drew. Since its printing, the book has been a staple for anyone interested in the U.S. Navy’s clandestine “silent service” activity.

Mare Island historian Dennis Kelly, writing about the spy submarines in 2015, said that starting in the early 1970s the shipyard was home to what was known as the Ocean Engineering Program, “one of the most highly classified and important programs in the history of the U.S. military.” Under the program, Kelly, who was a longtime shipyard employee, said nuclear subs were secretly modified for intelligence-gathering assignments that were successful “until the American traitor Ronald Pelton sold out his country to the Soviets for $35,000 in the early 1980s.”

Pelton, a National Security Agency employee for 14 years, was arrested in 1985 after a Russian defector told authorities Pelton had sold the Soviets information on U.S. intelligence efforts, including the code-named “Ivy Bells” submarine spying. Convicted and sentenced to life in prison with possible parole, he was released from federal custody in 2015.

Mare Island work included 1971 modifications to the USS Halibut (SSN-587) that included a fake deep-submergence rescue craft mounted on the vessel’s deck. Actually, it was a decompression chamber that enabled divers to work safely at extreme depths outside the sub. Their first job following the shipyard modifications was to utilize the chamber 400 feet down in the Sea of Okhotsk while tapping a telephone cable linking two Soviet naval bases.

Capt. James Bradley Jr., director of undersea warfare at the Office of Naval Intelligence, came up with the wiretap plan. As a boy, he had seen “Cable Crossing – Do Not Anchor” signs on the Mississippi River, and had a hunch that there would be similar signs along the Russian coast. It took more than a week for the Halibut, running at periscope depth, to spot such a sign on a desolate beach and then find and track the five-inch-diameter cable as it ran out to sea from that point. About 40 miles offshore, divers placed a 3-foot-long external device on the cable, and the eavesdropping success resulted in a second Halibut voyage in 1972 to place a larger tap. The second device, nearly 20 feet long and weighing about six tons, was able to monitor many more phone lines and operate for months at a time.

At the start of the first trip, Halibut skipper John McNish kept most of his crew in the dark about the cable-tapping plan. But as the sub left on the second run, McNish briefed the men on their mission and the risks they faced. He also told his men that black boxes filled with explosives had been placed at forward, aft and midship locations, wired for self-destruct. If trapped, the sub would not be boarded and the crew would not be taken alive.

The Halibut returned to the Okhotsk site in 1974 and 1975, and other submarines, including the Mare Island-based USS Seawolf (SSN-575) and USS Parche (SSN-683), followed the same course. The Parche placed another large tap close to the first device and both taps remained in place until 1982 when the Soviets, alerted to their location by Ronald Pelton’s information, fished them out. One of the taps, marked “Property of the United States,” wound up in a Moscow museum for several years.

The Parche managed to tap a similar cable in the Barents Sea, resulting in a treasure trove of Soviet voice and data transmissions described by CIA, NSA and Navy officials as “the crown jewels.” The sub made four more voyages to the Barents Sea, and the Barents cable provided intelligence throughout the Cold War, which officially ended in 1991 with the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

By the end of her 30-year, special-operations career, the Parche had become the most decorated vessel in the U.S. Navy. The sub’s awards included nine Presidential Unit Citations, 10 Navy Unit Commendations and 13 Expeditionary Medals.

Other submarines directly involved in special-ops spying include another Mare Island-based sub, the USS Richard B. Russell (SSN-687), and in recent years the USS Jimmy Carter (SSN-23), USS Connecticut (SSN-22), and a new USS Seawolf (SSN-21). Many other Navy subs have had tasks such as providing cover or serving as decoys during secret missions.

“The special fleet of submarines equipped to tap cables made it possible to listen as Soviet naval headquarters detailed day-to-day frustrations, critiqued missions, and reacted to fears of an American nuclear strike,” Sontag and Drew wrote in Blind Man’s Bluff. “At a point in time when both superpowers could start nuclear war with a push of a button, this was a rare and crucial look at who the adversary really was.”

“There was always a huge risk of a destabilizing incident, even the risk that a submarine might spark real battle,” the authors added. “But when the Navy and the intelligence agencies weighed the gains against the possibility of a violent response, they relied on one simple fact: the Soviets were sending out their spies as well.”

“Perhaps the entire nuclear arms race was insane, but once it existed, spy subs became a crucial part of dealing with that insanity.”

The rumors are that the Navy's newest nuclear sub, the [USS Jimmy Carter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Jimmy_Carter_\(SSN-23\)), has been [designed for spywork](http://http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/20/politics/20submarine.html), with a ""special capability... to tap undersea cables and eavesdrop on the communications passing through them,"" according to the AP.  
The rumors are right, Military.com's undersea warfare experts believe. Here's what retired Rear Admiral Hank McKinney, the former commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet's submarine force, had to say:  

> _The Navy has for years carried out special surviellance missions with nuclear submarines. Most of these missions utlilized attack submarines that were not extensively modified. Specialized communications intercept equipments were installed in existing spaces on board these submarines. A few have been modified for special oceanographic missions and capabilities. In the past, these included USS HALIBUT, USS SEAWOLF, USS RICHARD B. RUSSELL, and USS PARCHE. Each of these submarines was modified to accomodate these new missions. **In the case of USS JIMMY CARTER, all of the modifications were made before the submarine was delivered to the Navy**. This submarine will be utilized to conduct many specialized missions, some of which will be routine unclassified oceanographic research operations which will advance our knowledge of the ocean. Some of the missions will be highly classified missions which I am unable to comment on._ (emphasis mine)

Undersea thriller author, submarine authority, and Military.com columnist [Joe Buff](http://www.joebuff.com/) notes that a [2001 _Wall Street Journal_ article](http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-529826.html?legacy=zdnn) unveiled the NSA's desire to tap undersea cables. ""It is reasonable to presume that \[the ability\] to do this underwater, by properly trained Navy divers, is now achievable,"" Buff writes.

> _Ironically, an earlier nuclear sub named USS Seawolf, commissioned in the 1950s, was secretly modified with a hull section that allowed saturation divers to work on the seafloor at considerable depths. (Saturation divers spend a long period living and resting in a shirtsleeves environment with a mixed-gas atmosphere pressurized to equal the depth of their job site. After days or even weeks of daily work shifts, they then undergo a long period of hyperbaric decompression to be able to return to sea-level air. France claimed several years ago to have had men in ""soft"" scuba outfits -- not hard exoskeleton suits -- perform useful manual tasks on the bottom at 3,000 feet.)  
> In my opinion USS Jimmy Carter is highly likely to include such facilities, essentially a modern-era Sea Lab built into the submarine itself._

Click [here](https://www.defensetech.org/archives/001397.html) for more, as Buff goes deep into mechanics of listening in on undersea chatter.

> _The issue of how to collect the tapped communications in real-time also isn't new. In addition to the undersea tap referenced in the \[Journal\] article, which by the way affected the Soviet Navy's Pacific Fleet headquarters and waters in the Sea of Okhotsk off the western Pacific, another tap was emplaced to listen in on Northern Fleet communications near Murmansk on the Kola Peninsula on the Barents Sea off of the North Atlantic -- this tap was not betrayed by the spy mentioned in the article, because he did not know about it. The idea was seriously discussed in the American intelligence and submarine community of laying an undersea cable from that tap to Iceland, using submarines and divers, so that a listening station could monitor the cable's message traffic continuously. Open sources state that this cable wasn't built, partly because the Cold War ended and the cost didn't seemed justified.  
> However, with technology at least fifteen years more advanced now, it is quite possible that Carter can carry within her 100-foot long, 42-foot diameter special ""wasp waist"" hull section's ""garage space"" a considerable length of fiber optic cable. (Wasp waist refers to the narrow inner pressure hull, which allows for the ocean-interface garage space volume between the pressure hull and the outer hull that conforms to the overall streamlined teardrop shape of the vessel.)  
> This hypothetical cable need not be led up onto land in friendly turf for it to be useful. It need only establish enough ""stand-off distance"" from the tap, out into neutral or international waters, where various means of transmission of intercepts are more feasible without enemy detection or interference. These include a hard-wired or acoustic-link modem station that is monitored by submarines that deploy there in rotation for Indications and Warning missions. Or, as the article says, various radio buoy transmitters and other means could be used to continually relay intercepts on to the NSA for detailed analysis. Spread-spectrum or frequency agile, super high frequency (SHF) or extremely high frequency (EHF) transmitters, with very low probability of interception, mounted on low-observable buoys, constantly ""talking"" to U.S. spy satellites, are surely within current technical means if budgeting were available.  
> These transmitters could be powered for lengthy periods using the latest generation of fuel cell or semi fuel cell technology, some types of which are open to the sea and in fact use naturally circulating seawater as their electrolyte. Such radio buoy bandwidth would be adequate to convey information from a fiber optic cable, especially given mathematical data-compression techniques and artificial intelligence routines in an attached computer that could quickly ""learn"" which cable lines and which message traffic were truly of strategic interest to the United States. (A communications laser might be used instead of a radio, just as some submarine/satellite comms links now use laser beams.)  
> It is also worth noting that the garage space and ""people tank"" facilities within Carter's added hull section are almost certainly mission reconfigurable, that is, easily altered to serve different mission profiles. This is the case with the USS Virginia design, and it appears likely that the same new, hyper-flexible approach to submarine architecture was applied to Carter's special modifications; the design and construction work of the two overlapped, witness both ships being commissioned into the Navy in 2004/2005. Thus Carter is able to do many different and exciting things with her 50 commandoes, her garage space, and her ocean interface for deploying and retrieving unmanned (and autonomous?) undersea vehicles and perhaps also aerial vehicles._

The fear, the report stipulates, is that Russia might be looking for weak spots that could be attacked and severed during a conflict.

Though the tactics and threat are reminiscent of the Cold War, the Russians appear to be taking a page out of the book that the U.S. Navy and the NSA wrote in the 1970s in a series of undersea wire-tapping missions that became known as Operation Ivy Bells.

Briefly mentioned in the Times report, Operation Ivy Bells is written about extensively in the book “Blind Man’s Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage” by Sherry Sontag and Christopher Drew. The missions used submarines to listen in on previously untapped Soviet “hard-lines” to glean information about Soviet ballistic missile submarine deployments and strategy.

In 1970, at the height of the Cold War, James Bradley, the director of undersea warfare at the Office of Naval intelligence dreamed up one of the most daring submarine spy missions in modern history. He wanted to send the specially outfitted 350ft nuclear-powered submarine, the _Halibut_, to land over the ocean floor under the Sea of Okhotsk and tap a phone line that connected the Soviet submarine base at Petropavlovsk to its Pacific Fleet headquarters near Vladivostok.

Besides the risk of international incident if _Halibut_ was caught or detected, there was no evidence that the phone line even existed. The only evidence that Bradley had was the notion that the sub base in Petropavlovsk was probably required to give constant updates back to its higher headquarters. So Bradley, sitting in his Pentagon office at 3 a.m., thought back to his childhood, racking his brain to figure out where the Soviets might have laid their cables.

According to “Blind Man’s Bluff,” Bradley, in his predawn stupor, recalled from his youth written signs that had been posted along the Mississippi River to mark undersea cables. The signs, posted along the shore, were meant to prevent passing from hooking the cables with their anchors.

With this in mind, Bradley reasoned that there had to be similar signs near the shallower points on the Sea of Okhotsk.

So, with Bradley’s childhood in mind, “the most daring acts of tele-piracy of the Cold War” was born.

After an extensive multi-year refit that began in the late 60s, _Halibut_ was ready to depart from Mare Island Naval Shipyard outside of San Francisco for Okhotsk in 1972. One of the sub’s most noticeable additions was a giant hump mounted behind its conning tower, a hump that was publicly declared as a hangar for a deep sea rescue vehicle but was actually a “decompression and lockout chamber” for the team of divers that would exit the sub to tap the Soviet cables.

So in October 1972, the crew of _Halibut_ made its way across the Pacific, its older nuclear reactor pushing her across the sea at just over 10 knots. First the spy sub moved north to the Aleutian Islands, then past the Bering Straight and into the Sea of Okhotsk. The captain of the _Halibut_, Navy Cmdr. Jack McNish, had not told the crew where it was going—only that they were leaving home for three months and that they were searching for the remnants of a new Soviet infared anti-ship missile that the United States was desperately seeking a counter-measure for.

Once inside the Sea of Okhotsk, the _Halibut_ slowly patrolled with its periscope up, scanning the coastline for Bradley’s signage that would mark the cables. And then, after a week of patrolling with no luck, the _Halibut_ found a sign on the northern shore of the Sea of Okhotsk that said something to the extent of “Do Not Anchor. Cable Here” in Russian.

The _Halibut_, after locating the sign, launched a specially designed submersible or “fish,” that then proceeded to search for the cables. The fish had a very basic video camera, and a higher definition camera. While the video was relayed in real-time back to the submarine, the film from the camera had to be retrieved from the fish and subsequently developed while the _Halibut_ was near the surface so that the sub’s dark room could properly vent or “snorkel” the chemicals used to develop the film.

Hours after the fish’s launch, footage began to come back of foot-long bumps in the sand, a sort of Morse code etched in the sea bottom. The _Halibut_ had found the cables.

According to “Blind Man’s Bluff,” the fish was then retrieved and the film developed, revealing the Soviet cables strewn along the seafloor.

After identifying the cables, McNish maneuvered the _Halibut_ well outside the 3-mile territorial limit of the Soviet Union and located a spot just above the cable where he could lower the submarine’s two massive anchors in a sort-of hover.

Using specially designed rubber wet suits that fit loosely and were pumped full of hot water to counter the freezing temperatures of the Sea of Okhotsk, the divers departed the _Halibut_ armed with pneumatic air-guns to blow debris off the cables and emergency oxygen bottles in case their “umbilical cords” that connected them back to _the Halibut_ were severed.

The wire-tap, according to “Blind Man’s Bluff,” was three-feet long and composed of a tape recorder and a lithium ion battery. A connector would wrap around the cable and draw out the words and data through induction. There was no cutting into the cable.

For the next few hours the recording device attached to the cable relayed Soviet communications back to a select group of spies aboard the _Halibut_ who would then, after the completion of the mission and a successful return to port, send the tapes to Fort Meade, Md, where they would be subsequently analyzed.

With the tap successful, the _Halibut_ then moved to its secondary mission of locating the Soviet missile fragments before returning to port. With the mission a success, Bradley saw a future filled with taps around the globe that could record for months and years continuously, without the presence of an American sub to collect the data.

In August 1972, the _Halibut_ departed once more for the Sea of Okhotsk to repeat the tap. This time, however, the sub was rigged with explosives in case the sub and her crew were ever compromised. This time too, according to Blind Man’s Bluff, McNish told his crew about their actual mission and the risks it entailed.

In the years following more submarines would be outfitted like _Halibut_, and they too would conduct similar wire-taps. Operation Ivy Bells had begun.","The article discusses Russian submarines operating near vital undersea cables, highlighting concerns about their potential severing during conflicts.

However, these pale in comparison to some of the audacious peacetime plots to get information that have emerged from the shadowy world of espionage.

At the height of the cold war, the National Security Agency, CIA and the US Navy collaborated to tap into underwater communication lines used by the Soviet Union.

They discovered an undersea cable that connected the Soviet Pacific Fleet’s headquarters at Vladivostok with a submarine base at Petropavlovsk.

Sailing deep into Soviet territorial waters in 1971, the US sent a specially modified submarine USS Halibut into the Sea of Okhotsk to examine the cable.

Divers found it under 400 feet of water and installed a device that wrapped around the cable to record all communications that passed through it.

Once a month divers retrieved the recordings and installed new tapes. It proved so successful that other taps were placed on other Soviet communication lines around the world.

The operation continued until 1981 when a bankrupt NSA agent sold details of the operation to the Soviets.

This joint operation between the CIA and the British Secret Intelligence Service was again an attempt to tap into communications by the Soviet Military.

On this occasion the target was the Soviet Army headquarters in Berlin.

In 1953, a time of high tension between the powers controlling east and west Berlin, a warehouse with a deep basement was constructed in the American sector of the divided city.

The CIA had heard of a crucial telephone junction close to the border of the American sector where three cables came together.

Striking out to reach this small target, which ran just a few inches below a busy street, a 1,500 feet long tunnel was dug from the warehouse basement, running under the most heavily patrolled border at the time.

They intersected the cables to tap into the wires, allowing them to listen to the communications between the Soviet headquarters in Berlin and Moscow.

Although they were unable to break the Soviet encryption, a faint electronic echo produced by the Soviet communication equipment allowed them to obtain the information in plain text.

The Soviets claim to have known about the tunnel all along after being tipped off by a mole in the British intelligence service.

The Soviets “discovered” the tunnel in 1956 when soldiers broke into the eastern end.

Rather than relying on modern eavesdropping, this operation used old fashioned infiltration.

Recruited while at Cambridge University by Russian spy Arnold Deutsch, Kim Philby, Donald Maclean, Guy Burgess and Anthony Blunt rose to become a ring of highly placed spies in the British establishment.

Philby joined MI6, MacLean worked at the Foreign Office, Burgess at the BBC and later MI6 and Blunt worked for MI5.

They all passed information to the Soviet Union. Philby is perhaps the most notorious, having risen to be chief British intelligence representative in Washington.

He helped alert MacLean and Burgess that they had been exposed, allowing them to escape to Moscow. Philby himself later defected.

A fifth spy John Cairncross, who worked at the Foreign Office, has also been claimed as being a member of the Cambridge spy ring.

During 1976, the KGB managed to install miniaturised eavesdropping equipment and transmitters inside 16 IBM Selectric Typewriters used by staff at the US embassy in Moscow and consulate in Leningrad.

These copied everything that was typed into the machines and then transmitted the data in bursts to KGB engineers in vans nearby.

The bursts were too short to be detected by the Us counter surveillance equipment and were set n the same frequency band as the Soviet television stations.

For eight years the Soviet spy agency was able to steal American secrets from inside the heart of the US embassy.

The bugs were only discovered in 1984 by an operation conducted by the National Security Agency when it sent a team of experts to scour the embassy for bugs.

Over 100 days every piece of electronic equipment, communications device, printers and computers were replaced while the old equipment was taken back to the US to be X-rayed.

Some of the bugs operated on batteries and others used mains electricity.

The bugs were also remote controlled so they could be turned off when inspection teams were in the area.

**[An NSA report that was later released](http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/cryptologic_histories/Learning_from_the_Enemy.pdf)** concluded that the Soviets had been able to read every single document written on these typewriters.

They never discovered how the bugs were installed, but suspected they were installed by the KGB when the typewriters were passing through Soviet customs.

**The Bundesnachrichtendienst Trojan horse affair**

Germany may have been the victim off NSA eavesdropping, but its own Federal Intelligence Service, the Bundesnachrichtendienst, has also engaged in such activities.

In 2008 it was found to have illicitly monitored the entire computer network at the Afghan Ministry of Commerce and Industry.

Using software known as a Trojan horse, the German spy agency were able to get hold of the login details for the personal Yahoo email account of Amin Farhang, the Afghani Commerce Minister.

Over several months during 2006 German spies were able to access his emails and **[those of a journalist at the newspaper Der Speigel](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/bnd-affairs-broadens-german-spies-put-afghan-ministry-under-surveillance-a-549894.html)**.

It later emerged that the agency had been able to access the entire computer network at the ministry.

In 2011 a hacking group also announced it had discovered another Trojan horse that was being used to **[monitor Skype conversations](http://www.tgdaily.com/security-features/58952-german-government-built-backdoor-trojan)**.

In a modern version of the dead letter drop, British spies working out of the embassy in Russia used a transmitter concealed in an artificial rock to pass classified data.

The rock was planted near a tree on a street on the outskirts of Moscow.

Information was transferred wirelessly to a memory device inside the fake rock by Russian assets using palm-sized devices as they walked past.

Later British diplomats from the embassy would collect the information by again walking past with a wireless device or even taking away the rock.

Russia exposed the plot and broadcast images of British diplomats repeatedly walking past the rock and picking it up on television.

The FSB, the Russian intelligence service, also released close up photographs and x-ray images of a hollowed out rock filled with circuitry.

They published photographs of four alleged British agents and a Russian accused of sending information to the rock.

The plot seemed to be far fetched enough to be worth of a James Bond film and Q. Britain initially laughed it off and denied the accusations.

However, Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair's chief of staff, **[later admitted that the episode was in fact true](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/9022827/Russian-spy-rock-was-genuine-former-chief-of-staff-admits.html)**.

Acoustic Kitty was a top secret 1960s CIA project attempting to use cats in spy missions, intended to spy on the Kremlin and Soviet embassies.

In an hour-long procedure, a veterinary surgeon transformed the furry feline into an elite spy, implanting a microphone in her ear canal and a small radio transmitter at the base of her skull.

The first Acoustic Kitty mission was to eavesdrop on two men in a park outside the Soviet compound on Wisconsin Avenue in Washington, D.C.

It cost nearly $20 million in surgical and training expenses, however the feline was hit and killed by a taxi almost immediately after being let out on her first job.","The article discusses operations where undersea cables were tapped for espionage during the Cold War.

These cables use fiber optics to move data at high speeds to land, where the data is then conveyed via fiber optics to homes and businesses.

Yet, despite the billions of people relying on the data moved by undersea cables, there are only about 380 of them worldwide as of 2019, according to CNN estimates, though they span more than 745,000 miles—or more than three times the distance to the moon.

Given the sheer scope of undersea cables, which often span entire oceans, _The New York Times_ estimates an individual undersea cable project can cost up to $350 million. That is why these cables have historically been laid by global telecommunications firms with the deep pockets and technical expertise necessary to undertake these projects. However, tech companies are increasingly dominating both the use and implementation of undersea cables.

“Some of the main investors in new cables now are Google and Facebook,” says Alan Maudlin, research director at TeleGeography, a telecommunications research firm, because tech giants are increasingly the ones using all that undersea bandwidth.

When it comes to global bandwidth usage, just a handful of services account for more than a third of all bandwidth, according to research from network intelligence company Sandvine. The company’s Global Internet Phenomena Report identifies Web-based media streaming, Netflix, and YouTube as the top three users of global traffic, comprising 34.1% of traffic as of September 2019. Facebook is also in the top 10.

Tech giants like Google (which owns YouTube) and Facebook “have surpassed Internet backbone providers—the traditional telecom carriers—as the largest users of international capacity,” according to TeleGeography. The firm estimates the amount of international capacity deployed by tech companies grew eight times from 2014 to 2018.

These undersea cables connect almost the entire globe. Google is a part or sole owner of 15 different undersea cables, with endpoints terminating in places that include Chile and France. Facebook is a major capacity buyer or part owner of 10 cables with endpoints in Singapore, China, and the U.S. (among other countries). Amazon is part owner or a major capacity buyer of five cables, with endpoints in countries that include Malaysia. Microsoft is part owner or a major capacity buyer of four different cables, with endpoints in countries that include Spain.

One of the fastest undersea cables in operation today is the Marea cable, partially owned by Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook. It transmits data at 160 terabits per second, which is “16 million times faster than the average home Internet connection,” says Microsoft. The Marea cable has enough capacity to “stream 71 million high-definition videos simultaneously,” according to the company.

Despite this ongoing change in cable dominance, undersea cables often force traditional telecoms and the new guard of tech giants to play nice.

The Marea cable is the result of a partnership between Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, and Telxius, a spinoff that manages telecom infrastructure for multinational telecom Telefonica. That is because advanced cables like Marea are critical to meeting rising demand from the consumers and businesses both telecoms and tech giants serve.

“Marea comes at a critical time,” says Microsoft president Brad Smith. “Submarine cables in the Atlantic already carry 55% more data than transpacific routes, and 40% more data than between the U.S. and Latin America.” Smith says there is “no question” demand for trans-Atlantic data flows will increase.

“Only Google has built/funded cables themselves, but even these cables are used by other parties besides Google,” says Maudlin. “For example, the new Dunant cable [owned by Google] between the U.S. and France will have a fiber pair used by the French carrier Orange.”

Tech giants may battle each other for Internet dominance, all while replacing old guard telecoms, but when it comes to laying undersea cable, playing nice seems to be the order of the day.

### More Fibers in More Places

Companies may collaborate to build undersea cable networks, but they still must defend these networks from threats. Damage to a single cable can cause widespread disruption. In fact, the potential for cable outages was actually the reason Microsoft helped to create the super-fast Marea cable.

In 2012, Hurricane Sandy (also known as Superstorm Sandy) hit the east coast of the U.S., inflicting nearly $70 billion in damage to the infrastructure of New York and New Jersey. In addition to the homes and businesses damaged, the storm also damaged the places where undersea cables came ashore, causing service disruptions. Microsoft learned the hard way that New York and New Jersey were home to an unnaturally high convergence of undersea cables making landfall.

That made Microsoft think differently about potential dangers to undersea cables, both below the surface and on land. Today, the Marea cable makes landfall in the U.S. much further south, in Virginia Beach, VA, to avoid disruption if New York or New Jersey ever get hit by a storm of Sandy’s magnitude again.

Being more strategic about where cables make landfall certainly helps. So does building the cables to withstand physical damage and destruction. The fiber optics of undersea cables are wrapped in protective material to withstand harsh underwater environments, natural disasters like submarine earthquakes, and man-made damage from fishing boats and anchors.

Typically, “the fibers are wrapped in urethane and wrapped in copper and wrapped again in urethane,” said Byron Clatterbuck, CEO of international telecom company Seacom. The urethane protects the optical fibers, and the copper conducts electricity that powers repeaters designed to regenerate the signal regularly through the cable. Depending on the environment, cables may also be sheathed in extra protective material, such as iron or steel.

The number of undersea cables being laid is increasing to meet demand, but cables still take years and millions of dollars to lay, which puts a ceiling on how many companies can lay cable at a time to expand global bandwidth. That fact has companies exploring ways to get more out of each cable laid.

“One key development is space-division multiplexing,” says Maudlin. “It’s basically a method to increase the number of [spatially distinct] channels that can be put in a single fiber. Google is using this in their new Dunant cable between France and the U.S.”

Dunant, which Google says is scheduled to go live this year, will use space-division multiplexing to provide transmission capacity of 250 terabits of data per second. The search giant says that is enough bandwidth to “transmit the entire digitized Library of Congress three times every second.”

In the case of Dunant, which Google is building in tandem with telecom SubCom LLC, the companies are using an approach to space-division multiplexing in which the cable doubles the fiber pairs used from six pairs to 12. The power transmitted across the original six pairs would now be split, resulting in a “two-thirds capacity increase,” according to Georg Mohs, CTO of SubCom LLC.

The technologies incorporated into newer cables like Dunant will make older cables look like dinosaurs—and cause them to go extinct.

“New cables have higher potential capacities than older cables,” says Maudlin. “Eventually older cables, especially those built pre-2003, will be decommissioned as they become economically obsolete compared to higher-capacity cables.”

However, older cables do not always make it to a peaceful retirement. Natural and man-made events can damage or destroy undersea cables.

“Cables routinely have faults all over the world each week,” says Maudlin. He cites some of the primary causes of damage as fishing and anchors. Underwater earthquakes and landslides also can destroy or disrupt undersea cables, he says.

Cable disruption also can affect military operations, as occurred in 2008, when three of the world’s largest undersea cables, in the Mediterranean Sea, were severed by accident. The incident was described in a report by U.K. think tank Policy Exchange that observed, “In a matter of hours, disruptions to regional connectivity had knocked out 80% of the connectivity between Europe and the Middle East,” including communications for American and British military forces in Iraq that were enabled by these cables.

That incident suggests another potential danger to undersea cables: intentional sabotage. Coordinated cable destruction, notes Policy Exchange, could cause major disruptions that target specific nations. For example, cutting just three cables would cause India to lose 70% of its data traffic with Europe. “Cables are not only easily cut, but maps providing the exact locations of all the world’s commercial cabling are freely available in the public domain.”

In mid-2019, a fire broke out on a Russian AS-12 nuclear-powered submarine, killing 14 sailors. It was a tragedy, to be sure. However, the incident also put U.S. officials on edge; they claimed the submarine’s real mission before the fire broke out was to cut undersea cables to disrupt or intercept communications.","The article 'How the Internet Spans the Globe' discusses undersea cables extensively, including their significance in global communications and the implications of their damage.

The Russian research vessel Yantar is shown docked in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Russian ships are skulking around underwater communications cables, worrying the U.S. and its allies the Kremlin might be taking information warfare to new depths.  

WASHINGTON (AP) — Russian ships are skulking around underwater communications cables, causing the U.S. and its allies to worry the Kremlin might be taking information warfare to new depths.  

Is Moscow interested in cutting or tapping the cables? Does it want the West to worry it might? Is there a more innocent explanation? Unsurprisingly, Russia isn’t saying.  

But whatever Moscow’s intentions, U.S. and Western officials are increasingly troubled by their rival’s interest in the 400 fiber-optic cables that carry most of world’s calls, emails and texts, as well as $10 trillion worth of daily financial transactions.  

“We’ve seen activity in the Russian navy, and particularly undersea in their submarine activity, that we haven’t seen since the ’80s,” Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of the U.S. European Command, told Congress this month.  

Without undersea cables, a bank in Asian countries couldn’t send money to Saudi Arabia to pay for oil. U.S. military leaders would struggle to communicate with troops fighting extremists in Afghanistan and the Middle East. A student in Europe wouldn’t be able to Skype his parents in the United States.  

All this information is transmitted along tiny glass fibers encased in undersea cables that, in some cases, are little bigger than a garden hose. All told, there are 620,000 miles of fiber-optic cable running under the sea, enough to loop around the earth nearly 25 times.  

Most lines are owned by private telecommunications companies, including giants like Google and Microsoft. Their locations are easily identified on public maps, with swirling lines that look like spaghetti. While cutting one cable might have limited impact, severing several simultaneously or at choke points could cause a major outage.  

The Russians “are doing their homework and, in the event of a crisis or conflict with them, they might do rotten things to us,” said Michael Kofman, a Russian military expert at nonprofit research group CNA Corp.  

It’s not Moscow’s warfighting ships and submarines that are making NATO and U.S. officials uneasy. It’s Russia’s Main Directorate of Deep Sea Research, whose specialized surface ships, submarines, underwater drones and mini subs conduct reconnaissance, underwater salvage and other work.  

One ship run by the directorate is the Yantar. It’s a modest, 354-foot oceanographic vessel that holds a crew of about 60. It most recently was off South America’s coast helping Argentina search for a lost submarine.  

Parlamentskaya Gazeta, the Russian parliament’s publication, last October said the Yantar has equipment “designed for deep-sea tracking” and “connecting to top-secret communication cables.” The publication said that in September 2015, the Yantar was near Kings Bay, Georgia, home to a U.S. submarine base, “collecting information about the equipment on American submarines, including underwater sensors and the unified (U.S. military) information network.” Rossiya, a Russian state TV network, has said the Yantar can not only connect to top-secret cables, but could cut them and “jam underwater sensors with a special system.”  

Russia’s Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.  

There is no hard evidence that the ship is engaged in nefarious activity, said Steffan Watkins, an information technology security consultant in Canada tracking the ship. But he wonders what the ship is doing when it’s stopped over critical cables or when its Automatic Identification System tracking transponder isn’t on.  

Of the Yantar’s crew, he said: “I don’t think these are the actual guys who are doing any sabotage. I think they’re laying the groundwork for future operations.”  

Members of Congress are wondering, too.  

Rep. Joe Courtney, a Connecticut Democrat on a House subcommittee on sea power, said of the Russians, “The mere fact that they are clearly tracking the cables and prowling around the cables shows that they are doing something.”  

Democratic Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, an Armed Services Committee member, said Moscow’s goal appears to be to “disrupt the normal channels of communication and create an environment of misinformation and distrust.”  

The Yantar’s movements have previously raised eyebrows.  

On Oct. 18, 2016, a Syrian telecom company ordered emergency maintenance to repair a cable in the Mediterranean that provides internet connectivity to several countries, including Syria, Libya and Lebanon. The Yantar arrived in the area the day before the four-day maintenance began. It left two days before the maintenance ended. It’s unknown what work it did while there.  

Watkins described another episode on Nov. 5, 2016, when a submarine cable linking Persian Gulf nations experienced outages in Iran. Hours later, the Yantar left Oman and headed to an area about 60 miles west of the Iranian port city of Bushehr, where the cable runs ashore. Connectivity was restored just hours before the Yantar arrived on Nov. 9. The boat stayed stationary over the site for several more days.  

Undersea cables have been targets before.  

At the beginning of World War I, Britain cut a handful of German underwater communications cables and tapped the rerouted traffic for intelligence. In the Cold War, the U.S. Navy sent American divers deep into the Sea of Okhotsk off the Russian coast to install a device to record Soviet communications, hoping to learn more about the USSR’s submarine-launched nuclear capability.  

More recently, British and American intelligence agencies have eavesdropped on fiber optic cables, according to documents released by Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor.  

In 2007, Vietnamese authorities confiscated ships carrying miles of fiber optic cable that thieves salvaged from the sea for profit. The heist disrupted service for several months. And in 2013, Egyptian officials arrested three scuba divers off Alexandria for attempting to cut a cable stretching from France to Singapore. Five years on, questions remain about the attack on a cable responsible for about a third of all internet traffic between Egypt and Europe.  

Despite the relatively few publicly known incidents of sabotage, most outages are due to accidents.  

Two hundred or so cable-related outages take place each year. Most occur when ship anchors snap cables or commercial fishing equipment snags the lines. Others break during tsunamis, earthquakes and other natural disasters.  

But even accidental cuts can harm U.S. military operations.  

In 2008 in Iraq, unmanned U.S. surveillance flights nearly screeched to a halt one day at Balad Air Base not because of enemy mortar attacks or dusty winds. An anchor had snagged a cable hundreds of miles away from the base, situated in the “Sunni Triangle” northwest of Baghdad.  

The severed cable had linked controllers based in the United States with unmanned aircraft flying intelligence, surveillance and recognizance missions for coalition forces in the skies over Iraq, explained Ret. Air Force Col. Dave Lujan of Hampton, Virginia.

"Operation Ivy Bells: The Secret Mission to Tap Soviet Undersea Cables","Explores the covert operation that successfully intercepted Soviet military communications via undersea cables, revealing critical intelligence strategies.","https://www.military.com/history/operation-ivy-bells.html","2022-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","Military.com",Yes,"Military.com","San Francisco, CA, US","5000","2022-06-29","English","Military.com","At the beginning of the 1970s, divers from the specially equipped submarine, USS Halibut (SSN 587), left their decompression chamber to start a bold and dangerous mission, codenamed ""Ivy Bells.""

Nearly 400 feet beneath the frigid waters of the Sea of Okhotsk, deep inside Soviet territorial waters, the divers stayed alive only by the umbilical cords that pumped warm water into their dive suits.

In an effort to alter the balance of the Cold War, these men scoured the ocean floor for a five-inch diameter cable carrying secret Soviet communications between military bases.

Capt. James Bradley conceived the mission and firmly believed that he could find the tiny Soviet cable under the immense expanse of the ocean. Bradley remembered the signs that he saw during his childhood along the Mississippi River, warning boaters not to anchor near cables. He rationalized that the Soviets would use similar signs and lead him right to his target. Bradley's theory proved correct when the Halibut located a series of such signs in the Northern part of the Sea of Okhotsk, after an arduous search.

The divers found the cable and installed a 20-foot-long listening device on it. Designed to attach to the cable without piercing the casing, the device recorded all communications that occurred. If the cable malfunctioned and the Soviets raised it for repair, the bug, by design, would fall to the bottom of the ocean. Each month, Navy divers retrieved the recordings and installed a new set of tapes.

Upon their return to the United States, intelligence agents from the National Security Agency (NSA) analyzed the recordings and tried to decipher any encrypted information. The Soviets apparently were confident in the security of their communications lines, as a surprising amount of sensitive information traveled through the lines without encryption.

The Americans continued their operations undetected until 1981, when one day, surveillance satellites showed a number of Soviet warships, including a salvage ship, anchored over the undersea cable. Another intelligence-capable submarine, USS Parche (SSN-683), was quickly sent to the site to retrieve the pod. Unable to find the tap, the Parche's divers realized that the Soviets had discovered the operation. The submarine made it back to the United States safely, leaving American leaders to determine how the Soviets had suddenly detected the tap.

After a long probe, U.S. counterintelligence agents determined an NSA employee, Ronald Pelton, betrayed Operation Ivy Bells to the Soviets. He sold the secret of Operation Ivy Bells for $35,000, which ended nearly a decade of espionage. Pelton was later convicted and sentenced to life in prison. The original tap that was discovered by the Soviets is now on exhibit at the KGB museum in Moscow.","The article discusses Operation Ivy Bells, which involved locating and tapping into a Soviet undersea cable used for military communications.

Today, a complex mesh of hundreds of cables, stretching over one million kilometres, connects nearly every corner of the earth and is instrumental in closing the remaining connectivity gaps. Despite the scale and critical role of the submarine network for both business and society at large, our community has mostly ignored it, treating it as a black box in most Internet studies, from connectivity to inter-domain traffic and reliability.

While there are benefits to this kind of abstraction, particularly for application developers, it does create roadblocks for network operators and researchers trying to gain insights into the underlying infrastructure. Both groups rely on diagnostic and measurement tools, such as traceroute, that record observations at the network layer. Despite their undeniable value, the level of abstraction at which they work means that multiple network operators sharing the same physical path may appear as distinct paths at the network layer.

In reality, a failure in one piece of infrastructure could result in simultaneous failures in many seemingly disparate IP connections. With approximately 400 submarine cables being responsible for carrying 99% of transoceanic traffic, a relatively small number of conduits (with long repair times) bear a lot of responsibility for ensuring global bandwidth and connectivity. Simultaneous outages on just a few of these links can result in large regions being cut off entirely from the Internet. This difference between what our tools reveal and the underlying infrastructure can lead us to overestimate the network’s resiliency.

We first became interested in this area a few years back when looking at the connectivity of Cuba. We noticed four different networks being used to access the island – Tata, Telefonica, and two satellite providers. By examining our latency measurements, we knew that Tata and Telefonica were sending traffic via submarine cables instead of a satellite connection. However, both operators shared a single cable (ALBA-1) to reach the island, so relying solely on IP-level measurements would have led us to overestimate the number of physical paths by a factor of two. Most submarine cables are shared by many more than two providers.

When we first started discussing our research with the community, we found that there was a lot of interest from organizations aiming to operate reliable services over the Internet but did not have the global presence of larger networks like those of Google, Amazon, Microsoft, or Facebook. Organizations using these smaller networks want to ensure that if they are hiring another transit provider to improve reliability that it will actually lead to an increase in redundancy. While a second operator may help protect against certain types of issues (that is, non-physical faults such as configuration issues), cable faults will affect both operators.

At the moment, we are working on a service that will take an Internet path (a series of IP addresses such as the output of traceroute), and tag hops with possible submarine cables, identifying the most likely cable. We hope that eventually operators will be able to use this service to evaluate the path independence of their transit providers.

Being able to accurately tag an IP hop to a physical cable is not an easy process. Using over 500 million traceroutes, collected by the RIPE Atlas project, as well as using RIPE’s geolocation service, we were able to calculate whether it was physically possible for IP hops to traverse known submarine cables. We are also working to correlate cable outage and reconfiguration information to improve the accuracy and completeness of our data. For example, the below figures demonstrate the impact of an outage or cable reconfiguration on round-trip time (RTT).

The hope is that this data can be updated as Atlas probes continue to run measurements.

While there are faults and outages in terrestrial settings that can result in performance degradation or disconnections for large groups of users, the impact of submarine cable outages can be particularly devastating. First, relative to terrestrial networks, an even larger population — in some cases, entire economies — rely on a smaller number of conduits for connectivity.

Additionally, performance degradation caused by rerouting traffic can be even more extreme. In multiple cases in our study, we saw latency measurements between two regions increase more than threefold. Finally, depending on where the cable fault occurs and ship schedules, repair times can be measured in weeks. Though outages occur more frequently on land, the impact in terms of performance, the number of impacted users, and the repair times are more distressing.

One of the reasons why organizations like Microsoft and Google are investing in submarine infrastructure is due to a lack of reliability. While there are many additional motivations, such as better control over the network, higher reliability and predictability seem to be a critical factor. Smaller organizations without the resources to invest in their own submarine infrastructure may be interested in better information and subsea cable operators working to improve their service reliability.

While preventing submarine outages is a high bar, we can certainly gain a better understanding of critical infrastructure and recurrent problems with a more systemic perspective. While we have come across various reports of previous outages, a more complete compilation of outages that we can cross reference with other data sets covering natural disasters (such as earthquakes), ship routes, and cable repair times will allow us to more accurately assess the likelihood and potential impact of prolonged outages. It will also aid in identifying specific regions and cables where further investment may be the most beneficial.","The article discusses submarine cables extensively, including their critical role in global connectivity and the implications of outages.

It directly mentions specific incidents of cable failures, such as the SEA-ME-WE-3 cable break, and elaborates on the consequences of such failures, indicating that the topic of cut sea cables is treated as a central theme.

This aligns with the criterion requirements."
"The Cable Ties to China’s Digital Silk Road","Examines the geopolitical impact of undersea cables, highlighting incidents of disruption linked to Chinese vessels and their significance for global internet connectivity.","https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/cable-ties-china-s-digital-silk-road","2019-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","Sadia Rahman",Yes,"Sadia Rahman","Sydney, Australia",-,"2019-05-14","English","Lowy Institute","Technological competition between the United States and China is transforming the physical connections that make up the digital world and its governance. China’s “Belt and Road Initiative” eventually incorporated digital connectivity under the rubric Digital Silk Road in an effort to leverage Beijing’s technological footprint globally. By developing bilateral and multilateral cooperation in areas such as cross-border optical fibre networks, satellite tracking ground stations, data centres, 5G network services and other initiatives, China’s President Xi Jinping claims that the Digital Silk Road offers an inclusive digital economy for all.

But contrary to Xi’s claims, the expansion of undersea cable networks across the Indo-Pacific region under the Digital Silk Road offers distinct advantages to China far more than bridging digital gaps. This includes accessing a large pool of foreign data, facilitating the expansion of Chinese technology corporations in the region, and strengthening China’s influence over global technology standards regimes.

Chinese technology corporation Huawei Marine Networks (now rebranded as HMN Technologies) is at the forefront of advancing the construction of undersea cable networks in the Indo-Pacific. According to the Submarine Almanac report 2023, HMN Technologies was involved in 16 undersea cable projects, which are collectively worth US$1.6 billion, across 27 countries in the region. Another report from the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) claims Beijing to have completed 11 undersea cable projects in Indonesia, seven in South Korea and six in the United Arab Emirates. In roughly the past decade, HMN Technologies has completed 108 projects laying down 60,000 kilometres of undersea cable, a total that is roughly one-and-a-half times the distance around Earth at the equator. Thanks to considerable patronage from the Chinese state, HMN Technologies has emerged as the fastest growing subsea cable builder over the past decade, ranking the company as the world’s fourth largest corporation involved in the submarine cable industry after SubCom (United States), Alcatel Submarine Network (France) and NEC (Japan).

The protection of undersea cables is a grey area under international law, and China has shown itself to be adept at exploiting the grey zone.

Reuters news agency has also reported that another three of China’s big technology corporations – China Telecom, China Unicom and China Mobile – are investing US$500 million to build a subsea cable network traversing through Europe, the Middle East and Asia.

The expansion of Chinese companies in undersea cable networks would be less remarkable if not for simmering regional tension about China’s actions. Control over data transmission lines leads to inevitable concern about China’s potential to conduct military espionage activities, or for the cables themselves to become a point of contest.

In February last year, for example, Chinese vessels disrupted two undersea cables connected to Taiwan’s Matsu Island, leaving residents without internet connectivity. While the incident was said to be unintentional, it demonstrated China’s capability to harm Taiwan’s digital security in the event of military conflict. A Chinese vessel was also blamed for severing fibre optic cables in the Baltic sea last year.

China is acting to ensure its own connectivity. China has gained permanent access to landing stations across the Indo-Pacific, such as the Pakistan and East Africa Connecting Europe (PEACE) cable, worth US$425 million, owned by China-ASEAN Information Harbor Co, PEACE Cable International Network and Telecom Egypt, spanning Pakistan, Egypt, Maldives, Cyprus, Seychelles and Djibouti. But these also provides a redundancy in case of disputes elsewhere, in particular the South China Sea. China, under the guise of its disputed nine-dash line claim, has already withheld permits for companies seeking undersea cable projects, such as the experience with Sea-Me-We.

The protection of undersea cables is a grey area under international law, and China has shown itself to be adept at exploiting the grey zone. It is important for the international community agree legal mechanisms to safeguard undersea cables, whether controlled by Chinese companies or any other.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, including direct references to incidents involving disruptions caused by Chinese vessels, which directly relate to the topic of cut sea cables.

"Operation Ivy Bells: U.S. Secret Program Wiretapping Soviet Undersea Cable","Explores a top-secret operation involving wiretapping a Soviet undersea cable, showcasing innovative techniques and Cold War espionage tactics.","https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/operation-ivy-bells-the-us-top-secret-program-that-wiretapped-a-soviet-undersea-cable","2019-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","Marcia Wendorf",Yes,"Marcia Wendorf","New York, NY, USA",-,"2019-08-17","English","Interesting Engineering","An audacious plan allowed the U.S. to wiretap a secret Soviet undersea communication cable for almost ten years.

To ensure that their sovereignty wasn’t violated, the Soviet Navy installed a network of sound detection devices on the seafloor that was designed to detect intruders.

His first challenge was to find a way to pay for a mission to find and tap the cable. In 1970, the U.S. Navy was working on a deep-submergence rescue vehicle (DSRV) program, which was a vehicle that could rescue submariners in the event of an accident. The Navy diverted funds from this program, and outfitted the Halibut with something that looked like a DSRV vehicle, but was actually what’s known as a diver lockout, and was called the “Bat Cave”.

Bradley’s second challenge was to figure out a way for divers to stay at a depth of 400 feet for the several hours that it would take to install a wiretap on the cable. His answer was helium.

At the surface, we breathe a mixture of approximately 80 percent nitrogen and 20 percent oxygen. Since the 1950s, U.S. Navy Captain George F. Bond had been experimenting with gases that would allow divers to reach much deeper depths and stay for longer periods.

When the nitrogen and oxygen in our blood are compressed by water pressure, the nitrogen builds up in the blood, causing the dangerous condition called nitrogen narcosis, decompression sickness, or the bends, and fatal embolisms result if decompression is done too quickly.

Instead of breathing nitrogen, participants in Operation Ivy Bells would breathe helium along with oxygen. This was one of the first uses of saturation diving. Because helium has a lower molecular weight than nitrogen, it exits human tissues more quickly, and that made it perfect for the task.

Bradley’s third challenge was finding the Soviet cable in over 600,000 square miles (over 1.55 million square kilometers) of water. The answer came to him while he was remembering his boyhood on the Mississippi River. He remembered signs being posted on the shore warning boaters not to anchor because there were utility lines at the bottom of the river. Bradley reasoned that if they used those signs in America, the Russians would use something similar.

Sure enough, when Halibut reached the Sea of Okhotsk in October 1971, her sailors scanned the shoreline and found signs warning fishermen to avoid the area where the cable was sunk. The Soviets never realized that enemy subs could get close enough to read the signs or would have the technology to send divers walking on a bottom that deep. Once the search area was narrowed, it took just a few days to find the cable.

Bradley’s fourth challenge was how to actually tap into the cable without shorting it out. His answer was induction. A 20-foot (6.1m) long device was designed to wrap around the 5-inch-wide (12.7 cm) cable without piercing its casing. Also, the device was designed to automatically fall off if the cable was ever raised for repair.

He also needed a way to separate the channels so someone could understand what was being communicated. Exactly how this was accomplished is still classified, but it has been reported that the technicians essentially worked out the method on the spot, jerry-rigging equipment to separate signals and drew out particular voices.

The mission was so successful that a nuclear-powered tap that could store a year’s worth of data was created for the Navy by AT&T’s Bell Laboratories, and additional submarines began monitoring Soviet undersea cables around the world. For almost ten years, everything was going swimmingly (pun intended), then disaster struck.

In January 1980, a 44-year-old employee of the NSA named Ronald Pelton realized he was seriously in debt. Pelton walked into the Soviet embassy in Washington, D.C., and over the next five years, he sold information to the Soviets about signals intelligence, including information on Operation Ivy Bells, for a total of 35,000 dollars, plus expenses.

The U.S. was taken by surprise when, in 1981, U.S. surveillance satellites showed a flotilla of Soviet ships, including a salvage vessel, sitting right above the site of the wiretap. The submarine USS Parche was dispatched to recover the tap, but they found that the Soviets had already taken it. As of 1999, the wiretap device was on public display at the Great Patriotic War Museum in Moscow.

In July 1985, the reason that the tap had been discovered was revealed when Pelton’s contact, a KGB colonel named Vitaly Yurchenko, defected to America. Yurchenko told U.S. agents about Pelton’s espionage, which led to Pelton’s arrest and 30-year jail sentence. He was released in 2015.","The article discusses Operation Ivy Bells, which involved wiretapping a Soviet undersea communication cable.

Sanctions imposed on Russia in June 2018 have targeted a Russian mini-submarine builder associated with cable-tampering operations.

In 2018 reports have multiplied in the United States and Europe that Russian has intensified its submarine activity around the undersea cables which are essential for the global operation of the internet.

Yes, you heard that right—the ability of an American user to access a website in Europe or vice versa largely depends upon a network of several hundred distinct armored, fiber-optic Submarine Communication Cables that run across around six hundred thousand miles of ocean floor—and Moscow is dispatching mini submarines apparently to tamper with them.

Washington is reportedly plenty worried about this fact, but can’t exactly get on its high horse about this activity, as U.S. submarines actually pioneered the art of tapping into submarine cables decades earlier. In fact, the USS Jimmy Carter, one of only three super-advanced Sea Wolf class submarines built, has been specially modified to perform such missions.

The first undersea cables established telegraph communications between the UK and France in 1850, followed by a trans-Atlantic cable in 1858. The [history of cable-tampering](http://gentleseas.blogspot.com/2015/10/undersea-cable-cutting-for-dummies.html) dates all the way back to the [Spanish American war](https://warontherocks.com/2015/11/silencing-the-enemy-cable-cutting-in-the-spanish-american-war/) 120 years ago when the United States cut cables connecting Madrid with Spanish outposts in the Philippines, Puerto Rico and Cuba—the operation in Guantanamo Bay undertaken while battling nearby Spanish ground and naval forces!

Trans-oceanic cables were also cut by belligerents on all sides during World War I (when submarines first entered the global cable sabotage role) and II. Even in peacetime, undersea cables lack much in the way of formal protection under international law as they do not formally belong to any one nation.

It’s not exactly clear what the Russian submarines, under the direction of the Russian Navy’s Directorate of Deep Sea Research (GUGI) are doing with the cables—or what they’re capable of doing. Tapping into the cables requires exotic techniques to access the delicate fibers inside the cable without exposing them to seawater. The Jimmy Carter reportedly uses a special floodable chamber to perform this operation. No Russian ships are confirmed to have such a capability, but Russian media sources have claimed a capability to hack into the cables.

Sabotage would be simpler to perform, but difficult to scale up for meaningful effect. This is because networks are designed with a high degree of redundancy as cables are routinely damaged by falling anchors, sharks (yes, really!), fishing lines, earthquakes, human mischief makers and so forth. Cable breaks average fifty per year in the Atlantic alone. If a few of the cables go down, data requests are simply shunted to other cables while a fleet of specially appointed, repair boats cruise over and repair the breakages.

It would therefore take a coordinated, massed attack to truly cripple the trans-Atlantic cables—a feat that experts claim is logistically impractical. Even in that event, satellite communications (though more vulnerable to interception) could be used for vital tasks, though a genuine massive cable shutdown would indeed cripple trans-Atlantic web access, with major spillover effects on the economy and financial sector.

If you glance at the global cable network at this [site](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/), though, you can see just how extensive the redundancies are between Europe and the United States—but may also note that some countries are not so well connected.

Such geographically isolated countries, and specific military or even industrial sites (think oil platforms) may be more vulnerable to sabotage. For example, Vietnam had internet access crippled for months in 2007 when fishermen pulled up one of the country’s two undersea cables with their fishing line. A targeted cable attack could be used for operational effect in a specific region as well.

In fact, it’s possible that Russia’s true target are the Pentagon’s secret DoDIN cable network distinct from the publicly accessible civilian system. These would have less redundancy than civilian cables and could disable key communication capabilities during a crisis. Already, an accidental cable outage in 2008 crippled U.S. drone operations over Iraq for several days.

NATO also maintains an undersea network called the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) for monitoring the movements of submarines—the sabotaging of which would facilitate Russian submarine operations. (China incidentally has begun building its own ‘Underwater Great Wall’, starting with listening posts near Micronesia and the southern tip of the Marianna Trench.) After decades of neglect, the Pentagon has [begun upgrading](https://thediplomat.com/2016/11/us-navy-upgrading-undersea-sub-detecting-sensor-network/) the system.

At any rate, Russia has deployed increasing number of special-operations oriented mini-submarines to facilitate it clandestine cable activities. Some operate from a secret base in the Arctic Kola Peninsula, and others are based upon an ‘oceanographic research vessel’ called the Yantar. (Again, this kind of obvious fiction was also used by the U.S. Navy during the Cold War with ships like the [USS Pueblo](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/1968-north-korea-captured-tortured-81-us-sailors-they-kept-19898).)

The Yantar carries two three person mini-submarines Rus and Consul, which can dive down to six thousand meters—allowing them to reach very deep cables—and may store additional submarines or unmanned submersibles in its huge hangar. Submarine expert HI Sutton at Covert Shores has helpfully [mapped out](http://www.hisutton.com/Yantar.html) how the Yantar’s activities clearly follow undersea cables near Cuba, Turkey, and the U.S. nuclear ballistic missile submarine base at King’s Baby, Georgia (likely scouting for secret U.S. military cables). A second Yantar-class vessel is scheduled to enter service in 2020.

Another one of Russia’s one-of-a-kind Special Operations subs is the sixty or seventy-four-meter long Losharik (named after a cartoon horse) which is powered by a nuclear reactor and can reportedly dive as deep as twenty-five hundred meters under the sea. Most military submarines can only safely dive between two hundred to five hundred meters. Appearing more conventional from the outside, Losharik’s interior is built out of seven six-meter diameter spherical compartments to better withstand pressure. The short-range Losharik is hauled into position by the much larger [Podmovskovye mothership submarine](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/russias-super-secret-spy-submarine-returns-sea-18171) converted from the Delta-class nuclear-powered attack submarine K-64. The converted Delta-class Orenburg is also capable of deploying mini-submarines, and an additional Oscar-class submarine is being converted to this purpose.

The U.S. has begun responding to the threat, with 2018 defense budget authorizing construction of a second cable-laying/repair ship costing $250 million to supplement the only one currently in U.S. military service, the USS Zeus. Sanctions imposed on Russia in June 2018 have targeted a Russian mini-submarine builder associated with cable-tampering operations. A newly formed joint-U.S./Europe Atlantic Command will also strengthen NATO’s ability to monitor submarine activities. A logical additional step would be to strengthen international law around cables to make the act of cutting them more transgressive in a non-wartime context.

Generally speaking, fear of a massive cable attack is probably over-hyped at least for a country with as may redundant cables as the United States pitted against a limited number of Russian special operations submarines. Furthermore, spying and attacks on cables have abundant historical precedents.

Nonetheless, the extensive Russian military activity around the submarine cables surely reveals that they are perceived as a valuable avenue for asymmetric attack and intelligence gathering, and a capacity to launch a more targeted attack against selected cables could cause significant disruptions.

Kissinger chair and Senior Vice-President Kathleen H. Hicks.

Among the many topics and conclusions in the paper was that Russia was engaged in a massive effort in the Baltic and Norwegian Seas to intimidate the smaller powers in the area. One of their main efforts there and world-wide is the deep ocean interception of intelligence through the tapping of trans-ocean undersea communications cables.

An aerial starboard bow view of a Soviet Golf II class ballistic missile submarine underway.

On June 12th, the day of the Trump-Kim Jong Un meeting, CNN reported on the Russian effort to intercept undersea communication as a reason for new economic sanctions by the USA against certain Russian individuals and institutions. It seems the Russians are finding new ways to gather information.

Only it’s not so new. The United States was engaged in the same type of intelligence gathering in the 1970’s, using cutting edge technologies – some of which are still classified. The information gleaned by these US efforts was instrumental in American understanding of not only Russian military preparedness and plans, but of Soviet command and control and the state of both the Soviet military and the Soviet political hierarchy.

“Operation Ivy Bells” was the brain-child of US Navy Captain James Bradley, a WWII submarine veteran and chief of Naval Undersea Intelligence in the late 1960’s/early 1970’s. By 1971, Bradley had successfully pitched his ideas to the then unknown and ultra-secret National Security Agency (NSA). The submarine chosen for the project, SSGN-587 USS Halibut, would secretly enter Soviet waters in the Sea of Okhotsk in the Russian Far East.

View of Halibut departing San Francisco, likely in the mid 1970s.

The Sea of Okhotsk was chosen for a number of reasons. First, it was the naval link between the Soviet Pacific Fleet’s base at Petropavlovsk on the Kamchatka Peninsula, and the Fleet’s headquarters on the Russian mainland at Vladivostok.

Much of the Sea of Okhotsk was off limits to civilian fishing or other vessels, and was heavily patrolled and monitored by sound detecting underwater devices. For all of those reasons (which, summed up, meant that the area was ultra-important to the Soviets and likely to contain deeply held secrets), the area of the Sea of Okhotsk was chosen by Bradley, the Navy and the NSA.

The Halibut (and later other subs) were disguised as deep-water rescue and research vessels for any prying eyes. Their hulls and propulsion systems were made ultra quiet. On their hulls were mounted fake “deep-submergence rescue vehicles” or “DSRV’s” that would normally have indicated a rescue/research vehicle. These were actually diving ports, or lock-outs from which navy divers would exit.

DSRV-1 (Mystic) docked to a Los Angeles-class attack submarine.

The divers themselves were among the first in the world to utilize some of the new breathing science that deep water divers use today. At 400 feet (the depth at which the Soviet cable was found), divers using a typical SCUBA oxygen supply would only be able to stay under water for minutes. With the use of a mixture which contained more helium than nitrogen (the air in SCUBA tanks is 80% nitrogen/20%oxygen), divers could stay underwater much longer, without risk of nitrogen narcosis, better known as “the bends”, which can result in death.

The Americans found the Russian military cable 120 miles off the Soviet coast in an area clearly marked as forbidden to civilian vessels – this gave them a good hint as to where to look. They then attached a device twenty feet long to the cable, which wrapped around its entire diameter. All communication that went through this cable (and it was considerable) was recorded on the device to be picked up by another US submarine. So confident were the Soviets in the security of their cable that much of the communications was in the clear (not coded). US intelligence even got to listen to phone conversations between Russian officers, their wives, mistresses and each other about issues that had nothing to do with naval strategy.

2007 map of submarine cables

Much of this technology is still highly classified today. The cable was not pierced, which might let in water and clue in the Russians, and the device was pressure triggered to detach itself should the cable be removed from the ocean floor.

So secret was this project that most of the sailors on board did not know what the true objective of the submarine was. They were told that they were on a top secret mission to retrieve pieces of a subsonic Soviet underwater missile which had blown up. This was actually true. While the divers were deploying their device, the rest of the crew searched for the remains of this missile – which they found. The mission was in actuality…double-secret!

This program continued for almost ten years. The amount of intelligence gleaned from it can only be guessed, though some of the less important information was released at the end of the Cold War in the 1990’s. In 1981, the submarine USS Parche went to retrieve a device from the cable, and found that it was not there – the Soviets were onto the program! It’s a testimony to the skill of the crew of the Parche that they remained undetected, even though the Soviets had to know they were coming.

After a long analysis, it was determined that NSA agent Richard Pelton, who was in massive debt, had been selling the Soviets classified information for some time. Part of this information was “Operation Ivy Bells”. Pelton served twenty-nine years in federal prison, being released in 2015.

*Yujia He*

Rising demand for international communications drive cable capacity growth, yet financing and political risks remain major obstacles.

Chinese investments help finance cable systems in multiple emerging market regions.
Emerging economies need to develop robust domestic regulations and international coordination to reduce political risks, protect cable infrastructure, and manage cyber risks.

### Issue

Digital connectivity is the cornerstone for growth in the 21st Century. A 2009 World Bank report found that for every 10 percent increase in high-speed internet connections, there is a 1.3 percent increase in economic growth. Ninety-nine percent of international telecommunications transit through submarine cables. The lack of resilient digital infrastructure creates a bottleneck to economic development for emerging markets. China is eager to expand its own international communications network and tap into other markets to meet their growing infrastructure needs. This brief analyzes the rising demand for cable infrastructure and obstacles to infrastructure growth, and China’s growing role in the cable industry. It also recommends how emerging economies can enhance international connectivity and address related vulnerabilities.

### Assessment

**Rising demand for international communications infrastructure**

Since the first cable across the English Channel in 1850, submarine cables have served as backbones for international communications. After the 1990s telecom investment boom and the 2000s market downturn, a resurgence came in this decade. The mass adoption of smartphones and cloud computing, and the growing ubiquity of broadband create surging international data demand. According to Submarine Telecoms Forum (STF), since 2014 the industry has added on average over 25 percent capacity (including new systems and upgrades) annually on major cable routes. Major growth occurred in intra-Asia, EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), and Latin America routes. Key factors driving capacity growth in emerging markets include rising capacity demand, government policy, multilateral development banks (MDB) financing, resiliency concerns and technology advancement.

**Obstacles for new infrastructure development**

Financing remains the primary obstacle to cable growth, as submarine cables are capital intensive projects with highly uncertain future returns over the long term of operation. The telecom industry lacks risk reduction schemes seen in other types of infrastructure. Consortia ownership has diffused risks to each participant, with each investing in a small proportion of total capacity to start and sharing the cost of construction and operation. There is, however, a significant upfront cash flow commitment, and coordination can be a challenge as all parties need to agree to any changes. Private ownership using the traditional project finance structure relies on sales to third parties like carriers to repay debt used to finance construction. It has comparably higher risks, due to uncertainties in securing capacity purchasers, fluctuations in future bandwidth pricing, and exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations. Investors may also seek financing from sources such as equipment suppliers, commercial banks, multilateral development banks (MDBs), private equity and venture capital.

Submarine cables are a critical transnational infrastructure that passes through waters with competing uses such as fishing, shipping, offshoring drilling, and military operations, so political risks can affect investment screening and permissions for cable landing and routing. For instance, foreign-invested cables landing in the United States need to be approved by the Federal Communications Commission, the Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS), and regulators from the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Department of Defense collectively known as Team Telecom. As an example, the licensing process for the TransPacific Express Cable (TPE) took 11 months. In emerging markets, inefficient regulatory structures may also lead to lengthy approval processes. For instance, according to Optic Marine Services, permits in Southeast Asia can take between 4 and 18 months. On the other hand, regulatory efficiency has attracted investors to hubs like Hong Kong.

**Growing role of Chinese investments**

China has significant interests in cable infrastructure to meet its connectivity demand and increase connectivity in other emerging markets. According to the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), only ten international submarine cables connect to mainland China, lagging far behind advanced economies like the United States (80 submarine cables) and Japan (23 cables). In 2017 total international bandwidth (including submarine and terrestrial cables) was 7.3Tbps, which on a per capita basis was less than one-twentieth of the United States’. The 13th Five-Year National Information Plan (2015-2020) aims to increase total international bandwidth to 20Tbps by 2020. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), announced in 2013, also pledges to support cable development as part of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. Twelve new cable systems either completed or with contract in force since 2014 have received Chinese investment.

**Protecting Cable Infrastructure and Managing Cyber Risks**

Robust domestic regulations are crucial for cable protection. While states may worry about deliberate attacks, fishing and ship anchoring is responsible for about 70% of cable faults. Without regulatory oversight and public awareness, fishermen and vessels may lack the incentive to take precautions. Cybersecurity is another enduring concern in cable infrastructure. For instance, Edward Snowden’s revelations about the U.S. National Security Agency tapping undersea cables led to the BRICS cable proposal, though the project stalled in 2015. Chinese suppliers can also face suspicions. Huawei Marine is a joint venture established in 2008 between China’s Huawei and UK-based Global Marine Systems. The firm has gained market share by offering new technologies, flexible design for operator needs and cost-efficient installation, and has completed 90 projects across Asia and the Pacific, Europe, the Americas, the Middle East and Africa.

Submarine Cables: Critical Infrastructure for Global Communications
BY DOUG BRAKE | APRIL 2019

Submarine cables play a critical role in global interconnected networks, carrying about 99 percent of international communications traffic. Sharp growth in demand for data, fueled by bandwidth-intensive applications such as video and a proliferation of cloud-based services, has driven a considerable uptick in global submarine cable deployments. The last five years have seen an average 26 percent increase in available capacity per year on major routes. This policy briefing presents a snapshot of key facts about submarine cables. After a brief introduction, it addresses the growth in demand for submarine cables, common financing methods, major suppliers, and closes with other important dynamics in the submarine cable industry.

THE BASICS OF SUBMARINE CABLES
The history of submarine communications cables goes back to 1850, when the first cable was laid across the English Channel to allow telegraph communications between the United Kingdom and continental Europe. Today, submarine cables use fiber-optic technology, whereby information is encoded onto waves of light transmitted by lasers across thin glass fibers. The throughput varies with optical technology used, but today’s most advanced fiber links are capable of transmitting over 200 terabits per second. The capacity actually used—the “lit capacity”—is generally much lower, allowing cable owners to scale up the use to meet customer demand over time, or to accommodate large shifts in Internet traffic if another cable is cut or damaged.

There were approximately 378 submarine cables in service as of early 2019, traversing roughly 1.2 million kilometers, connecting virtually all countries with a coastline. The cables run along the ocean floor joining nations that have large volumes of traffic to exchange. Near to shore, the cables are shielded and buried to protect against potential run-ins with anchors, wildlife, fishing trawlers, etcetera. However, in deeper parts of the ocean, where damage is less likely, cables run along the surface of the ocean floor and are as thin as a garden hose. Even with shielding and burying, each year sees more than 100 cable faults on average, usually due to fishing trawlers or anchors, but occasionally from natural disasters such as earthquakes.

One area where there are more disruptions than average is the Strait of Malacca. This busy shipping corridor contains more than a dozen cables connecting a large majority of the traffic between Asia, India, the Middle East, and Europe. Submarine cables are predominantly owned by consortiums of telecommunications carriers that join together to pay for these expensive projects. In recent years, major web companies, such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon have increasingly invested in their own cables, outpacing the traditional Internet backbone providers.

DEMAND AND GROWTH
Cable construction has picked up in recent years, after a period of very slow growth. More cable was deployed in 2017 (over 100,000 kilometers) than in all of 2014–2016 combined. Some of the largest growth in recent years has been in the Americas, with the total capacity along major routes nearly doubling since 2014.

Demand growth is built into cable deployments. Most submarine cables are designed with a significant buffer between total capacity and actual lit capacity. On average, only 15 to 30 percent of submarine cable capacity is lit, allowing for large spikes in demand to be accommodated, if, for example, another cable would be damaged and global traffic rerouted.

FINANCING
Deploying and maintaining submarine cables is an expensive undertaking. Since 1990, nearly $48 billion has been invested in submarine cables, with almost half of that focused on the Americas. Submarine cables are a complicated business, with risks not well understood by the average lending institution. The expense and obscurity of submarine cable has required unique financing models compared to other infrastructure projects.

MAJOR SUPPLIERS
The three largest companies offering to build submarine cables are Alcatel Submarine Networks of Alcatel-Lucent, based in France; TE SubCom of TE Connectivity, out of Switzerland; and NEC Corporation of Japan. Given the central role submarine cables play in connecting global networks, several policy topics are worthy of attention. There are also concerns as to whether submarine cables have adequate protections under existing international law, such as the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.

Since 1990, nearly $48 billion has been invested in submarine cables. The vast majority of the investment comes from consortiums of telecommunications firms pooling their resources.","The article titled ""Submarine Cables: Critical Infrastructure for Global Communications"" by Doug Brake discusses submarine cables extensively, highlighting their critical role in global communications.

It mentions that submarine cables experience more than 100 faults annually, primarily due to fishing trawlers, anchors, and natural disasters.

The article also explains that when a cable is damaged, global traffic can be rerouted, demonstrating the implications of cut cables on internet connectivity.

These discussions indicate that the topic of cut sea cables is treated as a central theme rather than a minor mention.

Therefore, the article satisfies the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables."
"Russian Spy Submarines Tampering with Undersea Cables: A Security Concern?","Explores the significance of undersea cables, detailing historical tampering incidents and potential threats to internet stability from Russian military activities.","https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/russian-spy-submarines-are-tampering-undersea-cables-make-internet-work-should-we-be","2018-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","Sebastien Roblin",Yes,"Sebastien Roblin","Washington, D.C., United States",-,"2018-08-19","English","The National Interest","In 2018 reports have multiplied in the United States and Europe that Russian has intensified its submarine activity around the undersea cables which are essential for the global operation of the internet.

Yes, you heard that right—the ability of an American user to access a website in Europe or vice versa largely depends upon a network of several hundred distinct armored, fiber-optic Submarine Communication Cables that run across around six hundred thousand miles of ocean floor—and Moscow is dispatching mini submarines apparently to tamper with them.

Washington is reportedly plenty worried about this fact, but can’t exactly get on its high horse about this activity, as U.S. submarines actually pioneered the art of tapping into submarine cables decades earlier. In fact, the USS Jimmy Carter, one of only three super-advanced Sea Wolf class submarines built, has been specially modified to perform such missions.

The first undersea cables established telegraph communications between the UK and France in 1850, followed by a trans-Atlantic cable in 1858. The history of cable-tampering dates all the way back to the Spanish American war 120 years ago when the United States cut cables connecting Madrid with Spanish outposts in the Philippines, Puerto Rico and Cuba—the operation in Guantanamo Bay undertaken while battling nearby Spanish ground and naval forces!

Trans-oceanic cables were also cut by belligerents on all sides during World War I (when submarines first entered the global cable sabotage role) and II. Even in peacetime, undersea cables lack much in the way of formal protection under international law as they do not formally belong to any one nation.

It’s not exactly clear what the Russian submarines, under the direction of the Russian Navy’s Directorate of Deep Sea Research (GUGI) are doing with the cables—or what they’re capable of doing. Tapping into the cables requires exotic techniques to access the delicate fibers inside the cable without exposing them to seawater. The Jimmy Carter reportedly uses a special floodable chamber to perform this operation. No Russian ships are confirmed to have such a capability, but Russian media sources have claimed a capability to hack into the cables.

Sabotage would be simpler to perform, but difficult to scale up for meaningful effect. This is because networks are designed with a high degree of redundancy as cables are routinely damaged by falling anchors, sharks (yes, really!), fishing lines, earthquakes, human mischief makers and so forth. Cable breaks average fifty per year in the Atlantic alone. If a few of the cables go down, data requests are simply shunted to other cables while a fleet of specially appointed, repair boats cruise over and repair the breakages.

It would therefore take a coordinated, massed attack to truly cripple the trans-Atlantic cables—a feat that experts claim is logistically impractical. Even in that event, satellite communications (though more vulnerable to interception) could be used for vital tasks, though a genuine massive cable shutdown would indeed cripple trans-Atlantic web access, with major spillover effects on the economy and financial sector.

If you glance at the global cable network at this site, though, you can see just how extensive the redundancies are between Europe and the United States—but may also note that some countries are not so well connected.

Such geographically isolated countries, and specific military or even industrial sites (think oil platforms) may be more vulnerable to sabotage. For example, Vietnam had internet access crippled for months in 2007 when fishermen pulled up one of the country’s two undersea cables with their fishing line. A targeted cable attack could be used for operational effect in a specific region as well.

In fact, it’s possible that Russia’s true target are the Pentagon’s secret DoDIN cable network distinct from the publicly accessible civilian system. These would have less redundancy than civilian cables and could disable key communication capabilities during a crisis. Already, an accidental cable outage in 2008 crippled U.S. drone operations over Iraq for several days.

NATO also maintains an undersea network called the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) for monitoring the movements of submarines—the sabotaging of which would facilitate Russian submarine operations. (China incidentally has begun building its own ‘Underwater Great Wall’, starting with listening posts near Micronesia and the southern tip of the Marianna Trench.) After decades of neglect, the Pentagon has begun upgrading the system.

At any rate, Russia has deployed increasing number of special-operations oriented mini-submarines to facilitate it clandestine cable activities. Some operate from a secret base in the Arctic Kola Peninsula, and others are based upon an ‘oceanographic research vessel’ called the Yantar. (Again, this kind of obvious fiction was also used by the U.S. Navy during the Cold War with ships like the USS Pueblo.)

The Yantar carries two three person mini-submarines Rus and Consul, which can dive down to six thousand meters—allowing them to reach very deep cables—and may store additional submarines or unmanned submersibles in its huge hangar. Submarine expert HI Sutton at Covert Shores has helpfully mapped out how the Yantar’s activities clearly follow undersea cables near Cuba, Turkey, and the U.S. nuclear ballistic missile submarine base at King’s Baby, Georgia (likely scouting for secret U.S. military cables). A second Yantar-class vessel is scheduled to enter service in 2020.

Another one of Russia’s one-of-a-kind Special Operations subs is the sixty or seventy-four-meter long Losharik (named after a cartoon horse) which is powered by a nuclear reactor and can reportedly dive as deep as twenty-five hundred meters under the sea. Most military submarines can only safely dive between two hundred to five hundred meters. Appearing more conventional from the outside, Losharik’s interior is built out of seven six-meter diameter spherical compartments to better withstand pressure. The short-range Losharik is hauled into position by the much larger Podmovskovye mothership submarine converted from the Delta-class nuclear-powered attack submarine K-64. The converted Delta-class Orenburg is also capable of deploying mini-submarines, and an additional Oscar-class submarine is being converted to this purpose.

The U.S. has begun responding to the threat, with 2018 defense budget authorizing construction of a second cable-laying/repair ship costing $250 million to supplement the only one currently in U.S. military service, the USS Zeus. Sanctions imposed on Russia in June 2018 have targeted a Russian mini-submarine builder associated with cable-tampering operations. A newly formed joint-U.S./Europe Atlantic Command will also strengthen NATO’s ability to monitor submarine activities. A logical additional step would be to strengthen international law around cables to make the act of cutting them more transgressive in a non-wartime context.

Generally speaking, fear of a massive cable attack is probably over-hyped at least for a country with as may redundant cables as the United States pitted against a limited number of Russian special operations submarines. Furthermore, spying and attacks on cables have abundant historical precedents.

Nonetheless, the extensive Russian military activity around the submarine cables surely reveals that they are perceived as a valuable avenue for asymmetric attack and intelligence gathering, and a capacity to launch a more targeted attack against selected cables could cause significant disruptions.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, including their importance, historical incidents of tampering, and potential implications of Russian military actions.

January/February 2017  
By Frank Rose  

We increasingly rely on space, cyberspace, and fiber-optic communications cables in all aspects of our lives. These systems are critical for social and economic activity, but most importantly to defend our security. At the same time, these conduits for communication are vulnerable to state and nonstate actors. The continued and assured access to these capabilities is vital to global strategic stability.

In 2015, approximately 97 percent of the world’s transoceanic communications transited over privately held, commercial, undersea fiber-optic communications cables. A large-scale outage of these undersea cables would affect critical governmental and business operations, communications, financial transactions, logistics, and transportation. We are concerned that potential adversaries may be looking for vulnerabilities in undersea cables around the world.

Cyberthreats to U.S. national and economic security are increasing in frequency, scale, sophistication, and severity of impact. The ranges of cyberthreat actors, methods of attack, targeted systems, and victims are also expanding. Adding to the problem, it is not always easy to identify the origin of such attacks.

Further, our reliance on international space systems has risen to an unprecedented global scale. We already face a global threat from electronic warfare systems capable of jamming satellite communications systems and global navigation space systems. In addition, threats to space systems from debris or irresponsible activities are increasing. In particular, we are concerned by Chinese and Russian pursuit of weapons systems to destroy satellites in orbit. The debris created from such activities lingers uncontrollably, thus creating the potential for impacts far beyond the destruction of an individual targeted satellite.

We should not look at space, cyber, and undersea cables independently of one another. If a determined adversary wants to cut off U.S. and allied access to communications infrastructure, it is likely to deploy capabilities to attack space, cyberspace, and undersea cables at the same time, in a coordinated manner, and across a broad spectrum of means.

There are also cross-domain vulnerabilities. What happens in outer space won’t stay in outer space. Satellites are vulnerable to cyberintrusions, as we saw take place in 2014 when a cyberattack compromised four U.S. weather satellites. Banking, mapping, and other essential parts of the global internet infrastructure are dependent on space assets for services such as timing and location data. Additionally, space and cyberassets are vital to our deterrent and defensive capabilities, including communications, positioning, and nuclear command and control. It is easy to see how attacks in these domains could lead to a wider kinetic conflict.

It is interesting to see where there are linkages in the policy and diplomatic approach to addressing these threats, especially in space and cyber domains. A common thread is the lack of widely accepted and enforceable norms of responsible behavior. There are existing treaties on space policy and undersea cables, whereas none currently exist relating to cyberspace. In space and cyberspace, we face similar challenges to pursuing traditional arms control, given the dual-use nature of these systems, the number of actors, and the challenges of attribution and verification. To address these challenges, we have worked to pursue consensus among states that international law applies in both domains and further clarify how foundational laws, such as the law of armed conflict and the UN Charter, apply.

So what does any of this have to do with nuclear arms control and disarmament? Continued progress in reducing nuclear arsenals cannot be divorced from the global security environment or our unconditional commitment to the security of our allies. Ensuring security depends in part on our success in constructing mutually agreed-on norms that referee behavior in these largely unregulated domains. Establishing clear rules of the road in these realms can help create the security conditions for future nuclear arms reductions.

Going forward, we must enhance and communicate our cross-domain deterrence in a credible manner to achieve and maintain stability. This effort will require better monitoring and verification capabilities to make attribution easier. We also need to be working more closely with our allies. Our worldwide system of alliances is a true “asymmetric advantage” of the United States. Meanwhile, we must look within our own government to ensure we are taking a whole-of-government approach and to avoid the instinct of stove-piping that can paralyze the bureaucracy. I see this area as a priority for the U.S. government now and in the future.

**Title:** New Threats, Old Technology: Vulnerabilities in Undersea Cables

**Abstract**  
Undersea cables are among the most critical technologies supporting today's global data and voice communications. Long-standing physical vulnerabilities to attack persist: cable landing stations, for example, cluster high-value cable systems at single geographic points, but without the physical protections provided to other critical infrastructure such as telecommunication data centers. With an increasing number of cable operators using remotely-controlled network management systems, operators have introduced additional risk of large-scale cyber attacks, adding new urgency to securing all potential points of compromise, both the physical sites and well as the logical infrastructure. While individually governments and industries have taken some steps to address such matters, much work remains. Collaboration on fortifying security with new regulatory and voluntary action, working through existing bodies such as Team Telecom under the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, and the International Cable Protection Committee, should accelerate.

**INTRODUCTION**  
Many cyber experts predict 2012 will usher in a new era of malware attacks on critical infrastructure systems. The predictions follow reports that the Stuxnet worm may have at least ""four cousins,"" several of which have yet to be fully identified. Security firms now rank cyber attacks on industrial supervisory control and data acquisition (""SCADA"") systems, which control everything from power to water, as among top threats. Surveying the field, McAfee concluded there was ""little good news about cybersecurity [and] the crucial services that depend on information technology and industrial control systems."" Control systems, McAfee said, especially those connected to the Internet, introduce ""significant vulnerabilities into systems never designed to sustain such risks."" Those vulnerabilities now proliferate. Conferees at January 2012's International Conference on Cyber Security heard reports of the discovery in 2011 of 147 so-called ""zero-day vulnerabilities"" -unpatched flaws -in Siemens-based SCADA systems. In December 2011, the U.S. Department of Homeland security issued an alert: it had discovered ""researchers"" using a new search engine called ""SHODAN"". SHODAN's purpose: search and find Internet-facing control systems. The risk is real. In Texas, a hacker posted screen shots to the Internet of a SCADA system monitoring a water treatment plant in South Houston. New Threats, Old Technology Vulnerabilities in Undersea Communications Cable Network Management Systems apparently both Wall Street and transportation systems. Hackers compromised SCADA systems in three cities, the FBI reported, and could have ""theoretically dumped sewage into a lake, or shut off the power to a shopping mall."" With all the commotion, there exists now an abundance of regulation, advice -and confusion about what to do next. For all of the government's efforts, for example, the U.S. Government Accountability Office reported in 2012 that ""DHS and the other sector-specific agencies have not identified the key cybersecurity guidance applicable to or widely used in each of their respective critical infrastructure sectors."" This paper explores the vulnerabilities to cyber attacks of infrastructure that today carries nearly all the world's data and voice traffic: undersea communications cables. Long-standing physical vulnerabilities in cable infrastructure have been compounded by new risk found in the network management systems that monitor and control cable operations. Unlike an attack on a water treatment plant's control systems, however, an attack on the cables' control systems could devastate the world's economies -presenting a different kind of Internet ""kill switch"" altogether -shutting down world commerce, and doing it all with the click of a mouse.

**BRIEF BACKGROUND ON UNDERSEA COMMUNICATION CABLE SYSTEMS**  
Ever since the dot com bubble burst last decade, undersea communication cable operators have faced difficulties in generating a profitable business model. In the late 1990's and early 2000's, financial speculators invested heavily in building and deploying cables to accommodate the predicted Internet boom. When the bubble burst, global demand for bandwidth fell, creating significant bandwidth glut, primarily on U.S. trans-oceanic routes. As other industries have, undersea cable operators turned to technology to drive costs down and maintain profitability. Today, the undersea cable industry is finding better ways to connect itself over its own infrastructure. Network management systems, for example, help operators reduce personnel and management costs. Using remote, web-based technologies they connect cable systems, landing stations, spare depots, and other cable system components -all decreasing the need for humans in the equation. Connecting cable sites with software creates more efficiency and provides operators greater operational awareness. However, it creates potential new risk, particularly to cyber attacks.

**CRITICALITY OF UNDERSEA CABLES**  
As a technology system with physical, logical, and human components, cables have long been a high-risk, single point of potential failure. For highly connected nations, both developing and developed, the consequence of failure is higher today than ever, as global Internet traffic has surged, and much of the world's commerce and security now relies on cable for nearly all its voice and data needs. Undersea communication cables are, in fact, the only technology that can transmit large amounts of bandwidths across bodies of water at low latencies (delays) and low costs. In fact, undersea cable systems worldwide transmit nearly 99 percent of all trans-oceanic Internet and data traffic. In the U.S., over 90 percent of international voice and data traffic is transmitted via fiber. Little can substitute for cable. In the event of a catastrophic failure to the entire cable architecture, for example, satellites and other technologies would likely be able to recoup only a sliver of that capacity. With the world so dependent on cable systems, the technology needs to be among the most reliable in the world. Industry makes it so: cables are operational with up to ""5 nines"" reliability, or 99.999 percent of the time. Only highly critical systems such as space shuttle technology and nuclear weapons security have similar reliability. High reliability comes at high cost. Since undersea cable deployment is expensive, forces of history and economies of scale have, over time, concentrated cable landing sites in a few geographic areas. From GIS data, at least ten major cable chokepoints exist around the world today. For example, much of the U.S. trans-Atlantic bandwidth comes ashore in just a few locations within a 30-mile radius of New York City. Some in the industry claim that nearly all that same trans-Atlantic traffic then funnels into one pipe under a single building in downtown Manhattan, contravening the popular belief of extraordinary redundancy and resiliency within today's telecommunications infrastructure.

**CABLES AND THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY**  
With respect to global financial flows, in particular, undersea communication cables are exceptionally important. At a recent cable seminar, a U.S. Federal Reserve representative stated that cables carry an excess of $10 trillion a day in transactions. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) network uses undersea fiber-optic communications cables to transmit financial data to more than 8,300 member financial institutions in 195 countries. The CLS Bank operates the largest multi-currency cash settlement system in the world, trading over 1 million transactions and over $4.7 trillion dollars a day over undersea cables. In 2011, SWIFT's network handled nearly 15 million messages daily. The U.S. Clearing House Interbank Payment System processes over $1 trillion a day to more than 22 countries. With trillions traded daily, a multi-cable outage, especially in a regional financial hub, has enormous ramifications for the global financial order. History proves this. One need only recall the days following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when one day later Wall Street was ready to trade, the Fed was eager to get capital flowing back into the markets -but the telecommunications infrastructure had succumbed to catastrophic failure. The global markets stood by, waiting.

**CABLE LANDING SITES: EXPOSURES AND RISKS**  
While the financial services industry eventually moved to address this, there remain today numerous single points of physical risk: the places where cables make landfall, often clustered regionally. The U.S. State Department listed the world's cable landing sites as among the most critical of infrastructures for the United States. With good reason: by gaining access to terminals located within cable landing sites, or to control systems managing the fiber-optic wavelengths themselves, a hacker could acquire control over portions of international data and voice traffic and, potentially, the power to disrupt or degrade significant portions of states' cyber infrastructure.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, highlighting their critical role in global communications and the vulnerabilities associated with them.

Ever heard about Russia’s Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research? Well, better now than later. The Directorate, nicknamed GUGI, is a branch directly under General Staff of the Armed Forces. From its base 100 kilometers east of the border to Norway, a fleet of nine nuclear-powered submarines and a few surface vessels frequently sails out on special missions. Little is known about the nature of those voyages, except reports of significantly increased activity along subsea cables which carry global electronic communication.

In this article, the Barents Observer takes a closer look at the base in Olenya Bay and activities carried on. Through satellite images and other non-classified sources.

Russia is currently expanding its fleet of special purpose vessels aimed at seabed operations. Surprisingly little information is published about the vessels and their homeport north of Murmansk. A recent report, though, written by Member of the British Parliament Rishi Sunak, quotes several NATO officials openly claiming the vessels are «aggressively operating» near cables vital for global data communication.

> _«We are now seeing Russian underwater activity in the vicinity of underwater cables that I don’t believe we have ever seen.»_

Before Christmas, the Washington Post quoted U.S. Navy Admiral Andrew Lennon, commander of NATO’s submarine force: «We are now seeing Russian underwater activity in the vicinity of underwater cables that I don’t believe we have ever seen.» The Admiral pointed to transatlantic connections, linking internet between Europe and North-America. «Russia is clearly taking an interest in NATO and NATO nations’ undersea infrastructure.»

Lennon declined to say whether NATO believes Russian axillary submarines have actually touched the cables. Russia’s Embassy in Oslo has not responded to questions from the Barents Observer about the accusations.

One of the intelligence vessels in question is «_Yantar_» - which can be seen moored at the pier in the upper right corner of the satellite image in top of this article. She carries two small submarines thought to be capable of cutting cables or tapping them for information, the British report says. Officially, the ship is used for deep-sea research and rescue operations.

Since 2015, the vessel has been sailing from the Kola Peninsula on voyages outside the coast of Norway, across the Atlantic, sailing the east coast of North-America from Canada in the north to Cuba in the south. Currently, «_Yantar_» is outside the coast of South America assisting in the search for the Argentinian navy’s submarine that went missing in November. A sister vessel, «_Almaz_», also to act as a mothership to mini-submarines, is currently under construction at a yard in Kaliningrad.

Comprising more than 800,000 kilometers of fibre-optics, the world’s 213 independent subsea cables are the arteries to modern society as we know it. Rishi Sunak explains the reason to be worried in his report: «In a single day, these cables carry some $10 trillion of financial transfers and process some 15 million financial transactions.» 97% of global communication are transmitted via cables lying deep beneath the oceans. There are no way satellites can compensate in case cables are cut.

> «Undersea cables are the indispensable infrastructure of our time, essential to our modern life and digital economy, yet they are inadequately protected and highly vulnerable to attack at sea and on land, from both hostile states and terrorists.»

A critical scenario is cables cut or disrupted with immediately catastrophically affect both to economy and society. Sunak points to Crimea, where internet and telecommunication was unexpectedly cut off from the rest of Ukraine in March 2014.

Parliament Member Rishi Sunak especially mentions Scandinavia when elaborating on Russia’s aggressive operations near undersea cables. Several links are from the Baltic to Sweden and Finland, while Denmark is linked with Sweden, the U.K., Iceland, Germany and Norway. Norway have two Arctic cables to Svalbard, plus several interregional tele- and optical fiber links along the coast, like in Finnmark, the region bordering Russia in the north.

Asked by the Barents Observer about possible Russian activities near tele- or data communication cables, Norway’s Minister of Defense, Frank Bakke-Jensen says both Norway and allies keep a close eye on what happens.

In general terms the Minister says: «Russia’s military capability has been significantly strengthened in recent years, also in our neighborhood. They develop new capacities and have more training and exercises. However, the High North still remain a region largely characterized by stability and cooperation. Increased military activity shows that we and our allies should closely follow Russian activity and the development in our neighboring areas,» Bakke-Jensen says. He will not elaborate further.

Meanwhile, the officers living in Olenya Bay prepare for new submarines to be attached to the secret missions carried out.

Consisting of nine nuclear powered submarines today, the 29th Special Submarine Squadron have means and technology to dive deeper than any of the other weapon carrying war-submarines sailing for the Northern Fleet. The satellite image in the top shows how entrance to the base town, storehouses and piers is strictly regulated. All surrounded by barbed wire fences. Two road checkpoints will effectively hinder unwanted persons access to the harbour area where the submarines are moored. The first one is on the main road from Murmansk, before the exit to Polyarny, while the second one is seen at the base in Olenya Bay. To load and unload equipment used on seafloor missions, and to avoid being spotted from satellites, two floating docks serve the submarines at the base.

A Russian mapping service based on satellite images, Wikimapia, details the town in Olenya Bay with barracks, 5-floors apartment houses, a naval hospital, school, food shop, canteen and café and the boiler house for the central heating. In the port, the different vessels, a floating power station, the two docks, garages, technical workshops and piers are marked.

Russia’s Yandex map satellite service even reveals two of the actual special purpose submarines at pier. One of them is the 74 meters long Losharik, the other is likely an older 53 meters long Paltus class (X-ray by NATO). Both are nuclear powered. More rare photos of the Uniform-class mini-submarines, and how they are believed to operate on the seafloor, are posted at the blog-site Military Russia. The photos are both from the base in Olenya Bay and from the naval yard in Severodvinsk outside Arkhangelsk.

With the ships in Olenya Bay, Russia has the world’s largest deep-sea fleet. Among the capabilities are two titanium hull Kashalot (Uniform-class) submarines named AS-13 and AS-15. A third vessel of the class, AS-33, is reportedly written off. There are three of the Paltus (X-ray class by NATO), the AS-23, AS-21 and AS-35. Then, it’s the Losharik, AS-12, the latest spy-submarine added to the fleet in the late 90s.

> At the yard in Severodvinsk, yet another nuclear powered mini-submarine is currently under construction.

Additionally, two larger former ballistic missile submarines are rebuilt for the 29th Special Submarine Squadron. «_Orenburg_» (BS-136) is a former Delta-III class, while the «_Podmoskovye_» (BS-64) is a rebuilt Delta-IV class submarine. In late 2016, the Barents Observer posted a video of the «_Podmoskovye_» sailing out to the White Sea from the yard in Severodvinsk after 16 years of refit. Among other things, the missile compartment was cut out and space for scientific-experimental equipment were placed instead. Most visible from outside is the flat deck behind the tower where mini-submarines can be attached. It is also believed that «_Podmoskovye_» can carry the Losharik mini-submarine below the hull.

The submarine can also bring - or remove - other small installations and devices for military purposes to be placed on the sea floor. In the Arctic, or at other locations important for the Russian navy. Such devices can be noice-makers to distract foreign submarines when Russian submarines sail out from the Kola Peninsula to the North Atlantic. Other listening devices can detect sounds made by the propellers of enemy ships. The submarine can launch and recover unmanned subsea vehicles.

Lifting sensitive equipment from crashed aircrafts, other vessels or even satellites from the seabed are other tasks to be carried out by the submarine.

The head of Britain's military says Russia could try to sever undersea communications cables, and protecting them is a defense priority for NATO.

Air Chief Marshal Stuart Peach says cutting or disrupting the cables could have a ""potentially catastrophic"" economic effect.

Peach told an audience at the Royal United Services Institute that ""along with our Atlantic allies, we have prioritised missions and tasks to protect the sea lines of communication.""

In yesterday's speech, Peach said that Russia ""in addition to new ships and submarines continues to perfect both unconventional capabilities and information warfare."" He said NATO is working ""to match and understand Russian fleet modernization.""

When a July 2015 undersea tremor triggered a rockslide between the islands of Saipan and Tinian in the Northern Marianas Islands, it cut the only fiber-optic cable connecting the archipelago to the global network. Air traffic control grounded flights, automated teller machines shut down, web and phone connections broke.

All the feared impacts of a cyber attack became real for the islanders. A Taiwan-based cable repair ship eventually restored the link, but that was a single break from one natural occurrence. How much more disruption could a deep-sea-faring nation cause its rivals through malicious intent?

Though often mentioned in passing, the fact that the overwhelming bulk of Internet activity travels along submarine cables fails to register with the public. High-flying satellites orbiting the crowded skies, continent-spanning microwave towers and million miles of old 20th Century copper phone wire all carry but a fraction of the Earth's Internet traffic compared with deep-sea fiber-optic cables.

All that buzz occurs in the dark cold parts of inner space and a few very quiet places on land. If you want to tap into that buzz, those quiet places where the sea cables make landfall—from the onshore facilities out to deep-water offshore—are your prized targets. The U.S. has developed exquisite abilities to access underwater things.

_(This first appeared in 2015.)_

One of America's greatest techno-spy capers of the Cold War involved tapping Soviet Navy communications via a submarine cable in the 1970s and 1980s. Before IVY BELLS ended with its unmasking by Soviet spy Ronald Pelton, its clandestine aquanauts, spy sub and nuclear-powered ""bug"" made espionage history.

If, however, you wish to practice hybrid warfare—disruption and degradation with little overt engagement—then the ability to cut submarine cables at will and at depth gives you a very powerful weapon. Cut up undersea hydrophone networks and you deafen your adversary. Cut Internet cables and you have the ultimate denial-of-service cyber weapon.

In the 1960s, America's advancing deep-sea capabilities alarmed the Soviets for good reason. If the Americans could locate sunken subs and retrieve satellites from the supposedly inviolable deeps, their underwater black ops directly threatened Soviet security.

Amidst a wave of 1960s deep-sea activity—including its saturation-diving SEALAB program, its search & recovery missions for _USS Thresher_, _USS Scorpion_, a lost H-bomb and a new submarine-rescue approach—Admiral Hyman Rickover got his dream sub built. Launched in 1968, the _NR-1_ was a marvel of American ingenuity—a nuclear-powered four-man minisub able to dive over 3,000ft and stay there for weeks.

During the later Cold War, the USSR developed its own very sophisticated underwater black ops capabilities. Targets included the US Navy's SOSUS underwater hydrophone system which ran along the Atlantic from Greenland to the United Kingdom at depths of up to 12,000ft. With its primacy in titanium metallurgy and skill in nuclear technology, the Soviet Union built several competitors to the _NR-1_.

The Russian Federation inherited these assets along with the Ministry of Defense branch (GUGI, or Main Directorate Deep Sea Research) that supervised those programs. The Russian deep-sea clandestine systems survived the collapse of the USSR and received funding even during the lean years during the 1990s. Even as the United States lost the _NR-1's_ capabilities to retirement, Russia bolstered its deep-sea black activities.

Between August and October 2012, a Russian Arctic expedition mapped the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean to locate resources and establish maritime boundaries. A deep-sea ""research"" submarine placed a small Russian flag on the ocean floor some 13,200ft below the North Pole to mark Russia's claims.

The ""research sub"" was in fact one of Russia's secret deep-sea assets, the nuclear-powered minisub _Losharik_. A naval blogger pointed out that clues to _Losharik's_ internal configuration lay in the vessel's name. ""Losharik"" is a cartoon horse made of linked spheres—some analysts suspect that the sub's interior consists of linked spherical titanium pressure hulls.

_Losharik_ rides to its dive sites in the belly of a larger converted nuclear missile sub, the _Orenburg_. Both have been busy—_Orenburg_ recently surprised Norwegian scientists by popping up from beneath the sea ice after doing who-knows-what.

""[I]t was inexpedient to use GUGI equipment for scientific exploration and mineral extraction,"" said a Russian source. ""On the other hand, they are the world experts in manned deep-water investigations and the training of their crews is on the same level as that of cosmonauts. If we don’t find a job for them, Russia is likely to lose this highly skilled workforce.""

With _Losharik_, its sister sub _Nelma_ and the two bathyscaphes _Rus_ and _Consul,_ the GUGI commands the largest manned deep-sea fleet in the world. Whether domestically produced or foreign imports, these assets can be quietly moved around within Russia itself. Combined with its growing submarine-rescue fleet and Naval Spetznaz outfits, Russia now fields a very powerful undersea hybrid warfare capability. Let's hope the US Navy is on the case.

While the idea that steel and plastic pipes are integral to our life seems anachronistic in this age of cloud computing, “nothing could be further from the truth”, states the report by British think tank Policy Exchange.

Physical pipes, lying deep beneath the ocean, are the “jugulars of the world economy”, writes Rishi Sunak, Conservative MP and the author of the report. 97% of global communications and $10 trillion in daily financial transactions are transmitted not by satellites in the sky, but by undersea cables.

But despite this dependency, security remains a challenge, the report warns.

Undersea cables are “inadequately protected and highly vulnerable to attack at sea and on land, from both hostile states and terrorists”, the think tank says. Their exact locations are isolated and publicly available, making them “a singularly attractive target for our enemies”.

In particular, the report warns that Russia, Iran and China could all look to pipes on the ocean floor as potential “asymmetric targets”.

US intelligence officials have already flagged Russian submarines “aggressively operating” near Atlantic cables as part of its broader interest in unconventional methods of warfare, the think tank says. When Russia annexed Crimea, one of its first moves was to sever the main cable connection to the outside world.

In his foreword to the report, Admiral James Stavridis, US Navy and former NATO supreme allied commander, says that over the course of his career, he has seen the Atlantic Ocean “transition from being a theatre characterised by near complete NATO supremacy to a space that Russia is actively contesting through a resurgent naval doctrine”.

He adds: “If the relative weakness of the Russian position makes a conventional conflict with NATO unlikely, it also raises the appeal for them of asymmetric targets like fibre optic cables.

“Britain and our NATO allies must ensure that our maritime capabilities get the investment they need.”

The report, which has been endorsed by several senior officials including Admiral Stavridis, Robert Hannigan, former security adviser to the prime minister and director of GCHQ until earlier this year, and General Lord Houghton, former UK chief of defence staff, makes several recommendations to improve the security of the pipes under the sea.

It urges the next strategic defence and security review to specifically address threats to Britain’s security from attacks on its undersea cable infrastructure. There should also be a review of UK landing sites where cables come ashore, in order to improve security. The government should also work with private communications companies to install more backup ‘dark cables’ and improve monitoring at sea.

Citing the example of Australia and New Zealand, the report suggests establishing “Cable Protection Zones” around the highest value communications corridors.

It also calls on Britain to lead efforts to develop a new international treaty to protect undersea cables.","The article titled ""Undersea cables ‘vulnerable to attack’ from Russia, Iran and China"" discusses the vulnerabilities of undersea cables, stating they are ""indispensable"" to the global economy and highly susceptible to attacks from various nations.

It highlights that 97% of global communications are transmitted via these cables and emphasizes their critical role in economic transactions.

The article also mentions specific incidents and threats, including the historical context of attacks on these cables, making it clear that the topic of cut sea cables is central to the discussion, rather than a minor mention.

Given this focus and the detailed examination of the implications of attacks on undersea cables, the article satisfies the criterion."

The report, titled [_Undersea Cables: Indispensable, insecure_](https://policyexchange.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Undersea-Cables.pdf) written by Conservative MP Rishi Sunak, discusses how easily cable-based communications can be disrupted, and the past and potential future threats to their continued function.

Cables carrying data are essential to modern communications but lack both physical and legal protections, according to Sunak. Their locations are freely available to the public in order to prevent accidental damage by shipping, but the laws governing them are lax.

He described the current laws as ""far more suited to the comparatively peripheral role the infrastructure played in the '70s and '80s, than to the indispensable status they now hold in the internet age"".

The age of those laws means that enforcement agencies struggle to deal with suspects and offenders with appropriate severity, said Sunak, who added that the need for reform has been ignored by national governments because the cables are often managed by private companies rather than nation states, and therefore slip under the gaze of legislators.

The risk of severed cables is compounded by the aggregation of cables into ""dangerously concentrated"" choke points. Examples of this are the Luzon Strait between Taiwan and the Philippines, which connects several eastern countries and the US, or a single building in Alexandria, Egypt, which holds the meeting point of five transnational cables (find it yourself at 31° 11.738' N, 29° 54.108' E).

This kind of infrastructure damage could appeal to terrorists, Sunak writes, indicating a [foiled Al-Qaeda attack in 2007,](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/al-qaeda-plot-to-bring-down-uk-internet-b8vb32twcwt) meant to target an internet exchange in London, as proof of this.

As well as terrorists, he points at Russia as the other major threat. He cites the severing of the main cable leading into the Crimean peninsula when Russia annexed the region in 2014. The operation of its submarines along cable routes, and the use of the Yantar-class ""intelligence ship"", which carries two submarines believed to be capable of destroying cables or tapping them for information, is also referenced, and are given as evidence by Sunak that Russia may be considering disrupting infrastructure as part of its military strategy.

Sunak recommended that government departments should focus on cable protection in future reviews, and that undersea cables should be designated as critical national infrastructure. Others involved updating international law and military codes to ensure legal protection, and the construction of new cables in diverse locations to act as backups.

Another recommendation pointed to Australia and New Zealand's [Cable Protection Zones](https://www.acma.gov.au/Industry/Telco/Infrastructure/Submarine-cabling-and-protection-zones/submarine-telecommunications-cables-submarine-cable-zones-i-acma#referenced-items), where ships cannot fish or anchor, and can only sail through under supervision by the Coast Guard. Britain should ""encourage the establishment"" of such zones in the Suez and the Mediterranean to protect connections with the Middle East, Sunak wrote.

In his concluding remarks in the report, Sunak said: ""Disrupting cables is not only possible and surprisingly easy, but it can have significantly negative consequences for our security and prosperity.

""Despite this backdrop, there has historically been minimal state involvement in the sector, despite its strategic importance."" ®","The article discusses the vulnerabilities and threats to undersea cables, directly mentioning terms like 'undersea cables' and the risks of 'severed cables'.

Peach's warning came after British think tank Policy Exchange released a report that urged the United Kingdom and NATO to beef up security of undersea cables.

Not that America hasn't tampered with underwater communications links. One of the most successful U.S. intelligence operations ever was using submarines to covertly tap Soviet cables in the 1970s. In 1971, Operation Ivy Bells sent the USS Halibut to the Sea of Okhotsk, where it wrapped a listening device around a Soviet line. Until the operation was betrayed in 1981 by an NSA employee spying for Russia, U.S. intelligence listened in on messages that the Russians didn't even feel a need to encrypt.

But more recently, in 2015, the Pentagon warned that it was more Russian ships operating closer to undersea cables. In 2016, there were fears that the Russian spy ship Yantar was interfering with underwater cables bringing connecting Syria to the Internet.

As with landlines, breaks in underwater cables are not uncommon, especially close to shore. But as the New York Times noted in 2015, ""what worries Pentagon planners most is that the Russians appear to be looking for vulnerabilities at much greater depths, where the cables are hard to monitor and breaks are hard to find and repair.""

If anything, the danger is only likely to increase. The proliferation of unmanned underwater vehicles—sea drones—has opened a new horizon of robots that can stealthily and cheaply destroy or eavesdrop on underwater cables.

The rapid expansion of the submarine cable network in the 21st century, driven by data demands, cloud computing, and the needs of hyperscalers like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, must contend with converging geopolitical, physical, and cyber threats. State actors pose the greatest threat in terms of sabotage and spying, followed by non-state actors like hacktivists and ransomware groups, who pose a less capable and lower likelihood threat to the networks and operating systems that submarine cables rely upon. Accidental damage from ships and fishing vessels is more frequent but less impactful.

Major geopolitical developments, specifically Russia's conflict with Ukraine, China's preparations for potential forceful unification with Taiwan, and the deterioration of US-China relations, are likely to fuel physical attacks and intelligence collection efforts against submarine cables. Notably, Russia has shown intent to map the submarine cable system in the Atlantic Ocean and North Sea, very likely for potential sabotage. The impact of these attacks will vary widely, ranging from intermittent traffic disruptions to widespread outages that take days or weeks to resolve, depending on the redundancy and resiliency of the affected network. State actors seeking an espionage edge will almost certainly target the entire submarine cable ecosystem for intelligence collection: landing station infrastructure, the submarine cables themselves, third-party providers, and the hardware and software that knits it all together.

The rise of Chinese state-owned enterprises as cable owners, operators, and producers has elevated concerns over digital surveillance, while the expanding ownership stakes by hyperscalers has brought forward questions about market monopolies and digital sovereignty.

---

March 30, 2018 / 6:58 AM EDT / AP

Russian ships are skulking around underwater communications cables, causing the U.S. and its allies to worry the Kremlin might be taking information warfare to new depths. Is Moscow interested in cutting or tapping the cables? Does it want the West to worry it might? Is there a more innocent explanation?

Unsurprisingly, Russia isn't saying.

But whatever Moscow's intentions, U.S. and Western officials are increasingly troubled by their rival's interest in the 400 fiber-optic cables that carry most of world's calls, emails and texts, as well as $10 trillion worth of daily financial transactions.

""We've seen activity in the Russian navy, and particularly undersea in their submarine activity, that we haven't seen since the '80s,"" Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of the U.S. European Command, told Congress this month.

Without undersea cables, a bank in Asian countries couldn't send money to Saudi Arabia to pay for oil. U.S. military leaders would struggle to communicate with troops fighting extremists in Afghanistan and the Middle East. A student in Europe wouldn't be able to Skype his parents in the United States.

All this information is transmitted along tiny glass fibers encased in undersea cables that, in some cases, are little bigger than a garden hose. All told, there are 620,000 miles of fiber-optic cable running under the sea, enough to loop around the earth nearly 25 times.

Most lines are owned by private telecommunications companies, including giants like Google and Microsoft. Their locations are easily identified on public maps, with swirling lines that look like spaghetti. While cutting one cable might have limited impact, severing several simultaneously or at choke points could cause a major outage.

The Russians ""are doing their homework and, in the event of a crisis or conflict with them, they might do rotten things to us,"" said Michael Kofman, a Russian military expert at nonprofit research group CNA Corp.

It's not Moscow's warfighting ships and submarines that are making NATO and U.S. officials uneasy. It's Russia's Main Directorate of Deep Sea Research, whose specialized surface ships, submarines, underwater drones and mini subs conduct reconnaissance, underwater salvage and other work.

One ship run by the directorate is the Yantar. It's a modest, 354-foot oceanographic vessel that holds a crew of about 60. It most recently was off South America's coast helping Argentina search for a lost submarine.

Parlamentskaya Gazeta, the Russian parliament's publication, last October said the Yantar has equipment ""designed for deep-sea tracking"" and ""connecting to top-secret communication cables."" The publication said that in September 2015, the Yantar was near Kings Bay, Georgia, home to a U.S. submarine base, ""collecting information about the equipment on American submarines, including underwater sensors and the unified (U.S. military) information network."" Rossiya, a Russian state TV network, has said the Yantar can not only connect to top-secret cables, but could cut them and ""jam underwater sensors with a special system.""

Russia's Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

There is no hard evidence that the ship is engaged in nefarious activity, said Steffan Watkins, an information technology security consultant in Canada tracking the ship. But he wonders what the ship is doing when it's stopped over critical cables or when its Automatic Identification System tracking transponder isn't on.

Of the Yantar's crew, he said: ""I don't think these are the actual guys who are doing any sabotage. I think they're laying the groundwork for future operations.""

Members of Congress are wondering, too.

Rep. Joe Courtney, a Connecticut Democrat on a House subcommittee on sea power, said of the Russians, ""The mere fact that they are clearly tracking the cables and prowling around the cables shows that they are doing something.""

Democratic Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, an Armed Services Committee member, said Moscow's goal appears to be to ""disrupt the normal channels of communication and create an environment of misinformation and distrust.""

The Yantar's movements have previously raised eyebrows.

On Oct. 18, 2016, a Syrian telecom company ordered emergency maintenance to repair a cable in the Mediterranean that provides internet connectivity to several countries, including Syria, Libya and Lebanon. The Yantar arrived in the area the day before the four-day maintenance began. It left two days before the maintenance ended. It's unknown what work it did while there.

Watkins described another episode on Nov. 5, 2016, when a submarine cable linking Persian Gulf nations experienced outages in Iran. Hours later, the Yantar left Oman and headed to an area about 60 miles west of the Iranian port city of Bushehr, where the cable runs ashore. Connectivity was restored just hours before the Yantar arrived on Nov. 9. The boat stayed stationary over the site for several more days.

Undersea cables have been targets before.

At the beginning of World War I, Britain cut a handful of German underwater communications cables and tapped the rerouted traffic for intelligence. In the Cold War, the U.S. Navy sent American divers deep into the Sea of Okhotsk off the Russian coast to install a device to record Soviet communications, hoping to learn more about the USSR's submarine-launched nuclear capability.

More recently, British and American intelligence agencies have eavesdropped on fiber optic cables, according to documents released by Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor.

In 2007, Vietnamese authorities confiscated ships carrying miles of fiber optic cable that thieves salvaged from the sea for profit. The heist disrupted service for several months. And in 2013, Egyptian officials arrested three scuba divers off Alexandria for attempting to cut a cable stretching from France to Singapore. Five years on, questions remain about the attack on a cable responsible for about a third of all internet traffic between Egypt and Europe.

Despite the relatively few publicly known incidents of sabotage, most outages are due to accidents.

Two hundred or so cable-related outages take place each year. Most occur when ship anchors snap cables or commercial fishing equipment snags the lines. Others break during tsunamis, earthquakes and other natural disasters.

But even accidental cuts can harm U.S. military operations.

In 2008 in Iraq, unmanned U.S. surveillance flights nearly screeched to a halt one day at Balad Air Base not because of enemy mortar attacks or dusty winds. An anchor had snagged a cable hundreds of miles away from the base, situated in the ""Sunni Triangle"" northwest of Baghdad.

The severed cable had linked controllers based in the United States with unmanned aircraft flying intelligence, surveillance and recognizance missions for coalition forces in the skies over Iraq, explained Ret. Air Force Col. Dave Lujan of Hampton, Virginia.

""Say you're operating a remote-controlled car and all of a sudden you can't control it,"" said Lujan, who was deputy commander of the 332nd Expeditionary Operations Group at the base when the little-publicized outage lasted for two to three days. ""That's a big impact,"" he said, describing how U.S. pilots had to fly the missions instead.","The article discusses the presence of Russian ships near undersea cables and raises concerns about the potential for these cables to be cut or tapped.

Russia’s modernised navy has often been spotted near to underwater communications cables in the Atlantic. The economic reliance on these cables makes them a prime target.

Britain’s economy is around 80 percent service-based and relies on underwater cables to conduct business. Peach told the Royal United Services Institute think tank: ""Imagine a scenario where those cables are cut or disrupted which would immediately and potentially catastrophically affect both our economy and other ways of living,”

""Therefore, we must continue to develop our maritime forces — with our allies — to match Russian fleet modernisation,""

Underwater cables are difficult to protect. A report by Policy Exchange found that 97 percent of international communications are conducted over undersea cables and they’re vulnerable to sabotage due to “minimal protection”.

These cables were often a target during Soviet times, and recent activity suggests they could be again in any offensive launched today. For perspective, these cables are responsible for around £7tn worth of financial transactions per day.

""We can do some things about it, but not enough because our anti-submarine warfare capability has been seriously neglected. The anti-submarine warfare package has been underfunded and has not been looked after well enough.”

**Defence spending cuts**

The UK’s current government, the Conservative Party, has been criticised for its austerity policies which have included significant cuts to defence spending. The opposition party, Labour, has accused the Conservatives of “shilly shallying around"" with defence spending after former military chiefs warned Britain is losing the ability to fight wars.

Labour MP Dan Jarvis, a war veteran who served in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo and Northern Ireland, said: “Tory MPs should not be trumpeting their record on defence. They should be embarrassed by the disgraceful damage their party has done to our armed forces.”

“Britain’s defences under Tory leadership are almost unrecognisable compared to how they were left by the last Labour government. Our Army has been seriously reduced, undermining our ability to react to a changing threat from state enemies and international terrorism.”

Army numbers have fallen from 102,000 to just below 80,000. The party has been afflicted by in-fighting after concerns the Army are nearly 4,000 full-time troops short of its target strength. Furthermore, a policy paper by the Henry Jackson Society indicates that full-time army numbers could be cut from 78,000 to 70,000 and savings totalling up to £20bn are being mooted by paring back numbers of Royal Marines, aircraft, and amphibious assault ships.

The same report says the UK must increase its spending on defence to three percent of GDP to counter rising global threats. James Rogers, who authored the Henry Jackson report, says in the face of a “revisionist Russia” that Britain needs to take military power more seriously and its “armed forces therefore require resources consummate with the new geopolitical reality.”

At a time when more than 95% of everything that moves on the global Internet passes through just 200 undersea fiber-optic cables, potential adversaries such as the US, Russia, China and Iran are focusing on these deep-sea information pipes as rich sources of intelligence as well as targets in war.

The weapons earmarked for the struggle include submarines, underwater drones, robots and specialized ships and divers. The new battlefield is also a gray legal zone: Current Law of the Sea conventions cover some aspects of undersea cables but not hostile acts.

There’s evidence that missions are already under way and that most big powers, including the US, are keen on engaging in such activities. Cables can also be attacked by terrorists and other non-state actors.

The damage from such hard-to-detect acts could be enormous, since a foe’s economy, in addition to military and diplomatic communications, could be blinded. As more nations exploit the Internet for political or military gain, it’s also clear that the tactical concept of undersea cables as critical assets to be attacked or defended is an idea whose time has come.

“In the most severe scenario of an all-out attack upon undersea cable infrastructure by a hostile actor the impact of connectivity loss is potentially catastrophic, but even relatively limited sabotage has the potential to cause significant economic disruption and damage,” a former commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, retired US Navy Admiral James Stavridis, wrote in the foreword to a recent report, “Undersea Cables: Indispensable, Insecure.”

It’s hard to overstate the importance and vulnerability of the world’s undersea cables. Rishi Sunak, the Conservative British member of Parliament who authored the December report, noted that the world’s undersea Internet cables carried about US$10 trillion of financial transactions in a single day as well as huge volumes of data, from e-mails to classified government-to-government information.

“Were the network to disappear, the entire capacity of the Earth’s satellite network could handle just 7% of the communications currently sent via cable from the United States alone,” Sunak wrote.

**Asian chokepoints**

Chokepoints where cables converge because of underwater terrain or other factors are especially vulnerable. One is the Luzon Strait near the Philippines, where all the undersea cables connecting Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan pass. The site’s vulnerability was underscored on December 26, 2006, when an undersea landslide severed six cables, temporarily disrupting Internet traffic throughout the region.

In the US, the bulk of trans-Atlantic Internet bandwidth comes ashore at a few sites within a 50-kilometer radius of New York City.

The contours of the new battlefield are enormous: Submarine cables can hug the ocean bottom only a few meters from the surface or straddle abysses as deep as Mount Everest is tall.

The locations of the world’s cables are also well mapped and available online, making them prey for specialized subs, ships, divers or something as simple as grappling hooks.

“Protection of the undersea cables that are an essential – and vulnerable – part of the global economy is yet another potential responsibility for a US Navy that is dangerously overstretched,” Joseph Callo, a naval authority and retired rear admiral in the US Navy Reserve, told Asia Times.

[US intelligence officials contend](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/world/europe/russian-presence-near-undersea-cables-concerns-us.html) that Russia is the chief offender in the new cable war. They have publicly disclosed that Russian submarines are “aggressively operating” near the Atlantic cables that serve the US mainland, as part of an asymmetric-warfare approach.

**US has spy submarine**

However, there are signs that the United States may be engaging in similar activities. In September, the US media reported that the USS Jimmy Carter, a Seawolf-class nuclear submarine equipped for intelligence missions, had returned to its base in Washington state flying a Jolly Roger pirate flag beside the US flag.

Hoisting the skull and crossbones in the US submarine service signals the successful completion of a mission. What was the Jimmy Carter up to? The US Navy didn’t say. But some analysts speculated that the sub, which carries remotely operated vehicles and SEAL (Sea, Air and Land) teams, might have been placing or removing taps on undersea cables.

Covert Shores, a specialist website dedicated to analysis of maritime special forces and submarines, alleged in an updated article in August that the Russian Navy had been operating an advanced spy ship called the Yantar that is suspected of tapping into undersea Internet cables and carrying out other intelligence work on the sea floor.

Yantar “can host two deep submergence submarines for undersea engineering missions,” wrote H I Sutton, the author of the Covert Shores article. “These missions are thought to include cable cutting, laying of taps on undersea cables, removing other countries’ taps (‘delousing’) and related intelligence missions. She may also perform other special missions such as recovery of sensitive equipment from crashed aircraft or test missiles.”

The military website says the Yantar has been observed loitering off the US coast, Cuba, Turkey, Northern Cyprus and other sites where there are key undersea cable connections.

Rob Huebert, a senior fellow at the University of Calgary’s Center for Military and Strategic Studies, points to reports that the Russians have a special mini-submarine launched in 2003 that dives to a very deep range. He says the sub, variously called the Losharik or Project 201 and AS-12, is suspected of being able to carry out cable missions, though this is unconfirmed.

“If the Russians have this, it would be highly likely that both the Chinese and Americans have the same ability,” Huebert told Asia Times.

**Is China involved?**

Actual evidence of Chinese or Iranian participation in cable-focused espionage activities is spotty. The US side points to Chinese activities in the South China Sea and Iranian actions in the Persian Gulf where civilian vessels rather than easily observed military ships with “gray hulls” are being used to carry out unknown activities.

Stavridis noted in his foreword that underwater cables are easy targets for unmarked civilian vessels that can do their work with conventional, non-military technology.

There’s a propaganda spin to such US allegations. But both Beijing and Tehran can be expected to engage in such activities if they see potential foes such as the US developing this capability.

Stavridis says a solution for the US side is to create “dark cables” that aren’t operational but can be kept in reserve for emergencies. He says another option is to engage Russia and others in bolstering international legal protections for undersea cables and other fiber-optic grids.

**Past incidents**

Mysterious disruptions of submarine cables have been reported for years. A flurry of incidents occurred in 2008. Five high-speed Internet cables serving the Middle East and India were hit, resulting in major Internet slowdowns. Speculation was that some damage was caused by a dragging ship anchor near Alexandria, Egypt – though officials said there were no surface vessels in the vicinity at the time.

The Egyptian government also arrested three scuba divers near Alexandria in March 2013 after they were allegedly caught cutting an undersea cable serving the Mediterranean region, causing a noticeable Internet slowdown. The divers claimed they cut the cable by accident. But Egyptian officials never explained what motivated the trio.

The incidents stirred a host of conspiracy theories, including allegations that the US National Security Agency was tapping Internet traffic or that local governments were deliberately slowing online access for protesters using smartphones.

Introduction**  
Contrary to popular belief, the global internet is largely comprised of a network of data cables linking states and continents and not satellite links propelling data through the air. In communications between continents, approximately 99% of all telecommunications is transmitted via a network of around 400 underwater, submarine cables. For example, to send an email from Boston to Dublin, the GTT Atlantic Cable would route your message under the Atlantic Ocean through Nova Scotia, Northern Ireland, and London before arriving in Dublin. This process would take place nearly instantaneously but traverse hundreds of miles of fiber optic cable under the Atlantic Ocean.  

These undersea cables are only about the size of a garden hose but represent billions of dollars of productivity and information. If a ship were to drop anchor in the wrong location and sever a cable, internet service could be cut to an entire country. If a rogue agent elected to cut the cables to the United States, an estimated $10 trillion in daily financial transfers and vast amounts of data would be clogged up. Because damage to submarine cables is so devastating, the international community has devised a number of conventions and domestic protections to protect against cable damage.  

More insidiously, however, these cables are also at risk of hacking and intelligence gathering because so much data flows through them. States can use submarines to make small slits in submarine cables and insert listening and data collection devices. These spying states then collect all the information that flows through the cables: every overseas telephone call, email, financial transfer, or data upload that passes through the internet from one country to another is collected. Encryption of information that passes through these cables somewhat protects against intelligence gathering, but sophisticated operators can often break encryption and can nevertheless obtain useful information through the metadata embedded in encrypted transmissions. This massive amount of information provides valuable military, economic, and personal information to the hacking country. This hacking, however, is also a violation of citizens’ privacy and a violation of the hacked states’ economic and military interests.  

Out of concern for this sort of hacking, in 2020 the U.S. blocked Google and Facebook from turning on a submarine cable linking the U.S. and Hong Kong. Although the 8,000 mile cable had already been laid and hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on its development, the U.S. was too concerned about potential Chinese intelligence pilfering to let the cable go live. The decision dramatically demonstrates the U.S.’s fears around submarine cable hacking have grown to exceptional new heights. And the U.S. government’s fears are not misplaced. In 2013, the British spy agency the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) was found to secretly have tapped into undersea cables to gather information. In 2015, U.S. sensors detected Russian submarines near undersea cables raising concerns. And during the Cold War, the U.S. tapped into Soviet undersea cables and gathered critical intelligence as part of Operation Ivy Bells.  

As the world becomes increasingly interconnected and states increasingly rely on the internet economically, hacking into internet infrastructure becomes a greater threat. The U.S., for example, has undertaken expensive and extensive efforts to remove Huawei from its domestic telecommunication infrastructure to prevent the Chinese government from spying domestically. Undersea cables, however, are not so easily protected. Undersea cables are expensive to lay, difficult to replace, and often traverse international waters over which states do not have exclusive domain.  

Even with such a large threat, there is an open question as to whether states can protect against submarine cable hacking. The fundamental question this Comment seeks to answer is whether states have any recourse or protections against submarine cable hacking by foreign states under public international law. This Comment argues the increasingly recognized international right to privacy can provide grounds for protecting against submarine cable hacking and that states can enforce this right through dispute resolution mechanisms for the high seas.  

This Comment proceeds in five sections to develop this answer. Section II provides a brief overview of the technology behind submarine cables and the methods used in hacking these cables. Section III evaluates current attitudes in the international community with respect to submarine cable hacking and explains why norms around privacy, combined with the incredible resources required to protect cables from hacking, may lead to a shift in states’ treatment of submarine cable hacking.  

Section IV explores the history of international treaties and conventions surrounding submarine cables and the high seas. Section V summarizes current public international law related to cyber operations and hacking and discusses the emergence of a newly recognized international right to privacy with respect to telecommunications and personal data. Section VI discusses current scholarly responses to submarine cable hacking to situate this Comment’s solution in present scholarship. And in Section VII, I propose a novel solution addressing the problem of submarine cable hacking using the international right to privacy adjudicated through dispute resolution mechanisms developed for the high seas. The use of the international right to privacy and this dispute resolution body is presently underdiscussed by scholars. This solution further advances the right to privacy as integral to protect against submarine cable hacking and describes how shifts in attitudes toward privacy may contribute to the creation of norms against surveillance hacking.  

**II. Technical Primer on Hacking and Submarine Cables**  
This Section describes the network of submarine cables that makes up the modern internet, the technical elements of modern submarine cable hacking techniques, and the possibility of damage by submarine cable hacking. This information is relevant to subsequent possible solutions around submarine cable hacking because international treaties require some protections against incidental or intentional damage to submarine cables, as discussed in Section IV.  

Most of the internet is formed through a network of undersea submarine cables. About the size of a garden hose, these cables are buried just under the ocean floor by submarine-cable laying ships and transmit internet data between countries. While there are some legacy cables that transmit primarily telephone or telegraph information, the majority of modern cables are fiber optic cables that can transmit dozens of Terabytes of data per second. While some cables are specially created for military and intelligence transmission purposes, the majority of cables are general in use and transmit commercial, government, and private commercial correspondence simultaneously.  

Because laying and operating a cable across large bodies of water is so costly, most cables were historically financed, laid, and operated by a consortium of multiple owners. For example, the U.S., Japan, and Australia agreed in 2020 to jointly finance a cable link to the Pacific island nation of Palau at a cost of $30 billion. Despite this history, individual companies or governments increasingly financed and laid submarine cables. For example, in 2020 Google announced it was financing and constructing its own cable linking the U.S., the United Kingdom, and Spain.  

Once laid, cables are maintained and operated by the financing consortium or the private company financing the cable project. These cable operators are responsible for maintenance and repairs for any damage to the cable. Due to their length, most modern cables are outfitted with fault monitoring systems that can detect cable breaks or points of damage for repair.  

States are capable of spying on submarine cables. As discussed below, because the hacking of cables requires specialized equipment including submarines, most experts are concerned with government-sponsored hacking attempts. Third-party and private actors, however, are still considered a risk to submarine cables. When four cables linking Europe and the Middle East were simultaneously damaged, many officials and commercial operators alleged private actors had cut the cables. Although more sophisticated technology is required to hack a cable compared to destroying one, the threat of terrorists hacking a submarine cable remains even if not manifest to date.  

In general, the process by which intelligence agencies tap into cables is highly secretive. There are some indications, however, as to how it is done. Some reports indicate states use specially designed submarines equipped with devices to splice into cables. In this “splicing method,” the submarine, having broken through the protective coating, installs listening devices within the fiber optic cable to collect transmitted data. Some commentators, however, cast doubt on this method due to the possibility of a cable operator detecting a break in data transmission.","The article discusses submarine cables extensively, addressing their significance in global telecommunications and the potential consequences of physical damage (such as cutting) and hacking.

It mentions that severing a cable could disrupt internet service and financial transactions, indicating that it treats the topic as central.

**Author:** Robert Beckman  
**Content:**  
Submarine cables are critical to the world economy. They form the basis of the global telecommunications network, the Internet, E-commerce and the world’s financial and security systems. Natural disasters, fishing activities and shipping activities pose a constant threat to submarine cables. It is in the interest of every State to protect submarine cables and to ensure that broken or damaged cables are repaired as quickly as possible. However, despite their crucial role to both the economy and security of all States, many governments lack awareness on the various legal, policy and security issues which arise from the laying, protection and repair of submarine cables.  

The legal regime governing submarine cables is set out in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). This paper will outline the UNCLOS legal regime, and point out the areas where its provisions are no longer adequate to protect submarine cables. It will also speculate on the reasons why the legal regime governing submarine cables has been neglected, and set out what measures should be taken by States to address the gaps and loopholes in the current legal regime.  

The relevance of UNCLOS: The first convention on submarine cables was the 1884 Convention for the Protection of Submarine Cables. It was concluded on 14 March 1884 and entered into force on 1 May 1888. Although about 40 States eventually became parties, the only Asian State that is a party is Japan.  

Under UNCLOS, coastal States have sovereignty in the 12 nautical mile belt of sea adjacent to their coast known as the territorial sea. Their sovereignty extends to the seabed and subsoil below the territorial sea as well as to the air space above it.  

Article 87 of UNCLOS provides that the freedom of the high seas includes the freedom to lay submarine cables. Article 112 provides that all States are entitled to lay submarine cables on the bed of the high seas beyond the continental shelf.  

**Conclusion:** The article emphasizes the need for greater awareness and legal protections for submarine cables to ensure their security and functionality in the global economy.","The article 'Submarine Cables – A Neglected Area of the Law of the Sea' by Robert Beckman discusses submarine cables extensively, covering their critical role in global telecommunications, the legal framework governing them under UNCLOS, and the threats they face.

Indeed, Stephen Malphrus, Chief of Staff to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, recently noted, “When communication networks go down, the financial services sector does not grind to a halt, rather it snaps to a halt.” Even though there are hundreds of cables crossing the global seabed, there are just not enough undersea communication network redundancies available to handle the vast amount of bandwidth needed to keep global banking transactions in check.

Destruction of submarine cables can cripple the world economy to include the global financial market and/or Department of Defense (DoD). An example which reflects the importance of this strategic communication capability took place on December 26, 2006, when a powerful earthquake off Southern Taiwan cut 9 cables and took 11 repair ships 49 days to restore. The earthquake affected Internet links, financial markets, banking, airline bookings and general communications in China, Hong Kong, India, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan and the Philippines. When a cable loses service, it has a definite, but difficult impact to the global financial sector. The International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) legal advisor estimates that interruptions of underwater fiber optics communications systems have a financial impact excess of $1.5 million per hour. These estimates target operators that utilize cable bandwidth for day-to-day operations and companies or government entities that own bandwidth on the disrupted cable.

Submarine cables represent critical communications infrastructure, as they form the backbone of the Internet and global e-commerce. Such cables, typically consisting of optical fibers laid along the ocean floor in a bundle no larger than a garden hose, carry over 95 percent of transoceanic voice and data communication. U.S. telecom companies have worked rapidly to meet exploding consumer appetite for data, increasing the total circuit capacity of transoceanic cables landing in the U.S. by more than 1,000 fold since 1995.

There is no substitute for these underwater cables in case of damage. The earth’s satellites can carry no more than seven percent of U.S. international voice and data traffic. But worldwide, nearly 100 cable outages occur each year. The vast majority of cable outages are caused by bottom trawling fishing, dredging, and ship anchoring. Occasionally, cables are taken in an act of piracy, as occurred in 2007 when individuals in commercial vessels from Vietnam stole over 100 miles of cables on the high seas. Cable outages may disrupt governments, financial markets, and business operations and require costly repairs.

Ambiguity, coupled with our extreme reliance on undersea infrastructure, was on display in late January and early February 2008. Four undersea telecommunication cables were mysteriously cut within the course of two days, crippling Internet access across wide swaths of the Middle East and India. Two cable breaks were in the Mediterranean--one near Alexandria, Egypt, and the other in the waters off Marseille, France. The third break was thirty-five miles off the coast of Dubai and the fourth was along a cable linking the United Arab Emirates to Qatar. Most telecommunication experts and operators deemed sabotage unlikely, believing instead that ship anchors had severed the cables when heavy storms swept through the region. Nevertheless, the Egyptian Ministry of Communications refuted the presence of any ships near the Mediterranean cable cuts. Moreover, the improbable incidence of four cuts in 48 hours fueled speculation about military involvement. At the very least, this episode highlights how relatively small damage to undersea cables can instantly affect millions of people, and how a stealthy underwater attack- ambiguous and non-attributive in nature-could deal such a crippling blow.

In the end, whatever vigor is applied towards cyber security, and whatever balance is struck for internet freedoms should be matched by securing the very cables that transport this life-blood of commerce. Likewise, investment in energy independence should correspond to the security of the very arteries that enable and spur offshore energy exploration.","The article 'Underseas cables are vital to global economy' discusses the critical role of undersea cables, including direct references to their potential disruptions and the severe implications of such events.

It provides specific examples, such as the 2006 earthquake that cut multiple cables, and emphasizes the impact on global connectivity and financial systems, fulfilling the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables."

But those cables may soon no longer be enough to satisfy the global demand for bandwidth between the two continents, according to research out today from TeleGeography. The research firm estimates that bandwidth requirements will grow 33 percent between 2008 and 2015, and trans-Atlantic capacity will be exhausted by 2014.

The report also notes that the wave of bankruptcies caused by the oversupply of trans-Atlantic fiber during the boom artificially lowered the cost of providing bandwidth on those cables because many of the pipe providers were able to erase their cable construction debts. That’s good for the current customers who now pay lower prices for transporting their bits, but it means current prices don’t take into account the construction cost of the cables. So future customers will likely see some price increases on wholesale bandwidth as pipe operators add more capacity, and find themselves paying for expensive optical infrastructure. It’s a good thing that this undersea cable buildout is expected to be cheaper than the last one.

From the report:
> Consequently, current wholesale rates of approximately $14,000 per month for a 10 Gbps wavelength reflect only the incremental cost of the optical equipment needed to provision the circuit, but not the cost of cable construction. “Trans-Atlantic cable operators and wholesale buyers are facing a slow-motion crisis,” said TeleGeography analyst Alan Mauldin. “The cost of circuits on a new cable built today would be far higher than prices prevailing in the market.”

TeleGeography argues that while 2014 is still five years off, lengthy cable financing and construction cycles mean that carriers must confront this challenge soon. Cable operators may be able to extend their existing infrastructure by using 40 Gbps transmission line rates, but these technologies are unproven on a commercial long-haul submarine cable, and will only postpone the need to lay new fiber.","The article 'The Coming Trans-Atlantic Bandwidth Crunch' discusses the implications of undersea cables, referencing them directly and exploring their historical context and future challenges.

The UK must do more to protect the indispensable, yet insecure Internet infrastructure provided by undersea cables, urges Rishi Sunak MP in a new report published by Policy Exchange.  

The report ‘Undersea Cables: Indispensable, insecure’ says that 97 percent of global communications and $10 trillion in daily financial transactions are transmitted through cables lying deep beneath the ocean. Undersea cables are the indispensable infrastructure of our time, essential to our modern life and digital economy, yet they are inadequately protected and highly vulnerable to attack at sea and on land, from both hostile states and terrorists.  

US intelligence officials have spoken of Russian submarines ‘aggressively operating’ near Atlantic cables as part of its broader interest in unconventional methods of warfare. When Russia annexed Crimea, one of its first moves was to sever the main cable connection to the outside world.  

Undersea cables come ashore in just a few remote, coastal locations. These landing sites are critical national infrastructure but often have minimal protection, making them vulnerable to terrorism.  

The report recommends that:  
* The next UK Strategic Defence and Security Review should specifically address threats to Britain’s security from attacks on undersea cable infrastructure;  
* The Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure should quickly review and improve security at UK landing sites where cables come ashore;  
* Britain and NATO must ensure their maritime resources are adequate to deal with this new threat to our security;  
* The UK government should work with private communications companies to install more backup ‘dark cables’ and improve monitoring at sea;  
* The UK should follow the example of Australia and New Zealand and establish Cable Protection Zones around the highest value communications corridors;  
* The UK must lead efforts to develop a new international treaty to protect undersea cables.

"Submarine Cables and Naval Warfare Law","Explores legal frameworks governing submarine cables, detailing military implications and potential internet access disruptions.","https://www.lawfareblog.com/submarine-cables-law-naval-warfare","2023-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","",Yes,"James Kraska","Washington, District of Columbia, USA","2500","2023-02-06","English","The Lawfare Institute","No technology is as profoundly important to the global economy as the internet, which is dependent on the security of a vast network of some 750,000 miles of seabed cables that criss-cross the oceans’ depths. The interdependence of global submarine communication systems means that a break in one cable can have cascading effects on internet access to distant states. While the rules to protect this critical infrastructure in peacetime should be refurbished, the need to further develop the rules to secure this global infrastructure during periods of armed conflict is perhaps even more compelling. Although several peacetime treaties protect submarine cables from disruption and criminal acts, albeit weakly, the rules that apply during naval war are even more antiquated. Because the law of naval warfare is principally based on custom and state practice rather than treaties, there is considerable uncertainty over how submarine cables would fare in conflict at sea.

The internet facilitates $10 trillion in international financial transactions daily; submarine cables are the backbone of this distributed, global infrastructure. The critical importance of cables underscores the debate within Western states over the prudence of working with the Chinese communications conglomerate Huawei Marine. Russia and China both view submarine cables as strategic assets and could either tap them or sever them in any future conflict. Russia’s surface ship Yantar, for example, is monitored by Western naval forces since it is outfitted with cable-cutting gear and deep-sea submersibles.

The principal treaty governing submarine cables, adopted in 1884, sets forth an enlightened and balanced approach that is still followed today. The treaty is supplemented by the 1958 Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf and the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). While Article 2 of the 1884 treaty criminalizes the breaking or injury of submarine cables done intentionally or through 'culpable negligence' that results in disruption of telecommunication services, Article 4 requires cable owners and operators to indemnify each other for damaged cables and, under Article 7, pay for lost anchors and fishing nets sacrificed in order to avoid cutting a cable.

The 1958 convention recognizes that coastal states have sovereign rights over the resources of the seabed. These rights inhere to the coastal state, regardless of its ability to 'occupy' the seabed, access the resources or exercise control over the area. This recognition of coastal state rights codified the U.S. claim in the 1945 Truman Proclamation, which had crystallized into customary international law. Article 4 of that treaty ensures that coastal states may not impede the laying or maintenance of submarine cables or pipelines on their continental shelves. Laying submarine cables is a high seas freedom, and Article 2(4) of the treaty recognizes that all states have a right to do so, while exercising 'reasonable regard' for other states—such as the coastal state. The act of laying submarine cables is also a high seas right under the peacetime rules reflected in Article 112 of UNCLOS. States are required to adopt necessary laws and regulations to address willful or culpably negligent damage to cables in accordance with Article 113. Articles 114 and 115 of UNCLOS reflect the long-standing regime of liability and indemnity and are derived from the 1884 treaty. Even in peacetime, as set forth by the rules reflected in UNCLOS, the submarine cable system is fragile. The International Cable Protection Committee—an industry group that represents 97 percent of submarine cables—has reported coastal state delays and exorbitant costs, such as those imposed by India and Indonesia, that hinder undersea cable repairs on their continental shelves. China has a lax record of enforcement against its fishing vessels that cut submarine cables.

While Article 10 of the 1884 treaty specifies that warships and other government vessels have a right to verify the nationality of a merchant vessel if it is suspected of having broken a submarine cable, this provision is a departure from the concept of exclusive flag state jurisdiction over ships, as embodied in Article 92 of UNCLOS. Still, it is also possible to suggest that Article 10 persists even now by virtue of Article 30 of the 1958 convention, which states that prior agreements already in force shall continue. Thus, the rule that states may approach and visit merchant vessels to investigate cut or damaged cables may still apply to states party to the 1884 convention and the 1958 convention, or perhaps more broadly under customary international law.

While these peacetime instruments are rather dated and would benefit from new agreements to increase penalties for tampering and other criminal acts that disrupt their operation, the rules that apply during armed conflict are perhaps even more uncertain. The 1907 Hague Regulations forbid seizure or destruction of submarine cables connecting an occupied territory to a neutral territory, except in the case of 'absolute necessity.' Furthermore, cut cables must be restored and compensation paid once the conflict is over. Not only does this exception practically negate the rule, but the regulations themselves apply only to war on land—occupied land at that—and are silent on destruction of cables in the open sea. State practice is clear, however, that cables connecting two points in enemy territory (or two enemy states) may be cut.

Article 15 of the 1884 treaty states that the rules on submarine cables do not 'affect the liberty of action' of belligerent states during armed conflict. This is amplified in Rule 37 in the influential San Remo Manual on the Law Applicable to Conflict at Sea, which states that parties to a conflict shall 'take care' to avoid damaging submarine cables and pipelines laid on the seabed that serve neutral states. Article 54 of the 1913 Oxford Manual of the Laws of Naval War prohibits cutting cables in neutral waters connecting neutral states with an enemy state. Such cables may be cut on the high seas only if the belligerent state doing so is conducting an effective blockade of the enemy state. Yet, even the Oxford Manual cautions that seizure or destruction of a submarine cable may not be done unless there is an 'absolute necessity.' This rule applies without discrimination as to nationality of the owner of the cable, whether a natural person or corporate entity. Recently, the 2020 Oslo Manual on Select Topics on the Law of Armed Conflict recognized in Rule 67 that states that have laid submarine cables or pipelines, or whose nationals have done so, are 'entitled to take protective measures' to prevent or terminate 'harmful interference' of them.

It is unclear, however, the extent to which the rules set forth in the Oxford, San Remo and Oslo manuals, weak as they are, reflect the understanding of states. In short, the content of the law is murky. Further, the willingness of states to acknowledge even the rather circumspect restraints from customary law on their conduct during armed conflict at sea is doubtful. And while legal practitioners and scholars might devise some clarity, such as through the ongoing revision process of the San Remo Manual, the challenge of more crisply defining rights and duties of states concerning submarine cables is daunting. In the meantime, states may expect that adversaries’ plans to disrupt international submarine cables during naval warfare are limited only by their national laws and their imagination.","The article 'Submarine Cables in the Law of Naval Warfare' extensively discusses submarine cables, including their critical role in global communications and the implications of their disruption.

It mentions the potential for cutting these cables in military contexts, the cascading effects on internet access, and the relevant legal frameworks governing their protection.

These elements confirm that the article focuses on cut sea cables as a central theme rather than a minor mention."

*Eoin Micheál McNamara*  
*Published Date: 08/28/2024*  

Undersea infrastructure is vital in a global economy powered by data. 99% of the world’s data is transmitted through a global network of subsea cables. An estimated USD 10 trillion in financial transactions alone traverses these vast cable networks each day. As great power tensions escalate, undersea infrastructure serving the Euro-Atlantic community has emerged as an attractive target for hybrid interference, meaning that the security of this infrastructure should be a NATO priority.

Economic logic indicates that undersea infrastructure will remain vital for both global commerce and security into the foreseeable future. However, mitigating risk by finding secure alternative transit for these undersea supplies entails complicated economic and logistic predicaments.

Since 1982, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) differentiates between the territorial waters of maritime countries, international waters, and Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs). Limited to 12 nautical miles from a country’s coastline, territorial waters bestow full sovereign rights, but specific responsibilities for security are much vaguer under UNCLOS for the vast sections of undersea infrastructure intersecting international waters or the EEZs of multiple countries.

Harsh maritime conditions offer some coincidental protection. Many undersea communication cables connecting North America and Europe cross the mid-Atlantic where the average depth is approximately 3,600 metres. This makes it arduous but not impossible for a submarine to interfere. This vast network offers its own form of protection. In the Euro-Atlantic area, density ensures that hostile actors seeking to cause a serious, effective data outage must coordinate simultaneous aggression at multiple undersea cable nodes.

While NATO militaries have an operational advantage in the North Atlantic, Russia’s hybrid tactics can still target cracks where cooperation between EU and NATO members is less developed.

Vulnerabilities with maritime infrastructure were starkly highlighted by sabotage to the Nord Stream pipelines in 2022, spurring the creation of NATO’s Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell (the Cell) in February 2023. The Cell will map vulnerabilities, and coordinate efforts between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector.

Much undersea infrastructure is owned and/or operated by private companies, sometimes making the responsibility for security unclear between governments and commercial entities. Public-private partnerships are vital in reducing undersea vulnerabilities. The Cell is an important framework to bridge cooperation between governments and industry.

Across 32 Allied countries, NATO faces a multifaceted maritime security environment. While geopolitical tensions rose, the Nord Stream sabotage prompted concerns that similar incidents were set to spiral. NATO must balance this with support for southern members at risk from destabilisation in neighbouring regions connected by maritime zones that facilitate flows in narcotics, illicit weapons and organised crime.

Russia’s plans for major naval drills on the southerly edge of Ireland’s EEZ in February 2022 received global attention shortly before Moscow began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Hybrid operations blur civilian and military domains. In April 2023, Ireland observed suspicious Russian-registered cargo and repair vessels with equipment capable of undersea damage in the Irish EEZ, where important transatlantic cables pass.","The article discusses the critical role of undersea cables in global data transmission and highlights vulnerabilities associated with them, particularly in the context of hybrid threats from state actors.

It addresses the risks of damage and disruption to these cables, although it does not use the exact phrase 'cut sea cables'.

Over 750 miles of undersea cables anchored to the sea floor connect the world. These cables cross seas and oceans, traversing international waters and national boundaries. But in this era, more so than any other, knowledge is power. Ultimately, those who own these cables will be able to control and monitor the information that passes through them. Not bound to any one territory, who has the right to control these cables?

**Digital Gold**

Internet cables are protected as though they contain gold, and to some extent, they do. Over 95% of precious data flows through those fibres every day—including government correspondence, user profiles, and banking information. Not only are they routinely inspected for external damage from dropped anchors, earthquakes, or even shark bites, but they are also patrolled by their owners to deter any information tapping from foreign governments.

All this is done through the collaboration of private investors, tech companies, and governments. Projects are backed by governments or state-owned companies, and resources are poured into the process of laying down the cables; hundreds of millions of dollars and the most advanced tools and materials all dedicated to building the backbone of the modern world. The operation takes years; authorities need to map the safest route, damage-proof the cables, dig the trenches, and lay down the cables. All this investment is worth it, for they will give access to information abroad and the potential to control the flow of data.

**A key for espionage**

Tapping undersea cables for espionage is not a new idea. Back in the 1970s, submarines were sent on missions like Operation Ivy Bells. Troops were sent down to the bottom of the Sea of Okhotsk in Soviet territorial waters to find a five-inch diameter cable that carried communications between military bases. They installed a 20-foot long listening device on the cable to record Soviet messages. The tap was eventually discovered, and that specific mission had been compromised.

Such operations could still be ongoing beneath the ocean without us knowing. However, with tech giants quickly gaining control of more and more cables, there could be a new way to spy on other countries. Partnerships or deals with these companies can easily give governments access to the information that flows through the cables, giving Facebook and Google even more leverage than they already have. With state backing and investment, tech giants could control and sell more information, and they could even persuade governments since they own the cables that deliver their secrets. For example, Google could restrict access to information vital for national security interests if governments refuse to give them more tax exemptions.

**Cable Ownership**

These cables run through international territory, muddying the question of ownership. It begs the question: are sections of these cables subject to the local laws of the territories they cross?

Private companies will argue that they’re private property and thus subject to solely the company’s control. However, they still must comply with international laws and treaties regarding marine territory. According to Article 87 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), states have the freedom to lay submarine cables and pipelines in international waters, and only areas that cross into sovereign territory (the Exclusive Economic Zone [EEZ] or continental shelf) are subject to restrictions. Article 112 stipulates that the freedom to lay down cables must be subject to the rights of other states to do the same. Once in the sovereign state’s territorial sea (12 nautical miles from the coast), companies who piloted the project are required to possess various permits, licenses, and environmental agreements according to local laws and international treaties before operating within the country.

While ownership of the cables themselves vary from company to company (state-owned or private), tech giants like Facebook and Google are quickly taking over the seas. By 2020, both companies will own about 29% of the cables that run throughout the world; they even own a couple of whole cables from end-to-end. For instance, Google currently owns the entirety of the Curie cable, which runs from Chile to Los Angeles.

With tech giants taking over, international and local laws need to be updated to ensure that the sovereignty of the different states the cables cross is protected. It’s a unique position they currently occupy: the cables are privately-owned but are allowed to traverse sovereign territory. States are subject to the international treaties they signed, but private companies’ hands are not as bound. UNCLOS awards states the right to lay down internet cables, and this extends to their residents. However, since cable ownership cannot be determined easily by flying a flag, it’s difficult to hold a single company accountable. While they still need permits to lay down the cables, the information they collect can be considered property of the owner. This gives private companies significant leverage over governments. If current regulations are not updated, tech companies have the potential to gain a monopoly over our data, and governments may find it more and more difficult to control their behaviour.

**China and the South China Sea**

All this considered, China’s presence in the South China Sea is even more intimidating. As they continue to take control over the various islands in the area, they will be able to lay down their own network cables away from the eyes of the international community. Their goals to expand their 5G networks, headed by Huawei, will give the Chinese government even more control over the information that flows into and out of the country. The infamous Great Firewall can be expanded and improved further if the state has complete control over the internet cables that source internet traffic. Tapping the cables will no longer be necessary for espionage if the state owns the whole thing.

The Huawei Marine Networks has already begun to lay down 100 submarine cables across the world, and it completed a 4,000-mile cable last year that runs from Brazil to Cameroon. China Unicom, the company that owns the cable, was able to win the bidding because of the subsidies they received from the government. Possession of the South China Sea could mean the control over the data that flows between surrounding countries. A monopoly on the network can give China the intelligence and leverage necessary to control such regions. China, however, is simply taking a page from American books. Former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed PRISM to the public: a program wherein the U.S. government collected user data from various internet companies, and they could do so without a warrant. Global superpowers know that intelligence is the key to control, so they have been working with telecommunication companies for years, whether it be through under-the-table deals or direct partnerships. The danger with China’s case, however, is the way they are attempting to circumvent international regulations and norms.

**Aunty Beeb adds:**

> 
> The SMW 4 and FLAG cables were among five undersea cables damaged earlier this year in January and February in the Mediterranean, launching a flurry of conspiracy theories before investigations revealed that at least one of the cuts was caused by a ship’s anchor.

**Jonathan M. Gitlin worries for international sanity:**

**Stacey Higginbotham says the Maltese are [cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltese_Cross):** _[You’re fired -Ed.]_

In Malta’s case, an agreement with Vodafone to share its cable kept the physical infrastructure from staying out. But as the Sprint/Cogent peering fight proved, when those agreements fail, the web is vulnerable in a way roads are not.

**_Behrooz examines the evidence:**

> Cables going to very close shore landing points between similar destinations tend to be pretty close together, saves significantly on the survey costs. The … timing of the outages … and the relative proximity of the cable courses suggests either anchor drag or someone who cares enough to make it look that way.

**So _fuzzyfuzzyfungus theorizes, conspiratorially:**

There must be somebody, if you ask around quietly, who would be willing to set up a grubby little shipping company with no real assets worth suing for and have their rusty crap freighter drag an anchor across whatever bit of seabed needs some accidental scraping.

**But Mike “Xaositecte” Avelli thinks not:**

> Even though it never got reported on, the [February] cable cuts were a serious nuisance to American troops stationed in Afghanistan and Iraq at the time too.

"Underwater Communication Cables: Vulnerabilities and Protective Measures Relevant to India Part-2","Examines vulnerabilities of submarine cables with legal protections and implications for telecommunications in India.","https://maritimeindia.org/underwater-communication-cables-vulnerabilities-and-protective-measures-relevant-to-india-part-2","2023-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","Admin",Yes,-,"New Delhi, India","3000","2023-06-02","English","National Maritime Foundation (NMF)","This is the second and concluding part of an article on submarine communications cable systems relevant to India. Part-1 focussed upon providing an overview of these systems and the vulnerabilities to which they are subject. This concluding segment not only highlights the inadequate protection that these systems receive under international law but also under India’s domestic legislation. To mitigate the several ensuing vulnerabilities, it strongly recommends that submarine communications cables landing in India be included within India’s “Critical Information Infrastructure System” (CIIS), and that India exercise prescriptive jurisdiction over such submarine cables even under the High Seas, under the principle of “protective jurisdiction”. It is hoped that the two parts, taken in aggregate, would be useful to Indian policy-makers and practitioners, as also to legal academic and research institutes in India and the larger Indian Ocean Region. This second part specifically addresses legal authorities of the Indian Navy/Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of External Affairs, as well as India’s national security apparatus.

**Protection under International Law**

Where legal protection to underwater/ submarine communication cables is concerned, the basic issue revolves about the exercise of “jurisdiction”. While surveillance, alerting and warning systems are necessary to prevent human activity from damaging cables in the first place, the existence and robustness of rules and enforcement mechanisms required to ensure deterrence are equally important. However, since much of the damage can occur outside the territory of the concerned State, extending a State’s jurisdiction, especially criminal jurisdiction, is problematic.

Submarine cables (albeit in the form of telegraph cables) have, of course, been around since the 1850s. As early as 1884, the international community understood the need to reach a consensus to protect these cables even in areas outside national jurisdiction. Thus, the _“Convention for the Protection of Submarine Telegraph Cables, 1884”_ focussed upon interference with telegraph cables. The jury is still out on whether this treaty has a fundamental norm-creating character and whether it has the force of customary international law. The non-reliance of many articles in the 1884 Convention by the International Law Commission while developing UNCLOS 1982, as also the small number of signatory State Parties are strong arguments against it. The Convention is nevertheless important as it is applicable _“outside territorial waters to all legally established submarine cables landed on the territories… of one or more of the High Contracting Parties”_ and hence sets a precedent for the exercise of jurisdiction. Article 2 of this Convention made the breaking or injury of a submarine cable, done wilfully or through culpable negligence that results in partial or total interruption in telegraphic communication, a punishable offence. While Article 8 of the Convention adheres to the principle of Flag State jurisdiction by providing competence to take cognizance of the offence, to the Flag State of the vessel aboard which the infraction took place, Article 10 empowers other High Contracting Parties to collect evidence for violations of this Convention and transmit them to the Flag State.

The attribution of jurisdiction was, however, slightly altered with the coming into force of the 1982 UNCLOS, due to the newly created/clarified maritime zones and the rights within these zones, which were afforded to coastal States. The coastal State has sovereignty in its Territorial Sea and is competent to enact rules and regulations to protect submarine cables within its Territorial Sea (Article 21(c) UNCLOS). The jurisdiction of the coastal State in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), however, is limited to the exercise of ‘sovereign rights’ with respect to the exploration and exploitation of resources. Therefore, the coastal State may restrict only such activities within its EEZ over which it has jurisdiction. This has been used effectively by Australia and New Zealand by creating ‘cable protection zones’ in which certain activities are restricted in an area declared as such with respect to identified submarine cable(s). Schedule 3 of the Telecommunications Act (Australia), _inter alia_, prohibits anchoring and the use of trawls and other fishing gear designed to work on the seabed, within these ‘cable protection zones’. This has been done to prevent bottom fishing or any such activity in these areas that may cause damage to a submarine cable. Similarly, Section 12 and Section 13 of the _“Submarine Cables and Pipelines Protection Act, 1996”_ of New Zealand, empower the Governor-General to declare an area — including within the EEZ — a ‘protected area’ within which fishing operations and anchoring of a ship is an offence. In this way, a common cause of damage to submarine communication cables has been sought to be addressed.

However, the issue of intentional human damage does not get addressed by this measure. UNCLOS, 1982, does provide for measures for the protection of submarine cables on the High Seas but affords jurisdiction to the Flag State of the vessel/nationals that effect the protection. Article 113 of the UNCLOS, in terms similar to those of the 1885 Convention, obligate the Flag State exercising jurisdiction over nationals/vessels to adopt laws and regulations necessary to provide that the breaking or injury of a submarine cable below the high seas, or any conduct calculated or likely to result in such breaking or injury, done wilfully or through culpable negligence, is a punishable offence if it obstructs telegraphic or telephonic communications. Article 58(2) UNCLOS extends this provision and makes it applicable within the EEZ as well.

This notwithstanding, there has been very poor compliance, with this provision, with the majority of States, including the Republic of India, not having enacted any comprehensive domestic legislation to this effect. Even a liberal reading of the 1988 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (SUA) would, at a minimum, require _“Flag State authorisation”_ and give preference to _“Flag State jurisdiction”_. It would appear that submarine cables fall into a legal gap and are left inadequately protected, particularly in the absence of vigorous measures to enact domestic legislation.

It is also not clear whether the State that owns the cables or the nationals of the State(s) which own or have laid the cables, can exercise jurisdiction (criminal or otherwise) over cables laid on the seabed under the high seas. It is quite doubtful, therefore, whether they would be able to enforce their own national laws over an incident damaging ‘their’ submarine cables in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ).

**Alternative Bases of Jurisdiction**

Solutions to this problem of the protection of submarine communications cables laid on the seabed under the high seas may, perhaps, be more readily found in alternative bases of attributing jurisdiction. Jurisdiction essentially concerns the extent of each State’s right to regulate the conduct or the consequences of events. Currently, under UNCLOS, the right to regulate an incident on the High Seas rests with the Flag State of the perpetrator. However, it is questionable whether this confers exclusive jurisdiction to the Flag State. Is no other State competent to exercise jurisdiction, especially when the Flag State has not exercised their jurisdiction by enacting laws and regulations to that effect? This is a vital question that needs to be squarely and urgently addressed.

The extra-territorial application of the laws of a State was addressed in the MV _Lotus_ case, which made clear the proposition that a State may exercise its jurisdiction only within its territory, i.e., ‘enforcement jurisdiction’, but there is nothing prohibiting a State from extending the application of its laws and jurisdiction of their courts to persons, property, and acts outside their territory, i.e., exercising its ‘prescriptive jurisdiction’. Therefore, a State may, if it so wishes, extend its laws to persons and acts outside its territory but may only enforce them within its territory. This principle has been refined to require a ‘linking point’ or connecting factor between the act to be legislated and the legislating State. These connecting factors are the recognised ‘bases of jurisdiction’ in international law.

The recognised bases of jurisdiction of particular interest to this scenario are the “passive personality”, the “protective principle”, and the “universality principle”.

**Passive Personality**

The principle of “passive personality” draws from the principle of nationality. It holds that sovereign States have a right to extend their laws over their nationals and have the prerogative to define the scope of ‘nationality’. States have, in the past, ascribed nationality to offshore oilrigs on the basis of the State of registry. Therefore, it is possible that submarine cables too could be brought under the scope of this principle and ‘nationality’ may also be ascribed on the basis of the nationality of ownership of the cables. Unfortunately, however, the ascertaining of nationality over private and consortium-based ownership is riddled with significant complexities. As explained earlier, it is difficult to ascertain the ownership of cables under consortium ownership. If the SEA-ME-WE 4 (Serial 6 of **Table 1** in Part 1 of this article refers) is cut in the Mediterranean Sea, but all that TCL owns is the cable and landing station in Indian territory, a nationality claim would probably not suffice for the exercise of prescriptive jurisdiction.","The article discusses underwater communication cables, specifically focusing on their vulnerabilities and the legal protections surrounding them.

By Trevor Hollingsbee - June 29, 2022  

A popular conception is that international communications nowadays rely mainly upon satellites. This, though, is very far from being the case.  
There are about 440 undersea cables stretching over a total of 885,000 kilometres. These cables carry some 95 per cent of the world’s communications traffic, and in some cases, even electrical power. This network continues to expand, and it is emerging as a likely priority target in future conflict, particularly as the cables often lie the vicinity of strategic maritime chokepoints such as the Greenland/UK gap.  

Threats and vulnerabilities  
Underwater cables are vulnerable to operations by hostile players, including non-state actors. Such forces intend either to monitor classified traffic or to sever the cables in order to disrupt communications or power supply. The extreme depths at which many underwater cables are located demand the deployment of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV).  

Russia’s special underwater missions ship Yantar has long been monitored while carrying out seabed operations in Middle Eastern waters and elsewhere. Yantar carries deep-diving manned submersibles as well as remotely operated underwater vehicles, both capable of operating on seabed infrastructure. The ship itself is also equipped with fixed and towed sonar systems for mapping the seabed.  

Other important assets in Russia’s seabed warfare inventory of nuclear-powered submarines include the huge Belgorod and the smaller specialised Losharik. The latter vessel is currently undergoing repairs following a major deadly fire in 2019.  

According to reports, some of which are disputed, the Russians cut submarine internet cables leading into Crimea prior to annexing the territory in 2014.  

The “Great Undersea Wall” of China  
China is increasingly dependent upon undersea cables to support its expanding and modernising economy. To mitigate the cables’ vulnerability, Beijing is planning to establish two protected shore facilities for incoming cables as well as docking stations for UUVs along its pipelines and two specialist “underwater cable ships”.  

Beijing is also pursuing a policy of introducing a “Great Undersea Wall”. This project, led by the China Shipbuilding Corporation, is intended to co-ordinate the operations of UUVs and seabed sensors to maintain underwater cables and to protect them against attack.  

China is also increasingly proactive against the underwater cable networks of rival nations. Intelligence reports state that three Chinese survey vessels are active in the South China Sea, and sometimes carry out operations aimed at regional underwater communications networks. These ships have been identified as Ong Fang Hong, Hai Yang Di Zhi Ba Hao, and Shi Yuan 1.  

Developments in the US and Britain  
A number of the “civilian” special mission ships of the US Navy’s Military Sealift Command, such as the Pathfinder-class, are engaged in seabed surveillance, particularly in the South China Sea.  

Furthermore, in order to safeguard its extensive underwater cable network, the US has activated its Forward Deployed Energy and Communications Outposts project. This is an array of fixed undersea docking stations that provides recharging, communications, and data transfer to extend UUV reach and endurance.  

A vital component of future US Navy seabed operations will be the Orca-class Extra Large Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (XLUUV), five of which have been ordered from Boeing. The 16-metre Orca has a top speed of eight knots and a range of about 12,000 kilometres. It features a modular design, which is adaptable for a range of underwater missions.  

Yantar was detected operating both off Ireland, and in the English Channel in 2021. The UK is particularly vulnerable to seabed warfare, as it depends upon an extensive network that includes both communications cables and interconnectors enabling the transfer of electrical power between UK and continental Europe.  

The UK Royal Navy’s ocean survey vessel Scott reportedly has some seabed warfare capability, and the RN is developing an XLUUV for such operations, with an experimental Manta XLUUV built by M-Subs currently undergoing trials.  

A further project is the development of a specialised surface vessel, a Multi-Role Offshore Survey Ship (MROSS). It is unclear at present whether the MROSS requirement will be met by a dedicated naval or auxiliary vessel, or by a contracted civilian vessel.","The article provides a thorough discussion on undersea cables, highlighting their critical role in global communications.

Is Moscow interested in cutting or tapping the cables? Does it want the West to worry it might? Is there a more innocent explanation? Unsurprisingly, Russia isn’t saying.

But whatever Moscow’s intentions, U.S. and Western officials are increasingly troubled by their rival’s interest in the 400 fiber-optic cables that carry most of world’s calls, emails and texts, as well as $10 trillion worth of daily financial transactions.

“We’ve seen activity in the Russian navy, and particularly undersea in their submarine activity, that we haven’t seen since the ‘80s,” Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of the U.S. European Command, told Congress this month.

Without undersea cables, a bank in Asian countries couldn’t send money to Saudi Arabia to pay for oil. U.S. military leaders would struggle to communicate with troops fighting extremists in Afghanistan and the Middle East. A student in Europe wouldn’t be able to Skype his parents in the United States.

All this information is transmitted along tiny glass fibers encased in undersea cables that, in some cases, are little bigger than a garden hose. All told, there are 620,000 miles of fiber-optic cable running under the sea, enough to loop around the earth nearly 25 times.

Most lines are owned by private telecommunications companies, including giants like Google and Microsoft. Their locations are easily identified on public maps, with swirling lines that look like spaghetti. While cutting one cable might have limited impact, severing several simultaneously or at choke points could cause a major outage.

The Russians “are doing their homework and, in the event of a crisis or conflict with them, they might do rotten things to us,” said Michael Kofman, a Russian military expert at nonprofit research group CNA Corp.

It’s not Moscow’s warfighting ships and submarines that are making NATO and U.S. officials uneasy. It’s Russia’s Main Directorate of Deep Sea Research, whose specialized surface ships, submarines, underwater drones and mini subs conduct reconnaissance, underwater salvage and other work.

One ship run by the directorate is the Yantar. It’s a modest, 354-foot oceanographic vessel that holds a crew of about 60. It most recently was off South America’s coast helping Argentina search for a lost submarine.

Parlamentskaya Gazeta, the Russian parliament’s publication, last October said the Yantar has equipment “designed for deep-sea tracking” and “connecting to top-secret communication cables.” The publication said that in September 2015, the Yantar was near Kings Bay, Georgia, home to a U.S. submarine base, “collecting information about the equipment on American submarines, including underwater sensors and the unified (U.S. military) information network.” Rossiya, a Russian state TV network, has said the Yantar can not only connect to top-secret cables, but could cut them and “jam underwater sensors with a special system.”

Russia’s Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

There is no hard evidence that the ship is engaged in nefarious activity, said Steffan Watkins, an information technology security consultant in Canada tracking the ship. But he wonders what the ship is doing when it’s stopped over critical cables or when its Automatic Identification System tracking transponder isn’t on.

Of the Yantar’s crew, he said: “I don’t think these are the actual guys who are doing any sabotage. I think they’re laying the groundwork for future operations.”

Members of Congress are wondering, too.

Rep. Joe Courtney, a Connecticut Democrat on a House subcommittee on sea power, said of the Russians, “The mere fact that they are clearly tracking the cables and prowling around the cables shows that they are doing something.”

Democratic Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, an Armed Services Committee member, said Moscow’s goal appears to be to “disrupt the normal channels of communication and create an environment of misinformation and distrust.”

The Yantar’s movements have previously raised eyebrows.

On Oct. 18, 2016, a Syrian telecom company ordered emergency maintenance to repair a cable in the Mediterranean that provides internet connectivity to several countries, including Syria, Libya and Lebanon. The Yantar arrived in the area the day before the four-day maintenance began. It left two days before the maintenance ended. It’s unknown what work it did while there.

Watkins described another episode on Nov. 5, 2016, when a submarine cable linking Persian Gulf nations experienced outages in Iran. Hours later, the Yantar left Oman and headed to an area about 60 miles west of the Iranian port city of Bushehr, where the cable runs ashore. Connectivity was restored just hours before the Yantar arrived on Nov. 9. The boat stayed stationary over the site for several more days.

Undersea cables have been targets before.

At the beginning of World War I, Britain cut a handful of German underwater communications cables and tapped the rerouted traffic for intelligence. In the Cold War, the U.S. Navy sent American divers deep into the Sea of Okhotsk off the Russian coast to install a device to record Soviet communications, hoping to learn more about the USSR’s submarine-launched nuclear capability.

More recently, British and American intelligence agencies have eavesdropped on fiber optic cables, according to documents released by Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor.

In 2007, Vietnamese authorities confiscated ships carrying miles of fiber optic cable that thieves salvaged from the sea for profit. The heist disrupted service for several months. And in 2013, Egyptian officials arrested three scuba divers off Alexandria for attempting to cut a cable stretching from France to Singapore. Five years on, questions remain about the attack on a cable responsible for about a third of all internet traffic between Egypt and Europe.

Despite the relatively few publicly known incidents of sabotage, most outages are due to accidents.

Two hundred or so cable-related outages take place each year. Most occur when ship anchors snap cables or commercial fishing equipment snags the lines. Others break during tsunamis, earthquakes and other natural disasters.

But even accidental cuts can harm U.S. military operations.

In 2008 in Iraq, unmanned U.S. surveillance flights nearly screeched to a halt one day at Balad Air Base not because of enemy mortar attacks or dusty winds. An anchor had snagged a cable hundreds of miles away from the base, situated in the “Sunni Triangle” northwest of Baghdad.

The severed cable had linked controllers based in the United States with unmanned aircraft flying intelligence, surveillance and recognizance missions for coalition forces in the skies over Iraq, explained Ret. Air Force Col. Dave Lujan of Hampton, Virginia.

“Say you’re operating a remote-controlled car and all of a sudden you can’t control it,” said Lujan, who was deputy commander of the 332nd Expeditionary Operations Group at the base when the little-publicized outage lasted for two to three days. “That’s a big impact,” he said, describing how U.S. pilots had to fly the missions instead.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, highlighting potential threats from Russian military activities, the implications of cutting these cables on global communications, and historical instances of sabotage.

Breaks in the high capacity fibre optic data cables that link countries around the world together and on the internet, many of which sit on the seabed, are not uncommon. Now a new report has warned that other countries and terrorists could potentially cripple the UK by attacking those.

The threat is by no means new, although today most cable breaks occur due to accidents by deep sea fishing trawlers, ships dragging their anchor over them or marine life deciding to take a nibble (smaller cables have been broken by hungry sharks in the past but modern cables tend to be more resistant). A whole industry exists to repair such cables and it usually takes a few weeks to fix a break, although this does depend upon the type of break, sea depth, weather conditions and various other factors etc.

Now a new paper from the [Policy Exchange](https://policyexchange.org.uk), which was authored by Conservative MP Rishi Sunak (Richmond), has woken up to what has been obvious for years by warning that when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine, one of its first moves was to cut the main cable connection to the outside world. Similarly in 2007 an Al-Qaeda plot to destroy a key London internet exchange was foiled.

The report claims that US intelligence officials have similarly highlighted how Russian submarines have been seen “_aggressively operating_” near Atlantic cables as part of their “_broader interest in unconventional methods of warfare_” (potential threats from Iran and China are also highlighted). In addition, undersea cables come ashore in just a few remote (coastal) locations, which tend to be both public knowledge and softly protected (note: some military cables are not public knowledge).

> **Rishi Sunak MP said:**
> “A successful attack on the UK’s undersea cable infrastructure would be an existential threat to our security. Yet the exact locations of these cables are both isolated and publicly available – jugulars of the world economy which are a singularly attractive target for our enemies.
> 
> Since the first trans-Atlantic cable was laid in 1858, undersea cables have generally been owned and installed by private companies. Although this is good for taxpayers, it also means that most governments have not given undersea cables enough attention.
> 
> As we debate our future defence priorities, protecting the freedom of the seas and all the lanes of communication on and under them is paramount. Britain and our NATO allies must ensure that our maritime capabilities get the investment they need.”

However it’s worth noting that cutting lots of transatlantic fibre optic cables, while a risk, is something that would be very difficult to completely prevent and the same sort of attack could just as easily be used against an aggressor.

The fact that so much international trade is carried over the internet also means that other countries are likely to be harmed by such an activity, which may include the attacking state (i.e. directly or indirectly).

Overall 97% of global communications and $10 trillion (£7.44tr at today’s exchange rate) in daily financial transactions are transmitted by cables resting deep beneath the ocean.

A cursory glance at Parliamentary records (Hansard) does not reveal any recent discussion of undersea cables at all.
> 
> **3. Secure Landing Sites**
> Given the high level of strategic importance attributed to particular UK landing sites by the US State Department and the potentially catastrophic consequences of a security breach, more must be done to enhance security at major UK landing sites. The government should instruct the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) to carry out a full review of how landing sites are protected. Consideration should be given to requiring a level of protection more in line with other critical infrastructure such as national power generating capacity.
> 
> **4. Establish Cable Protection Zones**
> Britain should establish Australian-style Cable Protection Zones (CPZs) around its coast in areas with high-value communication corridors. These CPZs ban certain types of anchoring and fishing, require greater disclosure by any vessels inside them, enjoy enhanced Coast Guard monitoring and carry significant penalties for breaches of rules. Working with international partners, Britain should also seek to encourage the establishment of CPZs in the Mediterranean and Suez, in order to safeguard connectivity in strategically important theatres such as the Middle East.
> 
> **5. Deploy Better Monitoring Equipment on Cables**
> Most attacks on underwater cables would likely require underwater vehicles. As it is very dark at the depths that cables are laid, these vehicles use high-frequency sonar to help them navigate. Cable laying companies could be “required to place relatively cheap sensors that detect sonar frequencies near key undersea infrastructure and along cable routes. If the sensors were tripped, they could alert nearby coast guard or navy assets.
> 
> **6. Broaden Geographic Diversity**
> Whether at key international choke points like the Luzon Strait, or in the concentration of trans-continental cables in a small number of costal landing sites, the lack of geographic diversity in the world’s undersea cable network greatly increases its vulnerability to disruption. Britain should use its influence as a key geographic bridge between the US and Europe to work with the private sector and overseas governments to promote the greater geographic diversity of undersea cables. By increasing the number of landing sites and, where possible, avoiding overreliance on at-sea choke points the resilience of the world’s telecommunications network would be significantly enhanced.
> 
> **7. Increase the Supply of “Dark Cables”**
> Using tax incentives and working with private telecommunications companies, the government could also encourage building backup cable systems and redundant systems. This builds resiliency into the whole system from a national perspective, something individual private businesses have no incentive to do alone.
> 
> **8. Strengthen International Law Protecting Cables**
> The present piecemeal legal regime is deficient in ensuring the security of cables and such vital infrastructure requires a more comprehensive approach. The UK should push for the adoption of a “_new international treaty that protects submarine cables, making international interference with them an international crime, and include provisions for mutual cooperation on enforcement against such crimes_.”
> 
> **9. Increase NATO Naval Exercises and Review Maritime Capabilities**
> Undersea cables are the very definition of international infrastructure and an international response is needed if they are to be successfully safeguarded against military threats. The UK should press at the NATO level to promote the undertaking of naval exercises and war games to hone potential responses to an attack on undersea cable infrastructure. These exercises would work with the submarine cable industry to test protocols and defence strategies in an international setting. Furthermore, it may be necessary to increase NATO maritime capabilities to protect freedom of the seas and our sea lanes of communication.

"Protecting Undersea Cables to Safeguard Internet Connectivity","Highlights the urgent need for enhanced protection of undersea cables, crucial for global communications, amid rising geopolitical threats.","https://policyexchange.org.uk/press-release/indispensable-but-insecure-why-protecting-undersea-cables-will-save-the-internet","2017-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","Policy Exchange",Yes,"Rishi Sunak MP","London, England",-,"2017-12-04","English","Policy Exchange","We must do more to protect the indispensable yet insecure internet infrastructure provided by undersea cables, urges Rishi Sunak MP in _Undersea Cables: Indispensable, Insecure_ published by Policy Exchange today.

97% of global communications and $10 trillion in daily financial transactions are transmitted, not by satellites in the skies, but by cables lying deep beneath the ocean. Undersea cables are the indispensable infrastructure of our time, essential to our modern life and digital economy, yet they are inadequately protected and highly vulnerable to attack at sea and on land, from both hostile states and terrorists.

US intelligence officials have spoken of Russian submarines “aggressively operating” near Atlantic cables as part of its broader interest in unconventional methods of warfare. When Russia annexed Crimea, one of its first moves was to sever the main cable connection to the outside world.

Undersea cables come ashore in just a few remote, coastal locations. These landing sites are critical national infrastructure but often have minimal protection, making them vulnerable to terrorism. A foiled Al-Qaeda plot to destroy a key London internet exchange in 2007 illustrates the credibility of the threat.

Since the first trans-Atlantic cable laid in 1858, cables have mainly been installed and owned by private companies. Although positive for taxpayers, this has meant undersea cables do not get the attention from governments they deserve.

The report recommends that:

*   The next Strategic Defence and Security Review should specifically address threats to Britain’s security from attacks on our undersea cable infrastructure
*   The Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure should quickly review and improve security at UK landing sites where cables come ashore
*   Britain and NATO must ensure their maritime resources are adequate to deal with this new threat to our security
*   The government should work with private communications companies to install more backup ‘dark cables’ and improve monitoring at sea
*   We should follow the example of Australia and New Zealand and establish Cable Protection Zones around our highest value communications corridors
*   The UK must lead efforts to develop a new international treaty to protect undersea cables

This report has been endorsed by Admiral James Stavridis, US Navy (Ret), former NATO Supreme Allied Commander; Robert Hannigan, former Security Adviser to the Prime Minister and Director of GCHQ until earlier this year; and General Lord Houghton, former UK Chief of Defence Staff, who stepped down in 2016.

In his Foreword to the report, Admiral Stavridis says

“It is not satellites in the sky, but pipes on the ocean floor that form the backbone or the world’s economy. We have allowed this vital infrastructure to grow increasingly vulnerable and this should worry us all.

“Over my own career, I have seen the Atlantic transition from being a theater characterized by near complete NATO supremacy to a space that Russia is actively contesting through a resurgent naval doctrine. If the relative weakness of the Russian position makes a conventional conflict with NATO unlikely, it also raises the appeal for them of asymmetric targets like fibre optic cables. We should prepare for increased maritime hybrid activity, not just from Russia, but also from China and Iran.”

Rishi Sunak MP, the author of the report, says:

“A successful attack on the UK’s undersea cable infrastructure would be an existential threat to our security. Yet the exact locations of these cables are both isolated and publicly available – jugulars of the world economy which are a singularly attractive target for our enemies.

“Since the first transatlantic cable was laid in 1858, undersea cables have generally been owned and installed by private companies. Although this is good for taxpayers, it also means that most governments have not given undersea cables enough attention.

“As we debate our future defence priorities, protecting the freedom of the seas and all the lanes of communication on and under them is paramount. Britain and our NATO allies must ensure that our maritime capabilities get the investment they need.","The article discusses the critical role of undersea cables in global communications and highlights their vulnerabilities, including the risks of them being cut or attacked.

It provides specific examples, such as the Russian annexation of Crimea, and emphasizes the need for better protection of this infrastructure.

Therefore, it satisfies the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables."
"Sea Cables in a Thawing Arctic","Explores geopolitical risks with sea cables, including a Russian incident cutting a cable, impacting global telecommunications.","https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/sea-cables-thawing-arctic","2021-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","Elizabeth Buchanan",Yes,"Elizabeth Buchanan",-,"5921","2021-09-20","English","Lowy Institute","**Sea cables in a thawing Arctic**  
  
China has made a significant foray into the Arctic with the creation of a data “silk road”. Strongly supported by a newfound closeness with Russia, preliminary planning of a Chinese and Finnish–led trans-Arctic cable along the Arctic’s Northeast Passage in partnership with Japan and Norway is underway. But the project, essentially a relaunch of a stagnated Russian initiative, presents stark risks in affording Moscow and Beijing potential influence over global telecommunications.
  
**Sea cables 101**  
Contrary to popular belief, satellites carry very little global data. Sea cables have been an important method of global communication since the mid-19th century. The advent of fibre optics in the 1990s made modern sea cabling even more critical. This vast network, comprising some one million kilometres in total, carries almost all data transfers and, according to a recent report, facilitates finance transfers of more than $10 trillion dollars every day.
  
Beyond the significance to the global financial market, sea cables transfer nearly all our global telecommunications data. These cables are a matter of crucial national security.
  
Historically, sea cables have only been vulnerable to damage from threats related to fisheries, anchors, earthquakes, and tsunamis. Being relatively void of these challenges, at least for now, the Arctic offers a unique environment for sea cables. But the increasingly assertive foreign policy agendas of some states means that these cables are at risk of purposeful interference, as per the emerging “hybrid” security threat.
  
Russia has already demonstrated interest and ability in exploiting sea cable vulnerabilities. In 2013, little green men cut the sea cable between Crimea and Ukraine – a crucial step in controlling the internet within the annexed territory.
  
**Advantages of an Arctic route**  
The thawing Arctic presents an attractive sea cable route. A trans-Arctic sea cable cuts the distance between Asia and Europe by roughly 40%. The shorter the physical cable distance, the lower the latency (total round-trip data transmission time). Melting ice and developments in technology have prompted a range of feasibility studies into the viability of a trans-Arctic sea cable route. Arctic Council permanent members Canada, Russia, the US, Norway, and Denmark have all, to varying degrees, undertaken assessments of potential Arctic data highways.
  
To date, two Arctic routes have been touted, yet only one has made it to the development stage. The first route treks along the Northwest Passage, along Canada’s Arctic coastline. This cable links data from London to Tokyo and is well into development. Dubbed “Arctic Fibre”, and consisting of approximately 16,000 kilometres of cable, this route was originally a Canadian venture. In 2016 Arctic Fibre was acquired by Alaska-based firm Quintillion.
  
Despite slow progress since, in late 2017 the first phase of the network was completed. The 1900-kilometre phase along the Alaskan coast is to be followed by the Asia-Pacific segment. From there, Arctic Fibre’s final phase will be the Canada–United Kingdom link.
  
The second route follows the Northern Sea Route along the Northeast Passage, hugging Russia’s coastline. Named ROTACS (Russian Optical Trans-Arctic Cable System), the route links London to Tokyo via branches in Russia and Beijing. It is approximately this route that Finland and China have revived and rebranded to meet the expected rise in Europe–Asia data transfer needs.
  
This recent revival of the ROTACS concept is driven in part by Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The Arctic component of BRI has been pounced on by Russia and Finland, with the former’s interest clearly the realisation of the shelved ROTACS route. As Chair of the Arctic Council, Finland has a key interest in achieving the “connectivity” component of its broader “exploring common solutions” chairmanship theme. Finland’s feasibility study into what it calls an “Arctic Connect” cable concluded that a second trans-Arctic cable would be a “win-win-win” for Europe, Russia, and Asia. Strong European support for cooperation with Russia in advancing the global technological commons appears to be enough incentive to seek a reset of sorts with the Kremlin.
  
**The cable’s challenges**  
The majority of sea cables are not state-owned or operated, but instead controlled by private telecommunications firms. There is, therefore, a grey area when it comes to enforcing security of the system.
  
If a cable is not registered to a nation in its entirety, how can it be sufficiently defended from threats such as hacking, tapping, or even sabotage? In 1982 the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea attempted to allocate legal protection to sea cables. Of course, nations yet to ratify the agreement, including the US, are not bound by such provisions. The best practice for deterring interference, and ultimately protecting the nexus of global sea cables, has proved to be somewhat elusive. Australia is leading the way with the development of Cable Protection Zones (CPZs), but establishing and monitoring wider CPZs in the global high seas would be a far harder task.
  
Russia’s new Yantar-class submarine has specific capabilities to disrupt cable signals. In 2017 a tabletop exercise was conducted by the Center for a New American Security on sea cable security. This wargame of sorts simulated a Russian attack on NATO sea lines of communication, specifically sea cables off the coast of Iceland. Participants struggled to determine whose responsibility is was to restore the cables – the grey zone between state and private ownership of sea cables was a significant hurdle for policy-makers.
  
At present, the trans-Arctic cable involves a consortium of state-owned firms. This points to a further potential challenge: the security of data transmission. Finland’s state-owned Cinia Group Oy and China’s state-owned China Telecom are central backers of a trans-Arctic sea cable. Investigating Russian stakeholders in a trans-Arctic cable is where things get a little murky, primarily because this cable route is not new at all. Links to the Kremlin are evident.
  
Beyond the obvious benefits for Russia, a trans-Arctic sea cable also affords the Kremlin a significant opportunity to demonstrate its role in the development of the Arctic commons. Russia might yet diversify its Arctic economy to take advantage of its vast geographical endowment and strengthen its foothold in the region’s technological, shipping, and transport future. Developing the trans-Arctic sea cable is a legitimate strategic interest for the Kremlin. It is evident that Western sanctions may have driven Russia into Beijing’s arms in seeking finance, even if the Russia–China Arctic link is fraught with mutual suspicion.
  
Should this newest incarnation of a trans-Arctic sea cable gain traction and reach the development stage, it could offer grounds for an opportunistic outlook for the region. However, due diligence must be paid to data security and the legalities of ownership and operation of sea cables before the route comes online.","The article ""Sea cables in a thawing Arctic"" discusses the geopolitical implications of sea cables, including a direct reference to an incident where Russian forces cut a sea cable between Crimea and Ukraine.

It elaborates on the vulnerabilities of sea cables to various threats, including purposeful interference by state actors.

Furthermore, it stresses the importance of these cables for global telecommunications and the potential risks to internet connectivity.

Defendants say Virgin Media failed to ensure that its cables were protected in a long-established fishing ground.  
The owners of a fishing trawler which allegedly damaged an undersea fibre optics cable providing internet and telephone connection between Ireland and Britain are being sued in the High Court over the €800,000 cost of repairs.  
Virgin Media Wholesale Ltd is suing “the owners and all persons claiming an interest” in the MV The Lida Suzanna trawler over the alleged incident on January 26, 2015, involving damage to the subsea cable stretching 219km between Dublin and Lytham St Anne’s near Blackpool in England.  
The vessel was allegedly involved in scallop fishing which involves dredging the seabed.  
Virgin, which has registered offices in Hampshire in the UK, is seeking damages and a declaration that a maritime lien, or claim, attaches to the Irish-registered vessel which is based in Wexford. It also seeks an order for its sale if necessary.  
The defendants deny the vessel was responsible for causing damage to the cable and require proof of this. It is also contended that Virgin is the author of its own misfortune by not taking sufficient measures to bury or protect its cables.  
Alternatively, it claims Virgin was contributorily negligent. There was also an alleged failure to protect its cables in an “area of fishing ground established centuries past”.  
The defendants say they were doing nothing more than the lawful exploitation of fishing rights and Virgin has no entitlement to expect or demand that fishing be modified, or stopped by reason of the laying of its cable.  
The court heard the cable was installed in 1998 by Virgin’s predecessor NTL. It is one of two cables, the Sirius South and the Sirius North, running between Ireland and Britain and if one is damaged, Virgin can switch to the other. There have been some 18 instances of damage involving trawlers since it was installed.  
Repairs were carried out over the following days by the repair ship, the Pierre de Fermat.  
Opening the case on behalf of Virgin yesterday, Edward Farrelly SC said it was their case that the defendants should have been or ought to have been aware of the location of the cable which is marked on industry-recognised charts and Ireland’s Marine Atlas.  
Merchant shipping regulations place a statutory duty on the vessel to carry publications which would have alerted it to the location of the cable, counsel said. It is further alleged there was a failure to ensure the skipper and/or crew were adequately aware of and/or educated about the location of subsea cables.  
The case continues before Mr Justice Denis McDonald.","The article discusses a legal case regarding damage to an undersea fiber optics cable, with direct mentions of 'subsea cable' and implications for internet connectivity.

The quake affected an area of the sea bottom with a lot of undersea cables that broke, and since there is only a limited number of cable repair ships, it will take at least weeks to fish them up and splice them.

China and Korea were heavily affected, with most of their connectivity to the rest of the world cut off. Not surprisingly, this meant that the rest of the world got a lot less spam, too. Neither country is the haven for overt spammers that it used to be, but both have large broadband networks with vast numbers of virus controlled zombie computers. One large network in North America saw their mail from Korea drop by 90% and from China by 99%. Since the mail sent from those countries to the US is typically 99% spam and 1% legitimate mail, the earthquake’s effect on e-mail was, to a first approximation, to get rid of a lot of spam. Brett Glass, a journalist who runs a small rural ISP in Wyoming, noted that if the affected countries dealt more effectively with their spam, they might not well have needed all of the capacity they’d lost.

At a time when more than 95% of everything that moves on the global Internet passes through just 200 undersea fiber-optic cables, potential adversaries such as the US, Russia, China and Iran are focusing on these deep-sea information pipes as rich sources of intelligence as well as targets in war.

The weapons earmarked for the struggle include submarines, underwater drones, robots and specialized ships and divers. The new battlefield is also a gray legal zone: Current Law of the Sea conventions cover some aspects of undersea cables but not hostile acts.

There’s evidence that missions are already under way and that most big powers, including the US, are keen on engaging in such activities. Cables can also be attacked by terrorists and other non-state actors.

The damage from such hard-to-detect acts could be enormous, since a foe’s economy, in addition to military and diplomatic communications, could be blinded. As more nations exploit the Internet for political or military gain, it’s also clear that the tactical concept of undersea cables as critical assets to be attacked or defended is an idea whose time has come.

“In the most severe scenario of an all-out attack upon undersea cable infrastructure by a hostile actor the impact of connectivity loss is potentially catastrophic, but even relatively limited sabotage has the potential to cause significant economic disruption and damage,” a former commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, retired US Navy Admiral James Stavridis, wrote in the foreword to a recent report, “Undersea Cables: Indispensable, Insecure.”

It’s hard to overstate the importance and vulnerability of the world’s undersea cables. Rishi Sunak, the Conservative British member of Parliament who authored the December report, noted that the world’s undersea Internet cables carried about US$10 trillion of financial transactions in a single day as well as huge volumes of data, from e-mails to classified government-to-government information.

“Were the network to disappear, the entire capacity of the Earth’s satellite network could handle just 7% of the communications currently sent via cable from the United States alone,” Sunak wrote.

**Asian chokepoints**

Chokepoints where cables converge because of underwater terrain or other factors are especially vulnerable. One is the Luzon Strait near the Philippines, where all the undersea cables connecting Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan pass. The site’s vulnerability was underscored on December 26, 2006, when an undersea landslide severed six cables, temporarily disrupting Internet traffic throughout the region.

In the US, the bulk of trans-Atlantic Internet bandwidth comes ashore at a few sites within a 50-kilometer radius of New York City.

The contours of the new battlefield are enormous: Submarine cables can hug the ocean bottom only a few meters from the surface or straddle abysses as deep as Mount Everest is tall.

The locations of the world’s cables are also well mapped and available online, making them prey for specialized subs, ships, divers or something as simple as grappling hooks.

“Protection of the undersea cables that are an essential – and vulnerable – part of the global economy is yet another potential responsibility for a US Navy that is dangerously overstretched,” Joseph Callo, a naval authority and retired rear admiral in the US Navy Reserve, told Asia Times.

US intelligence officials contend that Russia is the chief offender in the new cable war. They have publicly disclosed that Russian submarines are “aggressively operating” near the Atlantic cables that serve the US mainland, as part of an asymmetric-warfare approach.

**US has spy submarine**

However, there are signs that the United States may be engaging in similar activities. In September, the US media reported that the USS Jimmy Carter, a Seawolf-class nuclear submarine equipped for intelligence missions, had returned to its base in Washington state flying a Jolly Roger pirate flag beside the US flag.

Hoisting the skull and crossbones in the US submarine service signals the successful completion of a mission. What was the Jimmy Carter up to? The US Navy didn’t say. But some analysts speculated that the sub, which carries remotely operated vehicles and SEAL (Sea, Air and Land) teams, might have been placing or removing taps on undersea cables.

Covert Shores, a specialist website dedicated to analysis of maritime special forces and submarines, alleged in an updated article that the Russian Navy had been operating an advanced spy ship called the Yantar that is suspected of tapping into undersea Internet cables and carrying out other intelligence work on the sea floor.

Yantar “can host two deep submergence submarines for undersea engineering missions,” wrote H I Sutton, the author of the Covert Shores article. “These missions are thought to include cable cutting, laying of taps on undersea cables, removing other countries’ taps (‘delousing’) and related intelligence missions. She may also perform other special missions such as recovery of sensitive equipment from crashed aircraft or test missiles.”

The military website says the Yantar has been observed loitering off the US coast, Cuba, Turkey, Northern Cyprus and other sites where there are key undersea cable connections.

Rob Huebert, a senior fellow at the University of Calgary’s Center for Military and Strategic Studies, points to reports that the Russians have a special mini-submarine launched in 2003 that dives to a very deep range. He says the sub, variously called the Losharik or Project 201 and AS-12, is suspected of being able to carry out cable missions, though this is unconfirmed.

“If the Russians have this, it would be highly likely that both the Chinese and Americans have the same ability,” Huebert told Asia Times.

**Is China involved?**

Actual evidence of Chinese or Iranian participation in cable-focused espionage activities is spotty. The US side points to Chinese activities in the South China Sea and Iranian actions in the Persian Gulf where civilian vessels rather than easily observed military ships with “gray hulls” are being used to carry out unknown activities.

Stavridis noted in his foreword that underwater cables are easy targets for unmarked civilian vessels that can do their work with conventional, non-military technology.

There’s a propaganda spin to such US allegations. But both Beijing and Tehran can be expected to engage in such activities if they see potential foes such as the US developing this capability.

Stavridis says a solution for the US side is to create “dark cables” that aren’t operational but can be kept in reserve for emergencies. He says another option is to engage Russia and others in bolstering international legal protections for undersea cables and other fiber-optic grids.

**Past incidents**

Mysterious disruptions of submarine cables have been reported for years. A flurry of incidents occurred in 2008. Five high-speed Internet cables serving the Middle East and India were hit, resulting in major Internet slowdowns. Speculation was that some damage was caused by a dragging ship anchor near Alexandria, Egypt – though officials said there were no surface vessels in the vicinity at the time.

The Egyptian government also arrested three scuba divers near Alexandria in March 2013 after they were allegedly caught cutting an undersea cable serving the Mediterranean region, causing a noticeable Internet slowdown. The divers claimed they cut the cable by accident. But Egyptian officials never explained what motivated the trio.

The incidents stirred a host of conspiracy theories, including allegations that the US National Security Agency was tapping Internet traffic or that local governments were deliberately slowing online access for protesters using smartphones.

**Foreword**  
_Air Chief Marshal Lord Peach GBE KCB DL_  
_Former Chief of the Defence Staff and former Chairman, NATO Military Committee_  

Undersea fibre-optic cables are the unseen arteries of global communication. Their significance extends far beyond digital connectivity, underpinning the resilience of our economic systems, the efficacy of our defensive frameworks, and the cohesion of our modern societies. Unsurprisingly, they have now become a critical asset – and valuable target – in an era of rising geopolitical tensions.  

When then backbencher Rishi Sunak wrote about the insecurity of the UK’s undersea cables in his 2017 Policy Exchange report, and I spoke on the same issue in my RUSI Annual Chief of the Defence Staff Lecture that year, this national security risk was scarcely mentioned. Seven years later, however, regular sightings of suspicious Russian activity in nearby waters, mysterious cable-cutting incidents, and the growing concern amongst our allies about undersea infrastructure vulnerabilities, all signal that we have arrived in a new era of undersea warfare.  

This new threat landscape demands an urgent assessment of the UK’s undersea defences, and the further measures needed to bolster their resilience. Policy Exchange’s new report offers just that, comprising a timely update on the state of our national undersea cable security, and proposing a new ‘space to seabed’ strategic doctrine for protecting our critical subsea infrastructure.  

As the report shows, British interests depend on the stability of undersea cable networks the world over. As we are connected to our close Allies by our geography, our history and prosperity it is time – with our Allies – to act.  

Moscow has already begun probing Atlantic undersea infrastructure as the weak underbelly of our national security. Targeting critical infrastructure to distract and degrade its enemies is far from an unexpected strategy, but is an essential pillar of Russia’s military doctrine.  

Further east, China is fortifying its undersea defences as part of its wider aspiration to become a great military power. Beijing’s ‘Undersea Great Wall’ defensive system, and its attempts to finance and establish its own regional cable networks independent of the West, risk fracturing global digital communications in unprecedented and disruptive ways.  

In the Middle Eastern littoral waters act as the bottleneck of the major Europe-Africa-Asia cable highway. The proximity of the narrow and shallow waters to Iranian shores lays bare the extreme vulnerability of cables passing through this volatile region.  

Policy Exchange’s new report makes targeted policy recommendations – ranging across the tactical, technical, operational and strategic domains – aimed at equipping the UK to protect its assets below the water’s surface.  

**Executive Summary**  
**Technological and operational developments have brought geopolitical competition to the seabed.** As the ability to manoeuvre, map and operate at greater depths increases, critical maritime infrastructure along the seabed resembles the exposed underbelly of national security in a new age of undersea warfare.  

**Undersea fibre-optic cables constitute the most vulnerable component of this infrastructure system.** 99% of the UK’s digital communications with the outside world depend on this cable network. Our social, economic, political and military systems are therefore entirely reliant upon our ability to police and protect the cables which run in and beyond our territorial waters.  

**Heavy congestion in digital and energy interconnector cable supply chains means that rapidly accelerating demand is set to outpace supply throughout the 2030s.** As the global green transition necessitates new subsea infrastructure, cable manufacturing capacity is now over-stretched. Without rapid expansion of cable-making facilities, existing networks are set to come under increasing strain – and with that, their protection becomes all the more essential.  

**Protection of our undersea cable network poses a unique strategic challenge.** The current tactical, operational and technological landscape affords outsized advantages to the aggressor over the defender.  

**Seabed warfare is no longer a futuristic scenario, but a contemporary form of conflict in the era of increasing geopolitical competition.** As a belligerent Russia, and disruptive China and Iran, develop the capabilities to conduct subthreshold undersea warfare, the UK and its allies must not be caught flat-footed, and unable to deter and disrupt aggression against our critical maritime infrastructure along the seabed.  

**Since 2021, there have been eight unattributed yet suspicious cable-cutting incidents in the Euro-Atlantic.** The frequency of incidents and sightings involving critical maritime infrastructure is increasing.  

**Chinese undersea offensive and defensive capabilities are fast improving, posing growing risks to cable networks in the Indo-Pacific.** The PRC is rapidly building its undersea arsenal of attack and defence capabilities, which is certain to play a significant role in future contestation in the region.","The article 'From space to seabed' discusses the strategic importance of undersea cables, directly mentioning 'cable-cutting incidents' and emphasizing the implications of these incidents on national security and global communication.

It highlights specific events, including suspicious activities related to undersea cables, and frames the discussion within the context of geopolitical tensions, making it a central theme of the report.

The article meets the criterion for being on the topic of cut sea cables."

JUNEAU -- Telecommunications services in Southeast Alaska were snarled Friday after a 5.9-magnitude earthquake apparently cut a crucial seabed data cable.  
""The earthquake damaged our submarine fiber-optic cable and so we're working on repairing it right now,"" said Hannah Blankenship, spokesperson for Alaska Communications Systems Group.  
But ACS was unable to provide much additional information about how widespread the outages were or how many customers were affected. ACS provides both wireless and Internet service.  
The severed cable was the company's primary link to Juneau, connecting offshore to the company's main fiber-optic line between Alaska and the Lower 48, she said.  
Blankenship said she did not know how many customers were affected but expected it was the majority of its Southeast customers. She declined to say how many customers ACS has in Southeast.  
It was not clear late Friday when service would be restored.  
""We will work with a vendor to dispatch a ship to the area and use equipment to retrieve (the cable) and bring it up to the surface,"" she said. Blankenship could provide no estimates for when that might begin.  
""It will take time to mobilize -- it will depend,"" she said. ""When we have a ship dispatched or going out there, we will give an update.""  
Other companies also use ACS' network and their customers were affected as well but Blankenship declined to say who they were or how widespread the outage was.  
Alaska Power & Telephone, which provides phone service to small Southeast communities from Haines to Prince of Wales Island, told Juneau's KTOO radio that it is one of those companies.  
""All of the raw transport in our network is totally fine but we interconnect with and buy transport from ACS in Juneau and that's where the problem lies, outside of Juneau somewhere,"" Mike McGrath, the company's executive vice president, told the station.  
Johnny Rice, a resident of Craig on Prince of Wales Island, said he's one of those customers, and the loss of Internet service is having an impact all over the island.  
It's been especially hard on businesses that need to use the Internet to process credit and debit transactions, and some had to close Friday.  
""There are vendors here who are out of business, they've shut the doors and sent everybody home because their point-of-sale system is down,"" he said.  
A local grocery store was able to use a dial-up card reader but the process was slow and was delaying transactions.","The article titled ""5.9 earthquake causes telecom outage in Southeast Alaska"" directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables.

It reports that a 5.9-magnitude earthquake damaged a submarine fiber-optic cable, which is a type of undersea cable.

The article includes quotes from a spokesperson for Alaska Communications Systems Group, confirming that the earthquake ""damaged our submarine fiber-optic cable"" and discusses the resulting telecommunications outages in Southeast Alaska.

Furthermore, it highlights the impact of this outage on internet connectivity and businesses in the area, emphasizing that the loss of service affected many customers and disrupted transactions.

This aligns well with the criterion of discussing cut sea cables as a central theme rather than a minor mention."
"Fishing Trawler's €800,000 Damage to Virgin Media's Undersea Cable","€800,000 in damages impacting internet connectivity between Ireland and Britain due to a fishing trawler incident.","https://www.breakingnews.ie/business/fishing-trawler-allegedly-caused-e800000-damage-to-virgin-medias-undersea-cable-1633694.html","2024-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","Tomas Doherty",Yes,"Tomas Doherty","Dublin, Ireland","405","2024-04-06","English","Breaking News","The owners of a fishing trawler which allegedly damaged an undersea fibre optics cable providing internet and telephone connection between Ireland and Britain are being sued in the High Court over the €800,000 cost of repairs.

Virgin Media Wholesale Ltd is suing “the owners and all persons claiming an interest” in the MV The Lida Suzanna trawler over the alleged incident on January 26th, 2015, involving damage to the subsea cable stretching 219km between Dublin at Lytham St Anne's near Blackpool in England. The vessel was allegedly involved in scallop fishing which involves dredging the seabed.

Virgin, which has registered offices in Hampshire, is seeking damages and a declaration that a maritime lien, or claim, attaches to the Irish-registered vessel which is based in Wexford. It also seeks an order for its sale if necessary.

The defendants deny the vessel was responsible for causing damage to the cable and requires proof of this. It is also contended that Virgin is the author of its own misfortune by not taking sufficient measures to bury or protect its cables. Alternatively, it claims Virgin was contributorily negligent.

There was also an alleged failure to protect its cables in an ""area of fishing ground established centuries past"". The defendants say they were doing nothing more than the lawful exploitation of fishing rights and Virgin has no entitlement to expect or demand that fishing be modified, or stopped by reason of the laying of its cable.

The court heard the cable was installed in 1998 by Virgin's predecessor NTL.

It is one of two cables, the Sirius South and the Sirius North, running between Ireland and Britain and if one is damaged, Virgin can switch to the other. There have been 18 instances of damage involving trawlers since it was installed.

Repairs were carried out over the following days by the repair ship, the Pierre de Fermat.

Opening the case on behalf of Virgin on Tuesday, Edward Farrelly SC said it was their case that the defendants should have been or ought to have been aware of the location of the cable which is marked on industry-recognised charts and Ireland's Marine Atlas.

Merchant shipping regulations place a statutory duty on the vessel to carry publications which would have alerted it to the location of the cable, counsel said.

It is further alleged there was a failure to ensure the skipper and/or crew were adequately aware of and/or educated about the location of subsea cables.

The case continues before Mr Justice Denis McDonald.

A Virgin Media spokesperson said: “We have brought this claim following significant damage caused by a fishing trawler to one of our undersea fibre optic cables, and are seeking to recover the costs associated with repairing the cable.

“As a business with millions of customers who rely on fast and reliable connectivity, we hope that through taking this action, third parties will be better aware of the cost that can be involved and disruption it can cause when our cables are damaged.”","The article discusses a legal case involving a fishing trawler that allegedly caused damage to an undersea cable, directly mentioning 'undersea cable' and 'subsea cable'.

It details the implications of the damage on internet connectivity between Ireland and Britain, highlighting the costs associated with repairs and the responsibilities of the involved parties.

The central theme revolves around the incident and its impact, thus satisfying the criterion."

### Overview:

Internet connectivity to the hosts monitored in Japan was maintained, though Round Trip Times (RTT) to some hosts increased significantly. This suggests a possible cable disruption. 

The Japanese Internet largely remained operational, with only one out of six monitored hosts going down temporarily.

### Immediate impacts of earthquake on Japanese hosts seen from SLAC

All monitored hosts stayed up during the earthquake, but there were significant increases in RTTs for some sites.

### Undersea Cables

The earthquake damaged several undersea cables, temporarily knocking out approximately 30% of Japan’s international capacity. Despite this, communications were largely unaffected due to the existing infrastructure.

### Longer term impacts

On Tuesday December 26, 2006 at 12:25 UTC (20:25 local time), a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck off the southwest coast of Taiwan, approximately 22.8 km west southwest of Hengchun, Pingtung County, Taiwan. Eight submarine cables were cut after the earthquake and its aftershocks, catastrophically disrupting Internet services in Asia, affecting many Asian countries. Financial transactions, particularly in the foreign exchange market were seriously affected as well. The 2006 Taiwan Earthquake rendered significant impacts on submarine networks.

**Submarine Cables and Landing Stations in Taiwan**  
As of Dec 2006, there are 8 international submarine cables connecting Taiwan, including APCN, APCN-2, C2C, China-US CN, EAC, FLAG FEA, FNAL/RNAL, and SMW3, landing at Fangshan, Toucheng, Tanshui and Pali cable landing stations.

Geographically, Taiwan locates in the circum-Pacific seismic belt, and the south and east coast of Taiwan are crowded with submarine cables, which makes the Taiwan coast a highly risk area in the submarine networks.

After the earthquake and its aftershocks, 8 submarine cable systems were cut, with 18 cable cuts:

* APCN, 2 cuts  
* APCN-2, 2 cuts  
* C2C, 3 cuts  
* China-US CN, 3 cuts  
* EAC, 3 cuts  
* FLAG FEA, 1 cut  
* FNAL/RNAL, 2 cuts  
* SMW3, 2 cuts  

**Significant Impacts on Communications**  
As results of the earthquake and multiple cable cuts, international communications over submarine networks were seriously disrupted, its impacts were immediately apparent and widely reported over the news media:

* Chunghwa Telecom, the largest operator in Taiwan, reported Internet outage of 100% to HK and South East Asia and 74% to Mainland China.  
* PCCW, the largest operator in Hong Kong, reported more than 50% data capacity down.  
* China Telecom and China Unicom, the top 2 Internet service providers in China, reported outage of more than 90% of traffic to the USA and Europe.  
* Singtel, KDDI etc. also reported serious impact.

The 2006 Taiwan Earthquake rendered on the telecommunications industry not just a disaster, to some extent, far more positive and significant impacts on the submarine networks and the industry:  
* The importance of submarine networks to daily life and business worldwide was massively recognized.  
* The whole industry is reviewing the safety, diversity and resiliency of submarine networks, and preparing corresponding measures.","The article titled 'Submarine Cables Cut after Taiwan Earthquake in Dec 2006' discusses the direct impact of the earthquake on submarine cables, specifically noting that eight submarine cables were cut, leading to catastrophic disruptions in Internet services across Asia.

"Repair Timeline for Damaged West African and South Atlantic Undersea Cables","Repair efforts for the WACS and SAT-3 cables could take months, significantly slowing internet services in southern Africa due to a rockfall incident.","https://technext24.com/2023/08/08/rocks-fall-break-undersea-cables","2023-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","Godfrey Elimian",Yes,"Godfrey Elimian","Nigeria","30000","2023-08-08","English","Technext","The damaged West African Cable System (WACS) and the South Atlantic 3 (SAT-3) undersea cables that have considerably slowed down internet services in southern Africa would likely take months to fix. This is due to the current location of the specialised cable repair vessel, the Léon Thévenin, which is supposed to undertake the repair.

In an unforeseen turn of events, a rockfall within the Congo Canyon inflicted significant damage to the undersea cables according to reports from MyBroadband.

The incident, which occurred on a Sunday, significantly impacted network connectivity within that region. The precise location of the cable breaks has been pinpointed using the systems’ advanced Coherent Optical Time Domain Reflectometer, identifying the fault zone to be situated between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Cameroon.

The SAT-3 connection was suddenly cut off on Sunday morning, and later that evening, the WACS network experienced unexpected downtime. This unforeseen break in the undersea cables has caused concern, and Telkom’s team is working hard to fix the issue.

Acknowledging the gravity of the situation, Openserve, a division of Telkom responsible for wholesale and network operations, has verified the cable breaks and offered reassurance regarding the minimal operational impact.

> “We are collaborating with the consortium partners to facilitate the restoration of these cables,” an Openserve spokesperson commented.

Regrettably, due to the location of the incident site, approximately 3,600km northwest of South Africa, a realistic timeline for repair efforts has emerged. Experts estimate that it will likely take a span of one month, possibly stretching into September, for a specialised cable repair vessel, the Léon Thévenin, to navigate its way to the fault site, contingent on when it is done with the current repairs ongoing on another cable system.

The cable-laying ship, Léon Thévenin, designated for deep-water repairs, is a crucial player in the restoration efforts. Its arrival at the WACS fault site is projected within the initial weeks of September, dependent on prevailing weather conditions.

Openserve said the impact on its network was limited to customers using international private leased circuit services. While the situation has posed some challenges for the affected network, Openserve has managed to mitigate the impact on its operations through strategic investment in alternative international cable capacities.

“The Openserve network remains robust due to our investment in other international cable capacities; hence, all Openserve IP Transit Services (WebReach) traffic has been automatically re-routed.”","The article titled ""Damaged West African and South Atlantic 3 undersea cables could take months to fix"" directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables by discussing the significant damage to the West African Cable System (WACS) and the South Atlantic 3 (SAT-3) undersea cables.

**Author**: Tara Davenport  
**Published Date**: 03/27/2020  

The international community’s ever-increasing reliance on the Internet and web-based information and communications technologies (“ICT”) has meant that cybersecurity is becoming one of the most pressing concerns in the 21st century. The International Telecommunications Union (“ITU”) has defined cybersecurity to mean “the collection of tools, policies, security concepts, security safeguards, guidelines, risk management approaches, actions, training, best practices, assurance and technologies that can be used to protect the cyber environment and organization and user’s assets.”  

The discussions on cybersecurity in international policy and academic circles have focused primarily on how to protect the information that exists in cyberspace. A glaring omission from this discussion is the security of the physical infrastructure that underpins the virtual cloud of cyberspace, namely the security of the submarine fiber optic network. These submarine communication cables—which are hidden from plain view—form a vast network on the seabed, are often no bigger than a garden hose, and transmit massive amounts of data across oceans. They provide over 95% of international telecommunications—not via satellites as is commonly assumed.  

Notwithstanding their status as critical communications infrastructure, submarine cable systems remain vulnerable to a variety of emerging cybersecurity challenges. This Article will examine the relationship between submarine cables and cybersecurity in the context of these challenges, and whether the current legal regimes are adequate in ensuring the security of the vast network of cables that cross the ocean floor, and thus the security of the world’s telecommunications systems.","The article 'Submarine Cables, Cybersecurity and International Law: An Intersectional Analysis' by Tara Davenport discusses submarine cables extensively, highlighting their role in global telecommunications and the cybersecurity threats they face.

Recent data of [cyber security facts](https://www.satelliteinternetnow.com/blog/top-cybersecurity-facts-figures/) have shown the extent of how much cybercrime is actually happening all the time across the world, where many forms of data are not thought about needing protection from hackers. Unfortunately, people buy and use their technology thinking that the relevant cybersecurity features have already been implemented for them. But this is simply not the case. For example, if you use your mobile phone primarily for your work, you should take the time to see how something like the [Microsoft Intune mobile security](https://pradeo.com/en-US/mobile-threat-defense) application can help to ensure that your mobile is safe from hackers and that you can go about your business without being concerned about a breach.

Though this is something that could be beneficial, there are still many things that make people and companies vulnerable to cybercrime. Undersea data cables form an often overlooked and very under-rated part of data transmission worldwide. In fact, about [four hundred cables](https://blog.telegeography.com/frequently-asked-questions-about-undersea-submarine-cables) carry close to [99%](http://www.newsweek.com/undersea-cables-transport-99-percent-international-communications-319072) of trans-oceanic data, making them a critical resource for the economies of the world. These cables act as pillars to the digital age we live in today, and what makes the situation interesting, is that this worldwide infrastructure rests solely in the hands of private corporations.

Today’s dynamic and complex geopolitical scenario make the safety and structural integrity of these cables a major security concern. Furthermore, it is no secret that data cables should only be fitted by [professional data cable installers](https://www.voicecomplus.com/). However, negligible attention has been paid to the international legal framework in place to deal with damage or harm caused to these cables, which are the backbone of the world’s internet.

### Threats to Undersea Cables
Threats to undersea cables can be linked to either physical or network attacks.

**Physical Attack**  
Physical damage to undersea cables is often caused by accident, due to careless fishing or anchors of ships. However, both historically and recently, physical damage to cables has been intentional in nature as well.

During the First World War, Britain [succeeded in severing](https://warandsecurity.com/2014/08/05/britain-cuts-german-cable-communications-5-august-1914/) all but one of Germany’s telegraph lines. They tapped into the last one, and used it to intercept strategically vital communications. In retaliation, the Germans attacked British telegraph cable sites in the Pacific Ocean. The above incident highlights important loopholes in protection of cables, namely:

1.  Direct cutting;
2.  Tapping; and
3.  Targeting of landing sites.

More recently, it was estimated by Bangladesh that an intentional outage of cable lines caused a local telecommunication company losses amounting to about $1million. In 2013, Egyptian officials [arrested scuba divers](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/RhHb2bR1ZVIaarxSF5VqlK/Egypt-arrests-scuba-divers-accused-of-cutting-Internet-cable.html) who were allegedly attempting to cut off a cable line off the port of Alexandria. The effects of damage to these cables are acute in nature, as is evident from the earthquake in Taiwan, which caused significant damage to a collection of cable lines. The disaster led to a [major disruption of internet](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/27/world/asia/27iht-quake.4032404.html?pagewanted=all) across Asia, and led to months of slow connectivity.

**Network Attacks**  
In today’s digital age, cables also face a genuine threat from virtual attacks. Submarine cables ([which are very expensive](https://gigaom.com/2012/07/09/a-visual-guide-to-undersea-cables-and-their-5-5b-price-tag/)) are managed and controlled by companies which often use commonplace network-management-software to control wavelengths of data. These systems allow controllers to monitor data traffic and also ensure supervisory control. Unfortunately, many of these management systems are linked to the internet because they are connected to remote operating centres across the world. This makes them vulnerable to attacks, as they use rudimentary systems such as Linux and Windows. In a [paper](https://citizenlab.ca/cybernorms2012/sechrist.pdf) published by the Harvard Kennedy School, Michael Sechrist argues that hackers could easily gain “_administrative level access to a cable management system_“. This would allow the hacker to view cable vulnerabilities, network and data flows, and enable him/her to detrimentally disrupt data traffic.

### International Law on Damage to Submarine Cables
The first conclusive and tangible international action to protect these cables was the [Convention on the Protection of Submarine Cables](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/us-treaties/bevans/m-ust000001-0089.pdf), signed in 1884. The treaty applies to all those cables which are outside the territorial waters of states and requires nations to incorporate the treaty provisions into domestic law. Article 2 states that “_the breaking or injury of a submarine cables, done wilfully or through culpable negligence…shall be a punishable offense_.” An important point to note is that Article 15 lays down that its provisions “_shall in no wise [sic] affect the liberty of action of belligerents_.” This makes the Convention inapplicable during wartime.

Marine law is also fundamental to the protection of undersea cables. The 1958 Geneva Conference addressed submarine cables in two documents, namely, [Convention on the High Seas](http://www.gc.noaa.gov/documents/8_1_1958_high_seas.pdf) (High Seas Convention) and the [Convention on the Continental Shelf](https://treaties.un.org/Pages/showDetails.aspx?objid=08000002800338fb). Article 27 of the High Seas Convention addresses damage to cables, but fails to clearly prohibit the intentional damage to them. It leaves the persecutory powers on signatories, by stating that the party should “_take necessary legislative measures_” to make breaking of cables a “_punishable offense_.”

The [United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea](http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf) (UNCLOS), signed in 1982, [superseded](http://www.continentalshelf.org/about/1143.aspx) the Conventions signed in Geneva. The UNCLOS is a landmark treaty and has been fairly influential in the international sphere. UNCLOS addresses undersea cables in different chapters. Articles 113-115 of UNCLOS replicate the 1958 Geneva Conventions, and lay down that signatories must enact domestic legislation to penalise damage to cables by ships or persons belonging to their jurisdictions. UNCLOS also grants states the autonomy to undertake economic activities as per their discretion, in Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), which extend to 200 nautical miles beyond states’ territorial waters. Laying of cables within the EEZ is one of the multiple freedoms accorded to states that are parties to UNCLOS. Article 79 of UNCLOS allows states the freedom to lay cables on the continental shelf.

### International Law on Cyber Attacks
It is indeed surprising that presently, no international treaty addresses cyber warfare operations, despite a United Nations (UN) sanctioned group [concluding](http://undocs.org/A/68/156/Add.1) that international law and the UN Charter, both, are applicable to cyberspace.

[The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare](https://www.peacepalacelibrary.nl/ebooks/files/356296245.pdf) (the Manual) lays down provisions with relation to submarine cables. International law protection has been extended to submarine communication cables. The explanation to Rule 54 accords states sovereignty over submarine cables in their territorial waters, stating that _“[T]hey generally are treated in the same fashion as cyber infrastructure located on land territory_.” The Manual also states that protection of undersea cables has risen to a norm of customary international law and it would be in states’ best interests to protect the right of all states to lay cables. Also, the Manual makes it clear that it is inapplicable during wartime, by stating that it is _“without prejudice to the rules applicable during armed conflict.”_

It is pertinent to note that while cables are somewhat protected by international instruments, there exists a school of thought that advocates for the wartime protection of these cables, reasoning that these cables become legitimate targets during times of war, owing to their obvious importance.

Yet in a handful of these sleepy coastal communities can be found one of our nation’s most serious, and overlooked, security threats.

When we send an email, use a mobile or make a bank payment, most of us have a vague idea that it speeds to its destination via wireless signals, perhaps bouncing off a satellite en route. But the truth is that 97 per cent of global communications travel along a network of just 200 fibre‑optic cable systems that run along our oceans’ floors.

This physical network is the indispensable infrastructure of the 21st century. Thin as hosepipes, these cables carry some $10 trillion of financial transactions a day and underpin the operation of every computer in the world. But they are vulnerable.

Their deep-sea locations are both isolated and publicly available. Their routes often concentrate at specific choke points, and severing them would require little expertise. Either on land or sea, these jugulars of the world economy are a singularly attractive target to our enemies – whether they be an increasingly bellicose Russian navy or a terrorist group. A successful attack has the potential to cripple Britain’s security and prosperity.

Undersea cables have typically been installed and owned by private companies ever since the first was laid under the Atlantic in 1858. This means that most states have not given the network the priority attention it merits.

The main threat comes from the sea. Russia is investing in its navy and especially in submarines capable of damaging undersea cables undetected. Moscow’s increasing technical capability is matched by a display of maritime belligerence not seen since the Cold War. US intelligence officials have identified a sustained pattern of Russian submarines “aggressively operating” near the busiest data highway in the world between New York and London.

The Taiwan earthquake in 2006 shows the sort of damage that any disruption can cause. Underwater landslides severed cables, regional currency markets ground to a halt, Hong Kong lost almost all communications and millions of mobile phones instantly cut out. With both the Prime Minister and the chief of the National Cyber Security Centre highlighting new, unconventional forms of Russian aggression, these risks must be taken seriously.

The second threat is on land. For commercial and geographical reasons, undersea cables tend to come ashore at just a few remote sites, presenting terrorists with an easy way to cripple Britain’s internet capacity. According to documents released by WikiLeaks, the US State Department considers several UK cable landing sites to be as “critical” to American security as its military facilities – except they are protected by little more than a skeleton team of techies and a sturdy gate. They are particularly vulnerable to attack.

Yet, as I set out today in a Policy Exchange report, there are some quick steps we can take to improve Britain’s resilience. Security at cable landing sites should be beefed up. Like Australia, we could establish Cable Protection Zones in sea corridors to better police maritime activity. Private companies should install monitoring equipment on their undersea cables, as well as “dark cables” to provide emergency capacity.

Furthermore, as we decide the UK’s future defence priorities, it is paramount that we protect the freedom of the seas and sea lanes of communication. Britain and her Nato allies must ensure that our maritime capabilities get the investment they need to counter these new, unconventional threats.

When Russia annexed Crimea, one of its first moves was to take control of the peninsula’s primary cable exchange and sever its main connection. It is a precedent we should heed. In the information age, Britain’s security and prosperity rest on our ability to communicate effectively with the world. Unless we act now, our century’s greatest innovation could be its undoing.

Published by The Lawfare Institute in Cooperation With  

One of the U.S. economy’s most critical resources is the massive network of undersea cables that transverse the globe, carrying the overwhelming majority of all internet traffic. Over 400 fiber optic cables carry 99% of transoceanic data, providing the physical links that bind our digital world together. This global infrastructure rests almost entirely in the hands of private companies.

In the modern geopolitical environment, the vulnerability of undersea communications cables stands out as an acute cyber security concern. Relatively little attention, however, has focused on the legal frameworks that govern the networks of glass and steel that form the literal backbone of our internet. This post lays out the threats to communications cables and the existing international laws protecting cables from intentional damage.

**Threats to Undersea Cables**  

_Physical Attack_

Physical damage is the most direct threat to undersea cables. Such damage is usually accidental—often the cause is fishing ship nets and anchors. But history is rife with examples of navies intentionally attacking cables. At the outbreak of World War I, Britain severed all but one of Germany’s undersea telegraph lines. The British tapped the remaining cable, which allowed them to intercept communications (including those with important geopolitical consequences, such as the Zimmerman telegram that helped push the U.S. into the war). The Germans, lacking a fleet of cable ships of their own, attacked British telegraph cable landing sites in the Pacific Ocean. This case illustrates three cable vulnerabilities that still exist today: direct cutting, tapping and targeting landing sites.

States have long recognized that cables are vital to secure communication. In 1959, a Soviet trawler cut five cables off the coast of Newfoundland, prompting the U.S. to send a radar ship to board the trawler under the provisions of the 1884 Submarine Cable Convention. (The 1884 treaty prohibits intentional damage to cables and allows navies to board vessels to investigate reports of damage.) The incident was followed by a diplomatic exchange of notes in which the United States said: “The protection of submarine telecommunications cables on the high seas constitutes an international obligation.”

More recently, Bangladeshi authorities determined that an intentional cable outage in 2007 cost Bangladesh’s telecommunication company over $1 million. In 2013, Egyptian authorities discovered three scuba divers attempting to cut a cable off the port of Alexandria. The cable industry estimates that over 150 faults in cable connectivity occur every year, but because the vast majority are isolated incidents, network redundancy limits their effects. It is far more problematic to lose all cables in a specific area: An 2006 earthquake off the coast of Taiwan struck a concentration of cables in the nearby ocean and disrupted internet traffic across Asia, causing months of slow connectivity.

Recognizing the grave possible consequences, the United States takes threats to cables seriously. In 2015, Russian ships and submarines near cable routes around the world caused concern within the U.S. intelligence community that Russia was attempting to tap or cut critical internet communications lines. A Cold War-style drama played out between the Russian subs following cable lines and the American ships, subs and spy satellites tracking them. These incidents highlighted the danger of cutting cables in deep water, where repairing them could take weeks or months.

_Network Attack_

Today, in addition to physical threats, submarine cable systems face significant virtual vulnerabilities. The consortiums of companies that operate submarine cables (which are worth hundreds of millions of dollars) use network-management software to control the wavelengths that transmit gigabits of data at high speed along the ocean floor. These systems allow operators to monitor data traffic, see cable faults, and add or drop wavelengths transmitting data (resembling other Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems). They enable remote control of entire cables and are vulnerable to a wide array of attacks because they use common operating systems like Linux and Windows. Furthermore, network management systems often are connected to remote operating centers through networked connections and even linked to the internet. Michael Sechrist wrote about the systems’ risks:

> What is the nightmare scenario? A hacker penetrates a cable management system, gains administrative rights, and hacks into the presentation server … Hackers could then attain unprecedented top-level views of multiple cable networks and data flows, discover physical cable vulnerabilities, and disrupt and divert data traffic. With that access, hackers/attackers can gain a potential “kill click” – with a click of a mouse they can delete wavelengths and, potentially, significantly disrupt or alter global Internet traffic routes.

Many network management systems are not up-to-date, including older Siemens systems. The Stuxnet worm hit Siemens SCADA systems worldwide and ultimately targeted Iran’s nuclear centrifuges—highlighting how malware can attack critical infrastructure vulnerabilities. One Stuxnet lesson of relevance to undersea cables is how the virus masked its presence by feeding false information to monitoring centers. If a piece of malware similarly hides its effects on cable traffic, the time it would take to identify the faults with the system could prolong global disruptions.

**International Law on Damage to Submarine Cables**

Understanding the international laws governing cables is essential to protecting them.

First, international law differentiates between attacks on cables and espionage. Spying operations on cables consist of passively tapping the information coming through the pipes at landing sites. (For more on the jurisdictional issues involving the legality of cable tapping, see section 4 of Tara Davenport’s article on the subject.)

The earliest international law agreement on the topic is the Convention on the Protection of Submarine Cables, signed in Paris in 1884. The treaty applies to all cables outside the territorial waters of states and requires all states to incorporate its protections into their domestic law. (The relevant U.S. provision is 47 U.S.C. § 21-39.) Article 2 mandates that “the breaking or injury of a submarine cables, done willfully or through culpable negligence...shall be a punishable offense.” In Article 12, the parties agree to implement national legislation to impose the penalties for violating the treaty. Notably, Article 15 says its provisions “shall in no wise [sic] affect the liberty of action of belligerents.” Thus, in wartime, the protections do not apply.

Maritime law is also important to undersea cable governance. The 1958 Geneva Conference on the Law of the Sea addressed submarine cables in two treaties, the Convention on the High Seas and the Convention on the Continental Shelf. The High Seas Convention included the submarine cable protections of the 1884 Convention but in the context of the “freedom to lay submarine cables,” a fundamental freedoms of the high seas “recognized by the general principles of international law.” Article 27 addresses damage to cables, but it does not explicitly prohibit the intentional damage to them. Instead, it mandates that states party to the treaty “take the necessary legislative measures” to make breaking a cable a “punishable offense.”

The 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) superseded the 1958 Geneva Conventions. This landmark agreement addressed submarine cables in multiple chapters. Articles 113-115 replicate the language from the 1958 convention requiring states to enact domestic legislation to protect cables, ensuring that damage to cables is treated as a serious offense.","The article titled ""Cutting the Cord: The Legal Regime Protecting Undersea Cables"" by Matt Gluck provides a comprehensive discussion on the legal frameworks surrounding undersea cables, including the threats they face, which directly relates to the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables.

It mentions incidents where cables were intentionally severed, such as the 1959 incident involving a Soviet trawler and the British actions during World War I. The article elaborates on the implications of damage to undersea cables, detailing both historical and contemporary examples of threats.

It discusses the significance of undersea cables to global internet traffic and how damage to these cables can disrupt telecommunications.

The specter of trouble with the undersea cables could be a huge deal, although experts said that there is so much redundancy that much of the risk is mitigated. There were some reports attributed to cable operators who said they had experienced power issues but back-up generators prevented service disruption.

**Update: (5:30 p.m. EDT)** Level 3 Communications, just emailed a statement about the status of the AC-2 cable:

> _“We made extensive preparations in advance of the storm and have experienced no major service disruptions. All of our subsea cable systems are operating normally. We have experienced a minor fiber cut to one of our diversely routed, secondary backhaul lines which provides connectivity to our AC2 Cable Landing Station, and our technicians are currently working to repair it as quickly as possible. Few customers were affected because most traffic was rerouted through redundant lines. And again, the AC2 subsea cable itself is operating normally.”_

Carriers and ISPs use the cables to pump data across the Atlantic. Two of the major gateways are in Brookhaven, N.Y., (on Long Island) and in northern New Jersey, where the cables come ashore. “Given the duration and strength of this storm, you have to worry about the cables getting disrupted,” said an executive with a data center company who did not want to be named. He said problems with the cables is “the kind of thing companies will keep close to the vest. If either AC-1 or AC-2 were to go out there would be major, major issues.”

As already reported, data center facilities in lower Manhattan suffered a string of outages after flooding and Con Ed cut electrical power. Datagram, the web hosting company that serves the Huffington Post, Gawker, Gizmodo and BuzzFeed, went down Monday evening after flooding caused those sites to go dark. Data centers at Google-owned Carrier Hotel on 8th Avenue, including Equinix, XO Communications and others were also reportedly affected by power outages, though it appears some are back up and running. And Atlantic Metro Communications also reported disruptions due to flooding at a New York data center.

**Abstract**  
Rishi Sunak is the Member of Parliament for Richmond (Yorkshire). He was elected in 2015 and has the privilege of representing both the Army's largest garrison, Catterick Garrison, and also RAF Leeming. Before entering Parliament, Rishi spent his professional career in business and finance, living and working internationally.

**Executive Summary**  
In the digital age of cloud computing, the idea that steel and plastic pipes are integral to our life seems anachronistic. Nothing could be further than the truth. Our ability to transmit confidential information, conduct financial transactions, and communicate internationally all depend upon a global network of physical cables lying under the sea. Comprising more than half a million miles of fibre-optics, this network is the indispensable infrastructure of the 21st century.

**Chapter 1: The Vital Importance of Undersea Cables**  
• The UK and the world is highly dependent on undersea communications cables.  
• 97% of global communications are still transmitted via cables lying deep beneath the oceans.  
• In a single day, these cables carry some $10 trillion of financial transfers and process some 15 million financial transactions.

**Chapter 2: Cables Have Inadequate Protection in International Law**  
• Undersea cables are largely owned and installed by private communications companies, leading to neglect by national governments.  
• Current international law is highly deficient in ensuring the security of undersea cables.

**Chapter 3: The Threats to Undersea Cables**  
• Sabotage of undersea cable infrastructure is an existential threat to the UK.  
• The location of almost every undersea cable in the world is publicly available, making them uniquely vulnerable.

**Chapter 4: The Risk from Russia**  
• Russia has experience and interest in using unconventional means of warfare, like disrupting communications networks.  
• Russia is investing significantly in its naval capacity and plans to have the world's second largest navy by 2027.

**Chapter 5: Recommendations**  
1. The next Strategic Defence and Security Review should specifically consider the risks to Britain's security from attacks on its undersea cable infrastructure.
2. Establish Cable Protection Zones in areas with high value communication corridors.
3. Require cable owners to place sensors that detect sonar frequencies near key undersea infrastructure.

Underwater fiber optic cables are responsible for transmitting 97 percent of global communications and $10 trillion in daily financial transactions, yet they are dangerously exposed, according to a new report in Policy Exchange, a London-based think-tank.  

The report, ""Undersea Cables: Indispensable, insecure"", found that the submerged communication cables are ""inadequately protected and highly vulnerable to attack at sea and on land"" and recommends increased protection. Leaders from the Department of Defense have said the Pentagon is investing $600 million in undersea systems over the next five years.  

The cables come above water in several remote locations. These locations are publicly available and have minimal security, leaving them highly vulnerable to attacks from hostile state and non-state actors, according to the report.  

Worse? The report points to Russia as a country that is likely to exploit this vulnerability by severing or tapping into the data lines. A sever in the cables could be catastrophic to web, while tapping into the lines could provide critical information about the world’s internet traffic.  

“When Russia annexed Crimea, one of its first moves was to sever the main cable connection to the outside world,” warned Rishi Sunak, the author of the report and a conservative member of Britain’s parliament. “A successful attack on the UK’s undersea cable infrastructure would be an existential threat to our security.”  

Crew members load supplies on USS Tennessee in the Atlantic Ocean. Exposed data cables in the North Atlantic seem to have caught the eye of Russian submarines in recent months. (Photo by Lt. Joe Painter/U.S. Navy)  

In December, the Washington Post reported that Russian submarines were antagonizing NATO by increasing naval activity around data cables in the North Atlantic, which provide internet and other communication connections to the United States and Europe.  

“We are now seeing Russian underwater activity in the vicinity of undersea cables that I don’t believe we have ever seen,” U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Andrew Lennon, the commander of NATO’s submarine forces told the Post. “Russia is clearly taking an interest in NATO and NATO nations’ undersea infrastructure.”  

The Policy Exchange report recommends developing a new international treaty to protect undersea cables as well as increasing security at vulnerable cable sites.","The article titled 'How exposed deep-sea cables could leave the economy vulnerable to a Russian attack' discusses the vulnerability of undersea cables, explicitly mentioning their potential to be severed and the implications of such actions.

The article highlights a specific example where Russia severed a main cable connection during the annexation of Crimea, emphasizing the existential threat this poses to security.

Furthermore, it discusses increased Russian naval activity around these cables, indicating a direct concern regarding their security.

**Author:** Sebastian Moss  
**Published Date:** 12/04/2017  

Terrorists and Russia are highlighted as risks to international connectivity.

The influential center-right think tank Policy Exchange has published a report warning of the dangers of attacks on submarine telecommunications cables, written by Rishi Sunak, a member of the UK Parliament.

While submarine cable networks are mostly redundant, the report warns that well-orchestrated attacks could cripple the economy or put military communications at risk.

### That sinking feeling  
The report, titled ‘Undersea Cables: Indispensable, insecure,’ details various threats to submarine cables, which account for 95 to 97 percent of transoceanic digital communications.

Usually, cuts to submarine cables are accidental, with the report noting: “As with so many things, the most straightforward threat to undersea cables is posed by unintended error rather than conspiracy. The United Nations estimates that between 100-150 cables are damaged annually with the most frequent culprit being fishing activity.

While potentially costly to their owners, accidental faults of this kind pose a relatively limited direct threat to advanced economies thanks to the highly diversified nature of their cable networks.

The real danger, the report claims, is from malicious attacks that aim to take out multiple cables at once. It states: “While the diversity of cable connections to economies like the UK and US offer enough resilience to ensure that accidental damage does not pose a realistic threat of a catastrophic outage, co-ordinated sabotage on multiple cables has the potential to pose a major threat to the UK.

One case highlighted in the report is that of the December 2008 Italy-Egypt accident, when shipping traffic cut three cables, reducing connectivity by 80 percent.

With the US military relying on commercial cable networks for the majority of its strategic communications, this impacted the ongoing Iraq war - notably the US Air Force drone warfare efforts.

Closer to home, the impact of cable damage would most heavily be felt by the financial sector, with roughly 213 cables carrying an estimated $10 trillion of financial transfers and 15 million financial transactions every day.

The report states: “Put simply, if an adversary were to succeed in executing a successful attack against Britain’s undersea cable infrastructure the result would be financial disaster on an unprecedented scale.

### Beware of the bear  
As for who would have an interest in wreaking havoc in international waters, the report repeatedly points a finger at Russia, whose Yantar class intelligence ships and auxiliary submarines include the necessary equipment for cutting submarine cables.

In a foreword, Admiral James Stavridis, USN (Ret), former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe, notes that the overwhelming military advantage of NATO forces over Russian troops could result in the country avoiding conventional conflict and focusing instead on attacks against asymmetric targets, like fiber-optic cables.

And then there’s the risk of terrorism.

Non-state actors would struggle to impact the same number of cables as a nation-state, although this is still a possibility - the location of cables is made public to avoid fishing vessels accidentally dropping anchors on them, something a terrorist could do intentionally.

Another, perhaps easier to reach, target for terrorists could be found in cable landing stations. ”Partly in order to reduce costs, and partly because it is rare to find a location with the geographical suitability to be a landing site, multiple cables frequently share a single landing site through which data is re-routed to users.

### Recommendations  
With readers suitably unnerved by a litany of threats, the report makes nine UK-focused recommendations:  
1.  Strategic Defence And Security Review - The next Strategic Defence Review should take into account the threat to attacks on submarine cable infrastructure.  
2.  National Risk Assessment and Risk Register - The next National Risk Assessment (held every two years) should look into the risk of these attacks.  
3.  Secure Landing Sites - The government should instruct the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) to carry out a full review of how landing sites are protected.  
4.  Establish Cable Protection Zones - The report states that Britain should establish Australian-style Cable Protection Zones (CPZs) around its coast in areas with cable corridors.  
5.  Deploy Better Monitoring Equipment on Cables - The report states that cable laying companies could be “required to place relatively cheap sensors that detect sonar frequencies near key undersea infrastructure and along cable routes.  
6.  Broaden Geographic Diversity - The report wants Britain to use its influence as a key geographic bridge between the US and Europe to work with the private sector and overseas governments to increase the geographic diversity of submarine cables.  
7.  Increase the Supply of “Dark Cables” - The government could encourage backup cable systems and redundant networks by offering tax incentives.  
8.  Strengthen International Law Protecting Cables - The report states that the UK should push for the adoption of a “new international treaty that protects submarine cables.  
9.  Increase NATO Naval Exercises and Review Maritime Capabilities - The report wants the UK to press at the NATO level to promote the undertaking of naval exercises and war games to hone potential responses to an attack on undersea cable infrastructure.  

In response to the report, a UK government spokesperson said the issue was being taken “extremely seriously.”","The article titled ""UK think tank warns of threats to submarine cables"" discusses various threats to submarine telecommunications cables, which are crucial for international connectivity.

It directly mentions 'submarine cables' and elaborates on the risks posed by both accidental and malicious attacks.

"Virgin Media's Lawsuit Against Fishing Trawler for Subsea Cable Damage","Lawsuit filed for damages impacting Virgin Media's operations; cable breaks common due to fishing trawlers' activities.","https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2024/06/virgin-media-sues-fishing-trawler-for-allegedly-damaging-subsea-cable.html","2024-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","Mark Jackson",Yes,"Mark Jackson",-,"10000","2024-06-06","English","ISPreview","The wholesale division of broadband and Ethernet provider Virgin Media UK (VMO2) are suing the ""owners and all persons claiming an interest"" in a fishing trawler, the Irish-registered MV The Lida Suzanna, for €800k (£680k) after the ship allegedly damaged one of their subsea fibre optic cables between Ireland and England.

The **Sirius South** cable itself was originally deployed in 1998 by **NTL**, which later became part of Virgin Media after the merger with Telewest. Virgin also operates a second cable on a similar route called **Sirius North**, which affords them some redundancy should one of the two links end up being damaged.

**NOTE:** There have been 18 instances of damage, allegedly involving trawlers, since the Sirius cables were installed.

Sadly, cable breaks are not uncommon on subsea routes. Most such damage occurs due to accidents by deep sea fishing trawlers, as well as ships dragging their anchor over them or marine life deciding to take a nibble (smaller cables have been broken by hungry sharks in the past, but modern cables tend to be resistant). A whole industry exists to repair such cables, but it often takes a few days or weeks to fix related damage.

In this case, Virgin Media has claimed in the High Court that the vessel in question was allegedly conducting scallop fishing, which involves dredging the seabed. According to Breaking News, Virgin Media wants the vessel’s owners to pay damages and, failing that, they would like to see it sold to help pay off the claim.

> **A Virgin Media spokesperson said:**
> ""We have brought this claim following significant damage caused by a fishing trawler to one of our undersea fibre optic cables, and are seeking to recover the costs associated with repairing the cable.
> As a business with millions of customers who rely on fast and reliable connectivity, we hope that through taking this action, third parties will be better aware of the cost that can be involved and disruption it can cause when our cables are damaged.""

Cases like this can be complicated and tricky to pursue, which may help to explain why it’s taken so long for this one to reach the courts. In keeping with that, the vessel’s owners have denied that they were the cause of the damage and have asked for proof of this. The owners have also accused Virgin of being negligent by failing to take sufficient measures to protect the cable when it was installed, such as by burying it.

Finally, the owners claim that the location is an ""area of fishing ground established centuries past"" and that they were doing nothing more than the lawful exploitation of fishing rights. The owners say that Virgin Media has no entitlement to expect or demand that fishing be modified, or stopped, just because it laid a cable across the same area.

However, Virgin Media contends that shipping regulations require such vessels to carry publications that would have alerted the vessel’s owners to the location of subsea cables, and that there was also an alleged failure to ensure the skipper and/or crew were adequately aware of the location of such cables.

Virgin has previously filed a similar case again the MV Willie Joe trawler, which was settled in 2022.","The article titled ""Virgin Media Sues Fishing Trawler for Allegedly Damaging Subsea Cable"" discusses a lawsuit filed by Virgin Media against a fishing trawler for allegedly damaging one of their subsea fibre optic cables.

It directly mentions 'subsea cables' and provides context about the implications of such damage, including the financial claims and the operational impact on Virgin Media.

The article states that 'cable breaks are not uncommon on subsea routes' and that 'most such damage occurs due to accidents by deep sea fishing trawlers'.

This shows that the topic of cut sea cables is treated as a central theme, not just a minor mention.

Therefore, the article satisfies the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables."

The horrific earthquake and the ensuing tsunami in Japan have caused widespread damage to undersea communications, according to data collected by telecom industry sources. Initially, it was thought that the damage to the cables that connect Japan and Asia to each other and other parts of the world was limited, but new data shows the extent of the problems.  
According to research firm, Telegeography, the following cables have been damaged:  
* APCN-2, which is an intra-Asian cable, forms a ring linking China, Hong Kong, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan.  
* Pacific Crossing West and Pacific Crossing North, which are out of service.  
* PacNet has reported outages on segments of its East Asia Crossing network.  
* Korea Telecom reports that a segment of the Japan-U.S. Cable Network is damaged.  
* NTT has reported damage to some segments of the PC-1 submarine cable system.  
Most of the damaged network routers land in the Ajigaura or Kitabaraki landing stations, which are between Tokyo and Sendai (see map.) The tsunami and earthquake have not damaged Japan’s cable landing stations that are in the South of Tokyo, or on other side of the sheltered inlet that becomes Tokyo Bay, Telegeography said.  
“We’re not aware of disruptions to any of the many cables that land here,” Stephan Beckart of Telegeography wrote in an email. “All of the cable systems that have reported outages also operate cables that land to the South of Tokyo, so no system appears to have suffered a complete outage.  
A report from Dow Jones Newswires suggests most companies are working hard to fix the network problems. The Dow Jones report has the following additional details:  
* KDDI says its cable between the U.S. and Japan is broken and it cannot transmit signals.  
* NTT is using back-up cable systems.  
* PCCW says the Internet traffic to the U.S. is slow.  
In a story on Friday, Stacey Higginbotham pointed out that Chunghwa of Taiwan had reported an outage on the APCN-2 system, while China Unicom had reported some unspecified damage to “two or three cables.” There is clear decline in Japan’s Internet performance, according to the data from JPNAP.","The article titled ""In Japan, Many Undersea Cables Are Damaged"" discusses the significant damage to various undersea cables as a direct result of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.

It mentions specific cables that were affected, including the APCN-2, Japan-U.S. Cable Network, and PC-1 submarine cable system.

The article emphasizes the implications of these damages, such as outages reported by KDDI and NTT, and the slowdown of internet traffic to the U.S. due to these disruptions.

This focus on the damages to undersea cables and their impact on telecommunications and internet connectivity clearly aligns with the criterion of being an article on the topic of cut sea cables.

Therefore, it satisfies the criterion."

December 27, 2006 / 5:47 AM EST / CBS/AP  

Telephone and Internet service was disrupted across Asia on Wednesday after a powerful earthquake off Taiwan's southern tip damaged undersea cables used by phone customers and Web surfers from Japan to Southeast Asia and the United States.

Repairing the cables harmed by Tuesday's tremor — which killed two people — could take three weeks but ""quality will improve day by day,"" said Lin Jen-hung, vice general manager of Chunghwa Telecom Co., Taiwan's largest phone company.

The 6.7-magnitude quake — which triggered a tsunami alert — damaged two of the seven undersea cables near Taiwan used by several countries to route calls and Internet traffic, Chunghwa said. Crews fixing the cables would have to pull them up and transfer them to a ship for repair, the company said.

The damage to the two lines, located in the south, cut off 50 percent to 60 percent of Chunghwa's overall telephone capacity, the company said. Most severely affected were connections to China, Japan and Southeast Asia, it said.

Also hard hit was telephone service to the U.S., where 60 percent of capacity was lost, the company said.

Chunghwa also said 98 percent of Taiwan's communications capacity with Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Hong Kong was disrupted.

Hong Kong telephone company PCCW Ltd., which also provides Internet service, said the quake cut its data capacity in half. Many Internet users were unable to access Web sites in parts of America, Taiwan and South Korea. Calls to Taiwan weren't connecting.

Internet access has been cut or has become extremely slow in Beijing, said an official from China Netcom, China's No. 2 phone company.

The official, who would not give his name, said the cause was thought to be the earthquake, but he had no further details.

Businesses in various parts of the city also said they were experiencing Internet access problems.

CCTV, the state-run television network, said China Telecom Corp., China's biggest phone company, was contacting counterparts in the U.S. and Europe about using satellites to make up for the shortfall.

KDDI Corp., Japan's major carrier for international calls, said its fixed-line telephone service was affected by the quake. Company spokesman Haruhiko Maeda said customers were having trouble calling India and the Middle East, which are usually use the cables near Taiwan. Maeda said the company was rerouting calls to go through the U.S. and Europe and the company did not know how long it will take to repair the cables.

Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said that international roaming service provided by Japan's major three telecommunications — NTT DoCoMO, KDDI, and Softbank, was affected. Ministry official Akira Yamanaka said that some customers were unable to make calls using their mobile phones in countries including Taiwan.

South Korea's largest telecom company, KT, said that lines it uses were damaged, affecting dozens of companies and institutions, including South Korea's Foreign Ministry.

However, the quake didn't cause problems for ordinary people using Internet and telephone service, according to Ku Ja-hong, a KT spokesman.

The quake, which hit offshore from the southern town of Hengchun, came on the second anniversary of the tsunami that killed more than 200,000 lives in southern Asia.

Tuesday's tremor was felt throughout Taiwan. It shook buildings and knocked objects off the shelves in the capital, Taipei, in the northern part of the island.

Two members of one family were killed in Hengchun when their four-story home collapsed. The quake injured 42 people, three homes collapsed and 12 fires broke out, the National Fire Agency said.

Quakes frequently shake Taiwan, which is part of the Pacific's ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of volcanos and fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin. Most are minor and cause little or no damage. However, a 7.6-magnitude earthquake in central Taiwan in September 1999 killed more than 2,300 people.","The article ""Quake Knocks Out Asian Phone, Internet"" discusses the impact of a powerful earthquake off the southern tip of Taiwan that damaged undersea cables.

It directly mentions ""undersea cables"" and describes how their damage led to significant disruptions in telephone and internet service across Asia and to the United States.

The article details the extent of the disruption, indicating that 50% to 60% of Chunghwa's overall telephone capacity was cut off, and emphasizes the implications for connectivity in various regions.

Thus, the article treats the topic of cut sea cables as a central theme rather than a minor mention."

The ship according report, was loaded with fibre optic cables in Cape Town harbour and set off to the coastal waters of Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire on Tuesday evening. Its estimated arrival time in Abidjan is 06:00 on Friday, 29 March 2024. The ship is equipped with general cable works tools and a remotely operated vehicle for detecting, cutting, recovering, jointing and testing undersea fibre cables. It can handle repairs in waters as shallow as 10 meters and as deep as 7 km.

A second ship, Global Marine’s CS Sovereign, is also expected to attend to the cable breaks, but it is still moored in Portland, England, as of 08:15 on Wednesday, 20 March 2024.

On Thursday, 14 March 2024, four submarine telecommunications cables connecting African countries to Europe and other parts of the world went offline around 12:30. The cables that broke were the West Africa Cable System (WACS), Africa Coast to Europe (ACE), MainOne, and SAT–3 cables. Earlier breaks on the Seacom, EIG, and AAE–1 cables suspected to have been caused by Houthi terrorists sinking a fertilizer ship in the Red Sea in late February have also led to lowered capacity on the east coast of Africa.

The cause of the cable breaks remains to be confirmed, but preliminary analysis by submarine fibre cable operator MainOne indicates that seismic activity on the seabed caused its submarine fibre cable to break. MainOne said that the distance from land and the cable depth of about 3 km at the point of the fault ruled out any kind of human activity, including damage from ship anchors, fishing, drilling, or sabotage.

Whether you see this as promoting Russia as a bogeyman, or a real possibility, the reality is that history has demonstrated that undersea Internet cables can be cut, and that it wreaks havoc.

In fact, in early 2008 there were a rash of undersea cables being severed. In all, five cables were cut, in disparate locations, leading to many being certain that it was a concerted effort, and not coincident accidents.

All told, more than 80 million people in several countries were taken offline as four undersea cables servicing India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Egypt, Iran, and Qatar were severed, with a fifth cable sever cutting off Iran the following day.

Several months later, in December of 2008, three undersea Internet cables were severed, leading to an Internet outage affecting, among others, Egypt, Syria, Pakistan, Qatar, India, Taiwan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Djibouti, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Malaysia, the Maldives, Yemen, and Zambia.

So, cable severing is nothing new. It’s also not to be taken lightly.

As Rear Admiral Frederick Roegge, Commander of the Navy’s sub fleet in the Pacific, told the New York Times in an interview this week, “I’m worried every day about what the Russians may be doing.” (The Times says that Roegge “would not comment about possible Russian plans for cutting the undersea cables”.)

Again, the concern of a security threat in the form of undersea Internet cables being intentionally cut is nothing new.

In 2012, Michael Sechrist, an expert formerly with MIT’s Explorations in Cyber International Relations (ECIR), and now Vice President for Threat and Risk Management with the State Street Corporation, released a report on the vulnerabilities of undersea comm cables, through the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government.

The report, New Threats, Old Technology: Vulnerabilities in Undersea Communications Cable Network Management Systems, points out that “Poor physical security of cable landing sites is a potential Achilles heel for U.S. and global cyber security. Cable landing sites have always been and continue to be single points of potentially catastrophic attack and failure that must be addressed. Today, however, risk to global safety and security is compounded by the vulnerability of cable systems to cyber attacks through new network management systems.”

“The risk here is that any country could cause damage to the system and do it in a way that is completely covert,” Sechrist told the Times, adding that they could do it without even having a ship with cable-cutting equipment in the area.

That said, not everybody thinks that it is likely.

Keir Giles, an associate fellow with the Russia and Eurasia Programme at British think tank Chatham House told the BBC that “I very much doubt that anyone would think of cutting off the US. It is only going to work in locations where the internet geography is going to create a vulnerability in communications,” adding that to truly cut off the U.S. would be nearly impossible owing to the vast number of Internet connections leading to and from the United States.

“You’d need a lot of submarines to actually harm a country like the United States,” Keith Schofield, of the International Cable Protection Committee, told NPR.

Still, as Sechrist points out in his paper, more than a decade ago then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice observed that “The cyber economy is the economy. Corrupt those networks and you disrupt this nation.”","The article titled ""Why the U.S. is Concerned about Russian Submarine Activity near Undersea Internet Cables"" directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables.

It discusses the potential threat posed by Russian submarines to undersea cables, specifically mentioning that these cables can be severed, which would severely impact U.S. internet operations.

The article references historical incidents, such as the cutting of five undersea cables in 2008, which resulted in widespread internet outages affecting millions.

This context illustrates not only the risks associated with undersea cables but also their critical role in global internet connectivity.

The inclusion of expert opinions on the vulnerabilities of these cables further emphasizes the article's focus on the topic.

Overall, the article treats cut sea cables as a central theme rather than a minor mention."

Pacific Crossing, a subsidiary of the Japanese telecom giant, NTT, reported on its website that its PC-1 West undersea cable, connecting the southern Japanese city of Shima with Ajigaura, 136 kilometers north of Tokyo, was severed.

Pacific Cable's PC-1 North cable, which runs from Ajigaura to Harbour Pointe near Seattle on the United States West Coast, was also severed.

**Vulnerable bottlenecks**

Many Japanese have turned to Twitter for information about the quake.

While it may often seem like the Internet is a vast, borderless network, in reality it relies on a series of fiber optic cables that are encased to protect against earthquakes, shipping traffic, and marine life.

Sometimes damaged cables, particularly at certain bottlenecks, can lead to service outages in some parts of the world. Most recently in Asia, the December 2006 earthquake in Taiwan disrupted Internet service across the region for several weeks.

""We are trying to restore capacity right now,"" said Koji Kimura, a Pacific Crossing spokesperson, in an interview with Deutsche Welle. ""[Those cables] are no longer in use, but unfortunately the cable was physically cut due to the tsunami wave - half of our capacity is down.""

The company also has an additional cable that runs down the west coast of the United States, from Harbour Pointe, to Grover Beach in California, which is known as PC-1 East, and an additional cable that runs from California back to southern Japan, known as PC-1 South.

Kimura said the diversion had not affected most customers' level of service on the whole.

In a statement, the company said it expected its northern and western cables to be repaired by March 29 and April 19 respectively.

However, this schedule could yet be ""subject to change due to radiation levels"" at the Fukushima plant in the area of the company's cable faults.

**Further damage**

Another Japanese telecom company, KDDI, the country's second-largest telecom provider, also reported that the Japan-US cable, a major undersea cable connecting Shima with California had been damaged.

""That cable was broken but we have another backup cable so that we are still providing services continuously,"" said Satoru Ito, a KDDI spokesperson, in an interview with Deutsche Welle.

The company said it would send out a ship with diving robots to repair the cable. However, that could take months, Ito said, as the company does not yet know exactly where the damage occurred.

KDDI is currently partially re-routing some of its traffic through the Russia-Japan cable network, which connects Japan's western coast with a Russian landing station outside of Vladivostok, just north of Japan.

""There is no difference between this backup cable and the one we were using usually, there is no [difference] to the customers,"" Ito said.

Taiwan's leading telecom operator, Chunghwa Telecom, also confirmed that the Japan-US and the APCN-2 cable were damaged. The latter cable connects Japan, China, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines.

Chen Hui-yen, a company manager, told the Agence France Presse on Wednesday that company bandwidth capacity had been reduced by 30 percent, noting that it could take over a month to repair the rupture.

""There were impacts, but they were limited,"" she said. ""As of now we have received few complaints from customers.""

Telecom industry experts are impressed with the Japanese network's resilience.

**Amazon's Japan data center unaffected**

Telecom industry analysts said it was still too early to say how badly the region's undersea cables were damaged.

""My colleagues are in the process to analyze the situation in Japan after the massive earthquake and subsequent tsunami in the areas interested,"" wrote Cristina Bardelli, a spokesperson with the German telecom industry analysis firm InfoCom, in an e-mail sent to Deutsche Welle.

She added that in the immediate aftermath of the quake, mobile phone service in eastern Japan was either overloaded or damaged, but that overall, Japan's telecom companies were able to respond ""very quickly."" She said Japan's infrastructure was ""very stable,"" composed of ""good technology"" and of ""strong quality.""

""As far as we can judge, the fixed infrastructure was less damaged than the mobile one,"" she said, adding that it was not yet possible to provide percentage figures of the extent of the damage as ""the information from the Japanese side is very careful.""

""But connection to the Internet appeared virtually unaffected. Amazon Web services had just opened a data center, which apparently is running normally. We have information that some carriers providing broadband access have open their networks, for instance Softbank, and people can connect to the internet through WiFi hotspot free of charge.""

Last Friday (March 11), James Cowie, the CTO of the American Internet analysis firm Renesys, posted on a company blog that Japanese Internet connectivity had ""survived this event better than anyone would have expected.""

""The engineers who built Japan's Internet created a dense web of domestic and international connectivity that is among the richest and most diverse on earth, as befits a critical gateway for global connectivity in and out of East Asia,"" he wrote.

**Author:** Bloomberg  
**Published Date:** 05/24/2019  
  
For decades, ships owned by French phone carrier Orange SA have traveled the world’s oceans, installing and fixing the undersea cables that carry internet traffic from one continent to another.  
  
The fleet of six run by Orange Marine is now looking to diversify, even with the biggest investment boom for the infrastructure since the 1990s. Instead of creating more business, the new high-capacity lines being financed by the tech giants are expected to put older cables out of service, meaning less work for the seaborne repairmen.  
  
One cable that started up last year highlights the issue. The line, running from the U.S. state of Virginia to Sopelana, Spain, accounts for half the capacity of the dozen or so trans-Atlantic cables. Known as Marea, the 6,600-kilometer (4,101-mile) link owned by Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Telefonica SA’s Telxius offers the fastest data transmission speeds in the world.  
  
Jean-Luc Vuillemin, who oversees Orange Marine, sees potential opportunities in servicing offshore wind turbines. “The ecosystem is pretty favorable right now but this may change in the future,” Vuillemin said. “You need to diversify when the business is in order, so we’re thinking about the next steps.”  
  
**Strategic Asset**  
Orange Marine is a small yet profitable business for France’s dominant phone carrier, generating about 100 million euros ($112 million) of annual sales out of Orange’s roughly 41 billion euros of revenue. But it’s considered a strategic asset by the company, whose largest shareholder is the French state.  
  
Being able to quickly repair cables can be crucial in an emergency, as Algeria experienced in 2015 when a link between Annaba in the country’s northeast and Marseille in southern France was cut by an anchor, disrupting internet service in the North African nation for almost a week.  
  
Together, Orange Marine and its France-based competitor at Nokia Oyj, Alcatel Submarine Networks, own about one-quarter of the 40 or so ships focused on subsea cables globally.  
“Our Western economies are increasingly dependent on these subsea cables. Orange Marine provides strategic autonomy. It’s a matter of sovereignty.”

Things at the bottom of the sea: pale fish, manganese nodules, plastic trash and cables. Lots of cables.

In our wireless, satellite-broadcasted world, it's easy to forget that most of our electronic communications still run through wires. This includes the vast majority of international calls, text messages and Internet transmissions, which must be ferried through cables that stretch across continents at the bottom of the ocean.

These undersea cables are easy to forget, since they are well out of sight and mind. But without them, the world as we know it would cease to exist, and their history is fascinating, says Nicole Starosielski, an assistant professor of media, culture and communication at New York University. Starosielski first looked into the topic while in grad school at U.C. Santa Barbara, at her adviser's behest; she thought it would be boring, but she instead found herself enthralled, and ended up writing one of the first books on the topic called *The Undersea Network*.

**What is something most people don't know about undersea cables?**

Most people probably don't know that 99 percent of all transoceanic data traffic goes through undersea cables, and that includes Internet usage, phone calls and text messages. This route is also faster than satellite transmissions, by up to eight-fold.

**Can these communications on these cables be tapped into or intercepted?**

They have been in the past. In something called Operation Ivy Bells, the U.S. tapped Russian undersea cables during the Cold War. There's also concern this could be or is happening now, according to NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden's revelations.

**When were these things installed?**

The first transatlantic cable was laid in 1860s, and these kind of telegraph cables lasted for 60 to 70 years or even longer underwater; they were extremely durable. In the 1950s they were basically replaced by telephone cables. And then starting in the 1980s these were swapped with fiber optic cables, which carry information at the speed of light.

**What has been the most catastrophic failure in the history of undersea cables?**

In 2006 there was a magnitude 7.0 earthquake off Taiwan that severed eight cables in multiple places, disrupting much of the Internet traffic to and from China. It took 11 cable ships a total of 49 days to complete the repairs.

There were also a series of breakages off the coast of Egypt in 2008, affecting 60 million users in India, 12 million users in Pakistan, 6 million in Egypt, and 4.7 million in Saudi Arabia. There's a theory that these cuts were made intentionally as an act of sabotage or terrorism.

**How are breakages avoided?**

There are now pretty detailed maps of the areas where the cables are laid, so cablemen can avoid hazards like undersea mountains. The biggest problem has always been people dropping anchors or trawl nets, and this still happens all the time—there is a cable break about every three days. Near shore cables are buried below the seafloor to avoid this.

**How are the cables repaired?**

It's actually not that difficult. The cable company contracts a ship to go to the exact spot where the break is. You lower down a grapnel, which is like a big shovel, and pull up each side of the cable and buoy them. Then you splice in a new wire segment that connects each side. The problem is, there aren't many of these ships. When a lot of breaks happen all at once, there may not be enough ships to go around.

**What are some other interesting facts you came across in your research?**

In the telegraph era, British companies would lay undersea cables in China in the middle of the night because the government didn't approve of them, and this allowed them to send communications in and out of the country.

Throughout history, cables have occasionally been damaging to the environment, but that isn't necessarily the case anymore. In fact, some work shows the ""cable protection zones,"" where shipping is disallowed to avoid cable breakages from trawling or anchor-drops, can actually increase fish populations.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, including their significance in international data transport.

The fault means users are only getting slow connections to overseas websites. Webpages are displaying slowly, while IM (instant messaging) messages are often slow to go through or are dropped altogether.

Quoting Malaysian telecom operator TM, ZDNet Asia said that the fault appears to be off the coast of China.

> According to a notice sent by Malaysian telco, TM Net, the cable fault was traced to segment 7 of the APCN2, which stretches between Shantou, China and Tanshui, Taiwan. TM Net traced the outage to Typhoon Morakot, which hit the region over the weekend.

> Additionally, segment 1 of the APCN2 is also currently under repair. Repairs on segment 7 are expected to commence after work on segment 1 is completed.

Submarine cable cuts are commonly affected by typhoons and earthquakes. During the [Asian telecom blackout](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/28/business/worldbusiness/28quake.html) of December 2006, communications in the region came to standstill after a quake in Taiwan damaged several cable systems at one go, leaving few backup options for telcos.

Submarine cables are also prone to damage from ships. Following the routes of global commerce, the cables are usually laid along busy shipping lanes, where vessels are known to accidentally break the cables while dropping anchor.

Just last month, TM said [APCN2 suffered a cut](http://www.tm.com.my/announcement/2009/050809.asp) in the segment between Kuantan and Katong, Singapore, slowing down the access of many Malaysian users.

The only time the world is even aware of the undersea cables that carry internet signals around the world is when they are cut off - such as when a cable connecting Europe to the Middle East failed last year, or when a trailing ship's anchor cut through a cable under the Indian ocean.

Now, a new interactive map from Telegeography should help ships to steer clear of the multi-billion-dollar network of high-power cables through which 99 per cent of global internet traffic travels.  

Broadband under the sea: The cables that connect the continents

The map - using info from the Global Bandwidth Research Service - shows the position of cables (both planned ones and ones currently on the sea bed), and lets you know their landing stations, who owns them, how long they are, and when they'll come into operation if they are not already. The version on Telegeography's site lets you click on any cable to find out more.  

Tim Stronge, of Telegeography, who created the map, says, 'Submarine cables are very expensive to build (generally ranging from $100m - $500m) but they deliver a huge amount of capacity.'  

'Some of the older cables deliver only 20 Gbps - most of the new ones can deliver several terabits (terabit = 1,000 gigabit) of capacity,' says Stronge - home internet connections are typically between one and 50 megabits per second (a megabit being 1/1000th of a gigabit.  

The Apollo cable - hidden under a Cornish beach - is one of Britain's main connections to America

'Each cable costs about $10m a year in maintenance costs -- the price operators have to pay to keep repair ships on standby, and other costs. If a cable breaks (which happens surprisingly frequently), the owner(s) of the cable also have to pay a repair ship to go out to sea and splice the cable, to the tune of $10,000 per day.'  

The cables themselves are often not much wider than garden hoses and contain fibre-optic lines which can each contain bandwidth for up to 20 million people.

New cables such as Apollo offer speeds in 'terabits' per second - each terabit is 1,000 gigabits, in turn 1,000 megabits. Home connections are often as slow one megabit.

One cable between the US and the UK carries 3.2 terabits of data per second - the 7,600 mile journey takes 0.00072 seconds.

Data on newer, hi-tech internet cables is 'flashed' down the lines by high-powered lasers, and the intensity is maintained by electrical repeaters costing up to £1 million each. An electrical cable runs parallel to the fibre-optic line to power the repeaters.  

Failures can be catastrophic. One cable failure - between Sicily and Egypt - left more than 50 per cent of India without power in 2008, sending the country's computer industry and stock markets offline for hours.","The article discusses undersea cables, including specific incidents where cables were cut and the consequences of those cuts on internet connectivity.

It mentions examples such as a cable failure connecting Europe to the Middle East and an incident involving a ship's anchor cutting a cable in the Indian Ocean.

Additionally, it highlights the significant implications of cable failures, including a catastrophic incident in 2008 that affected a large portion of India's internet access.

These elements demonstrate that the article treats the topic of cut sea cables as a central theme rather than a minor mention."

This is an essential resource for global business, as it allows the Internet to reach all corners of the planet, since wireless technology and satellite connections don’t have the same reliability and speed in data transmission. This improved performance is fostering the continuous spread of cables with private and public capital.

Humanity’s interest in being connected via submarine cable dates back to 1852, when a telecommunications network was laid between Great Britain and France through the English Channel to connect both countries to the telegraph network. It took another two years for the first transoceanic installation, thanks to Atlantic Telegraph Company, which placed a cable for telegraphic transmission between the Canadian island of Newfoundland and Ireland. Nevertheless, technical problems delayed the first stable transatlantic connection until 1866, and it was not until 1956 that a telephone line was installed.

Another milestone in the story was the appearance of fiber optics. According to Mariano Martínez and Noelia Miranda, member of the Board of Directors and head of Technical Development and Training at the Official Association of Telecommunications Engineers (COIT), respectively, modern submarine cables are made of optical fiber and based on the properties of pure fiberglass where light travels via internal reflection. “Due to light losing intensity throughout the cable, boosters are required at regular intervals to reestablish the intensity of the optical signal,” they said.

One of the greatest technical concerns is material durability in such an aggressive environment as the one underwater; cables are usually expected to last an average of 25 years. In order to ensure durability, the optical fibers are protected with a series of concentric layers that safeguard the interior. These layers are made of copper and polyethylene. They also have steel protection to be able to provide mechanical traction and resistance on the seabed. In the event that the cables are responsible for transporting electricity, they are also inserted in a special pipe to prevent the risk of contact with water.

In any case, once the source and destination of the cables have been defined, a bathymetric survey is carried out to design the route it will go through, i.e., “a 3D analysis of the ocean floor to determine the least turbulent path where the cable is least likely to be damaged.”

Cable security
--------------

Nevertheless, the ocean floor is not a flat surface, but rather a turbulent one with depressions, rocks, mountains, etc. That’s why fishing areas and faults are avoided when planning the cable’s final path and, wherever possible, boats unroll the cable over sandy floors instead of rocky ones. Other issues can arise from fishing boat and shipping accidents as well as the use of anchors. As Martínez and Miranda pointed out, sometimes the cables are even damaged by shark bites.

They must also be prepared for earthquakes. One occurring near Taiwan in 2006 (7.0 magnitude) broke eight cables and seriously affected communications in China. Today, movement sensors are placed on the ocean floor so that if the tremors begin there, the speed with which the cable can give a warning provides a great deal of leeway to anticipate situations in cities.

> There are 378 submarine cables laid around the world, with a total length of 1.2 million kilometers

There are mechanisms to monitor the submarine cables and prevent the deteriorations caused by the fishing and shipping industries. The landing point (where the submarine cable makes landfall) plays a decisive role in guaranteeing proper functioning of the service in security protocols. The landing point, which works in conjunction with the Network Operations Center, has a series of technological tools to monitor the entire system in real time.

If the cable is damaged, repairs are done on the surface. “The damaged ends are retrieved by a submarine robot and the damage is then repaired, connected, or resolved on board special ships,” highlighted the COIT engineers.

In addition to the physical security of the cable, there are three international treaties that legally protect these lines. The most important laws notably include the freedom to lay, maintain, and repair submarine cables up to 12 nautical miles outside territorial waters and the national obligation to impose criminal and civil penalties on anyone who intentionally or negligently damages a cable.

International cooperation
-------------------------

Submarine cables mostly belong to large telecommunications firms. Some state and government-owned companies also have stakes in them and there are so-called consortium cables, which are the product of agreements between several companies such as Microsoft, Facebook, and Google.

There are several international projects. Google announced its intention to finance three new submarine cables that will connect five regions of the world. Next year, it will finance three submarine cable projects: Curie, a private cable that will connect Chile and Los Angeles; Havfrue, a consortium aiming to connect the US to Denmark and Ireland; and the Hong-Kong-Guam cable system, another consortium that will connect different underground communications centers throughout Asia.

The installation of the first cable to directly connect Europe and South America is very significant, since up until now cables have gone to the United States and then connected to South America from there. The European Commission will provide 26.5 million euros, making it the largest investor in the Bella project – driven by a public-private partnership – which will involve laying 10,000 kilometers of cable under the Atlantic between Alentejo, Portugal, and Fortaleza, Brazil.

In Spain, most submarine cables start in the south, but another cable was recently rolled out in the north: Marea, a project driven by Telxius, Facebook, and Microsoft to connect Virginia Beach (east coast of the United States), where the largest concentration of data centers in the world is located, to Sopelana (Bizkaia) “thereby allowing two people separated by the Atlantic Ocean to communicate in less than one second.”

> 99% of transoceanic communications are done via submarine cables, which achieve speeds up to eight times faster than the satellite network

Future expansion
----------------

The great deal of interest from private companies and public institutions in these cables originates from the increase in connectivity across the planet. There are currently approximately 378 submarine cables laid around the world, with a total length of 1.2 million kilometers. The speed of development will increase in the short term. According to a Telegraphy report commissioned by DE-CIX, in the next three years there will be up to 74 systems more than 300,000 kilometers long, which are expected to have an estimated 8.8 billion dollar investment in the top submarine routes.

Their mission is fundamental since, according to Noelia Miranda and Mariano Martínez, although communications satellites cover part of the communications demand (especially for television and Internet), fiber optic submarine cables are the true Internet superhighways: “99% of transoceanic communications are done in this way, achieving speeds up to eight times faster than the satellite network,” they concluded.

One factor working in their favor is that they are not affected by atmospheric phenomena such as storms and cyclones, unlike satellites, and the path they cross is considerably shorter. For instance, the distance between Tokyo and Los Angeles is approximately 9,000 kilometers and a fiber optic cable will always give data a shorter path to travel than a satellite. This path will generally be above 36,000 kilometers, while Internet data carried via satellite has to go up to the satellite and then back down, doubling the journey (more than 72,000 kilometers).

Additionally, “in the future the evolution of technological equipment will allow us to double or quadruple capacity, as has occurred since older cables,” stated the COIT experts. This is essential, as data traffic in 2024 will have increased by 24%, according to Cisco. They advocate for greater development of oceanographic observatories to improve cable technology. However, both design and operations are continually evolving and new, smaller systems with greater capacity and reliability are being developed to cover all future communications needs.

Telecommunications companies said the 6.7-magnitude earthquake forced them to activate backup systems after tens of millions of internet and telephone users were cut off from service Wednesday.

The earthquake claimed the lives of two Taiwanese residents and injured more than 40 people, and the communications breakdown also hit the island hard, as Taiwan is Asia's fifth-largest economy.

Initial tremors on Tuesday set off alerts about a possible tsunami on the second anniversary of the waves that killed about 230,000 people in Southeast Asia, but the region was spared further disaster.

Chunghwa Telecom Co., Taiwan's largest phone company, said the tremors damaged two underwater cables off the Taiwanese coast, which link communications between several Asian countries.

As a result, the company lost at least half of its telephone capacity, meaning connections have been cut off to China, Japan and other parts of Southeast Asia, company spokesman Wu Chih-ming said.

### Repairs could take weeks

The island's undersea cable system includes seven interconnected lines, in which damage to one line can affect the others.

Wu said it could take weeks of repairs until calls can be properly routed and connected, and damaged portions must first be hauled on board ships for the work to begin.

""On average, if the problems with the cables are less than 1,000 metres deep, the repair teams should only need two weeks,"" he said. ""But if it's deeper, it could take three weeks.""

Neighbouring countries, including China, Japan and South Korea, have also reported online and telephone glitches.

Your photos, uploaded to Google's cloud, do not float in the ether. Your iCloud backups do not break bread with the gods. The metaverse that Facebook is so keen on building will not exist in the heavens.

The name “cloud” is a linguistic trick – a way of hiding who controls the underlying technology of the internet – and the huge power they wield. Stop to think about it for a moment and the whole notion is bizarre. The cloud is, in fact, a network of cables and servers that cover the world: once the preserve of obscure telecoms firms, it is now, increasingly, owned and controlled by Big Tech – with Google and Facebook claiming a lion’s share.

Building data centre capacity is something of a full-time job for Big Tech. Here, in vast facilities spread across the world, your most private photos and messages sit on a hard drive on an anonymous computer on an anonymous rack, stacked alongside thousands of others in an out-of-town data centre, sited somewhere where energy and land are cheap.

The cloud is a hulking physical network. It forms a part of the internet’s backbone, which itself is overwhelmingly made up of a network of cables intersecting the world’s oceans. It is easy to imagine these as larger or grander than they are – in reality they are generally the width of a hosepipe, buried for a short distance from shore for security, but beyond that point allowed to sit freely on the sea bed.

A conversation with Bruce Neilson-Watts, who spent 16 years as a navigator, engineer and then a captain of boats working to lay and repair the cables, sheds a little more light on what they look like and how they work. The actual part of the cable which carries information across the continent is just the tiniest core of the hosepipe-width cable, with even that tiny thickness able to carry up to 100GBps or even 400GBps on newer cables in the smallest fractions of a second.

Much of the rest of the width is made up of petroleum jelly – yes, the same stuff that comes in a Vaseline jar – intended to protect the cables from water damage and corrosion, meaning even the physical structure of the internet is, in fact, lubed up. Make of that what you will.

The ownership of the data centres – and often as a result, our data – that power the internet is a matter of almost constant public debate. It’s the issue that drives conversations about tech monopolies and the overbearing power of internet platforms. But the same cannot be said of those transatlantic cables, almost 1.5 million kilometres of which now traverse almost every part of the globe.

These operators tend to stay out of sight. In reality, many of the world’s international cables are often owned by consortia of companies, who are often rivals in other contexts. Some major internet cables list as many as 50 owners, while only around a quarter appear to be operated by one company.

These companies charge others for the amount of data they transmit through the cables they own, but also barter access to cables owned by others in exchange for free access to theirs – a quiet share-and-share-alike system behind huge telecoms companies, all behind the scenes.

The world’s biggest owner of cables is a household name, at least to Americans – it’s AT&T, which has a stake in around 230,000 kilometres of international internet cabling, or around one sixth of the total. But looking at others in the top ten reveals why both Big Tech and Western governments are starting to pay the apparently dull issue of cable ownership more attention: in second place is China Telecom, while Chunghwa Telecom (based in Taiwan) is third and China Unicorn is sixth.

In the tenth and eleventh spots, however, are some very familiar names: Facebook and Google. Big Tech is getting into big cables – and doing so in a big way. Over the past few years, 80 percent of investment in new cables has flowed from the two US tech giants. As of today, Facebook owns or co-owns 99,399 kilometres of cables, Google 95,876 kilometres. And more investments are on their way: in August, Facebook and Google announced their plans for building a 12,000 kilometre undersea cable, Apricot, which will link Singapore, Japan, Guam, the Philippines, Taiwan and Indonesia when completed in 2024. For Google, that came hot on the heels of a previous announcement about the Echo subsea cable, which will connect California, Singapore, Guam and Indonesia. For its part, Facebook has thrown its weight behind the coalition of telcos building what might turn out to be the longest subsea cable ever: 2Africa, a 45,000 kilometre-long cord planned to encompass the whole African continent and connect 33 countries in Africa, Europe and the Middle-East by 2024. In May 2020 Bloomberg reported that the project will cost under $1 billion – but that was before Facebook announced several expansions to the initial design.

The stated motivations for these efforts vary. Facebook especially frames part of its effort as being about improving internet access across the world – while admitting some advantage to itself through user growth if this succeeds. Google mostly highlights how greater connectivity will boost local economic prosperity.

Many internet cables follow the telecoms routes laid out in the early twentieth century, and so efforts to build huge new cables serving non-western countries (like, in a way, the 2Africa cable) are framed as an effort to decolonise the internet, albeit an uncomfortable one given the mix of companies and groups involved.

The tech giants have privacy and security reasons to get into cables, too. In 2013, when The Guardian and The Washington Post published revelations from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, the story that most angered American tech firms (especially Google) was about how the agency was intercepting traffic sent internally between their data centres.

Google’s response to this was both to ratchet up its use of encryption, even for traffic travelling internally (which can still mean across continents), and to increase its reliance on entirely private fibre-optic cables for such communications. And when you think like Google and the other tech giants, once you’re in the cable game, you might as well get in properly.

Tom Wheeler, the former chairman of the USA’s Federal Communications Commission under president Obama – and self-avowed former lobbyist for the cable industry – says that Big Tech’s foray into cable-laying has also affected cable companies’ thinking. “The networks themselves are wildly jealous of, and therefore, are trying to assimilate into [Big Tech],” he says. Seeing Big Tech take a huge slice of the profit from the internet as platforms, many cable companies want to be platforms too, he explains. “Why did AT&T buy DirecTV? Why did they buy Time Warner, et cetera? They want to get into these platform activities.”

Where cable companies are realising they are missing out on power by missing out on being platforms, Big Tech platforms are making the opposite realisation: unless they have some sway in distribution, their power will be limited. And the Big Tech companies seem to be managing to buy up stakes in the internet’s backbone much more competently and quietly than their cable counterparts have managed the reverse (just think of the unhappy, short-lived takeover of AOL by Verizon.)

The list of stakeholders in the internet backbone shows who is trying to seize outright control of the internet. And, once again, it looks like the usual suspects have the tightest grip.","The article titled ""Facebook and Google’s New Plan?

**In short:**  
The Danish military is staying close to a Chinese ship in its waters after two underwater telecommunication cables were cut.  
Some European countries say it was likely an act of sabotage and investigations into the incident have started.  
Russia has strongly denied any suggestions it was behind the severed cables.  

The Danish military is monitoring a Chinese ship in its waters just days after two underwater telecommunication cables were cut in a possible act of sabotage, according to local authorities.  
European governments accused Russia on Tuesday of escalating hybrid attacks on Ukraine's Western allies.  
But, the Kremlin has strongly dismissed suggestions it was involved in the damage caused to the telecommunications cables in the Baltic Sea as ""absurd"".  

**Undersea cables severed:**  
The fibre-optic data cable between Sweden and Lithuania was damaged on Sunday, while the other cable which runs between Finland and Germany was damaged on Monday.  
This happened in Sweden's exclusive economic zone and Swedish prosecutors have started a preliminary investigation on suspicion of possible sabotage.  

German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said Russia poses not just a military but also a hybrid threat and Europe needs to take a broad approach to defence.  
He added that the damage to the two cables was ""a very clear sign that something is afoot.""  

**Russia denies involvement:**  
European officials stopped short of directly accusing Russia of destroying the cables.  
Germany, Poland and others have said it was likely an act of sabotage, Russia criticised any suggestions it was involved in the severed cables incidents.  
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday ""it is quite absurd to continue to blame Russia for everything without any reason.""  

**Why is a Chinese ship being closely watched?**  
The Chinese bulk carrier Yi Peng 3 was anchored in the Kattegat strait between Denmark and Sweden on Wednesday, according to tracking data from a Danish navy patrol ship.  
Traffic data showed the Chinese ship left the Russian port of Ust-Luga on November 15 and was in the areas where the cable damages occurred, but other ships had also been in the areas.  
A Chinese government spokesperson said it always required its vessels to abide by relevant laws and regulations.

With the recent wave of concern over Russian subs and spy ships encroaching on undersea data cables, Americans have become all too aware that the seemingly intangible data stored up in the ""cloud"" isn't nebulous at all. Rather, the mechanics of the internet are solid, taking form in cables that snake across the ocean floor.

Though this may seem like a Cold War scare, the fears are new, report David E. Sanger and Eric Schmitt for _The New York Times_. Cutting the cables in the right places would sever the data lifeline of the West. The cables are so vulnerable that last year shark bites even prompted Google to reinforce their network.

Amidst these tensions nags a different question: How does the internet actually work?

In a new video, Phil Edwards and Gina Barton of _Vox_ explore the network of thin, fiberoptic cables that distribute 99 percent of international data. ""If you held one in your hand, it’d be no bigger than a soda can,"" Edwards says in the video.

Thin underwater cables hold the internet. See a map of them all.

Submarine cables aren’t exactly new, but they are a big deal in the modern world. While satellites are needed to beam the Internet to some places, like remote research bases in Antarctica, cables on the seafloor are more reliable, redundant (good for backup in the case of damage) and fast.

Tech companies and various countries are even investing in their own routes and connections. The telecommunications marketing researcher and consulting group TeleGeography reports that in 2015, 299 cable systems are ""active, under construction or expected to be fully-funded by the end of 2015.""

In honor of all those cables, TeleGeography created a vintage-inspired map, which is well worth a gander. The map includes the latency, or the milliseconds of delay a ping takes to travel, from the U.S., U.K., Hong Kong and several other countries.

So how did the more than 550,000 miles of cables get down there? Edwards explains at _Vox_:

> The process for laying submarine cables hasn't changed much in 150 years—a ship traverses the ocean, slowly unspooling cable that sinks to the ocean floor. The _SS Great Eastern_ laid the first continually successful trans-Atlantic cable in 1866, which was used to transmit telegraphs. Later cables (starting in 1956) carried telephone signals.

The internet is also wired through cables that crisscross countries and someday in the future it might exist in hundreds of tiny satellites. But for now, it’s on the ocean floor.","The article ""Forget the Hazy Clouds—The Internet is in the Ocean"" discusses the critical infrastructure of the internet, specifically focusing on undersea cables.

It mentions the vulnerability of these cables in the context of geopolitical tensions, stating that cutting them could sever the data lifeline of the West.

Direct references to ""undersea data cables"" and ""submarine cables"" are made, emphasizing their importance for internet connectivity.

Last Wednesday, in the worldwide puppetry show called internet, a string had snapped. The Western world, with banks and factories and telephone networks to run, had just lost connection with its housekeeper and doorman, India. There was only one thing at stake: global business.

The potential danger from the two breaks in undersea cables in the Mediterranean was immense. Western businesses and customers depend on global connectivity to outsourced service providers such as India to run their daily affairs.

A disruption could have stranded them in a virtual no-man’s-land and India could have lost credibility as an always-on supplier of an ever-growing variety of services. Except that none of this happened. India and world can thank the design of the internet, Hydra-headed as it is, to this happy turn of events. Within a few milliseconds, life was back to normal, almost.

It was not by coincidence that the breakdown in SEA-ME-WE (South East Asia, Middle East, Western Europe) and FLAG (Fibre-optic Link Around the Globe) cables that carry the bulk of data and voice traffic from India to the West left only a limited impact for businesses. It was the combined effort of a dynamic disaster recovery technology and quick intervention by machine and humans that averted a catastrophe.

“In a way, this cable break showed how robust internet is, because data traffic got rerouted dynamically and there was not more than a delay of 60 milliseconds,” says Sify technology vice-president PK Saji. “With such a cut in the traditional switched network, you would have got cut off totally.”

Most of the connectivity among nations is through optic fibre cables laid under the sea. Satellites cannot match their capacity and land cables can only go so far. Undersea cables connect continents and some of them are nearly as long as the Earth’s circumference. For instance, SEA-ME-WE 3 is one-inch thick and 39,000 kilometres long. Ten such cables can stretch all the way to the Moon.

Ten years ago, the whole of India had only 1 gigabits per second (gbps) of international connectivity through these cables. That was what 500 high-speed internet users in the United States enjoyed. This tenuous link was virtually meaningless to large companies trying to provide outsourcing services online to the rest of the world. Just one bottleneck would’ve cut off the country. So, those who could, bought their own connections and others waited on the fringes.

As private players entered the internet service provider business and as the country entered the new millennium, capacity started growing rapidly. Today, India has 18 terabits (tbps), that is 18,000 times the bandwidth that it had a decade ago. In addition, there are a number of privately accessed cables that go out of the Indian coast.

The major cables that knot India in the global web are SEA-ME-WE 3 and 4, FLAG, i2i (India to Island) and TIC (Tata Indicom Cable). Smaller, but important, systems are FALCON (FLAG Alcatel-Lucent Optical Network) to Saudi Arabia used by Reliance group and Bharat-Lanka Cable System to Colombo used by Bharat Sanchar Nigam. Hundreds of such cable systems criss-crossing the seabed form a mesh of bandwidth around the world.

Internet data is split into small capsules called packets, each of which can travel separately but be regrouped with others at the endpoint. If there is a cut in one of these wires, data packets can bounce off those lines and travel through other lines. In switched networks like traditional long-distance telephony, this is not possible.

“IP (Internet Protocol) networks are the new generation technology to route any traffic through any route, any time. But for this resilience, the system would have collapsed with such a cable problem,” says Internet Service Providers Association of India president Rajesh Chharia. For high-value customers such as outsourcing companies, the rerouting gets done automatically by the systems at the ISP’s hub.

For instance, at Sify’s control room in Chennai, the computers poll the global cable network, on land and under water, every 30 seconds. “It can be a powercut in Kashmir or a cable break in the Mediterranean. It takes a maximum of 30 seconds for the traffic to go on another line, say, through Singapore,” says Saji.

The hero of the last week’s cable break incident, at least for India, was i2i, which links Mumbai with Singapore via Chennai. It has an operational capacity of about 160 gbps, but can light up to a whopping 8.5 tbps. It took a bulk of the rerouted load and essentially served as the alternative route to the US and Europe.

The twin cable breaks in the Mediterranean robbed India of about 1.4 terabits of bandwidth. This was less than 10% of what India could tap from its existing connections. Compare this with a similar cable break in December 2006, when an earthquake in Taiwan region, cut of 20 tbps. That time, thankfully, it was on the eastern side and the India’s traffic towards the US and Europe was not affected.

The real sufferers during cable breaks are the individual internet users. Their connectivity is low priority for many ISPs who derive much of their profits from companies. The benefits of dynamic rerouting don’t come free. Large users pay a premium fee to make sure cable cuts don’t stop their traffic. For the small guy, a cable break could lead to disconnection or sluggish download speeds. Despite ISP claims, the small guy took a big knock during last week’s problems.

Internet industry experts say the incident has shown that it is far too risky for a company to have its own line under the sea or subscribe to just one connection. Contrary to the sophisticated image of global networks, the world communicates through a small number of bottlenecks and a snap could mean trillions of dollars in losses.

“I expect this incident to teach a lesson to our ISPs. They will all now rush to book capacity on other lines such as i2i. This will spur demand for the Pacific side cables,” Chharia says. “At the end of it, it was a close shave for India. When the whole world is looking to India, we couldn’t have let this shake our reliability.”","The article titled ""Hydra-headed nature helps Net rebound after cable cut"" directly discusses the implications of undersea cable cuts, specifically two breaks in cables in the Mediterranean.

It mentions ""undersea cables"" and ""cable breaks"" and explores the potential crisis these cuts could cause for global businesses relying on connectivity with India.

The article highlights how the disruptions affected bandwidth, noting that India lost about 1.4 terabits of bandwidth due to the breaks, but emphasizes the resilience of the internet infrastructure that allowed for quick rerouting of data.

The entire narrative centers around the incident of cable cuts and their consequences, fulfilling the requirement of the criterion."

Read the [original article](https://theconversation.com/in-our-wi-fi-world-the-internet-still-depends-on-undersea-cables-49936).

Recently a [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/world/europe/russian-presence-near-undersea-cables-concerns-us.html) on Russian submarine activity near undersea communications cables dredged up Cold War politics and generated widespread recognition of the submerged systems we all depend upon.

Not many people realize that undersea cables transport nearly [100% of transoceanic data traffic](https://books.google.com/books?id=LQDXAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA362&dq=submarine+telecommunications+cables&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBGoVChMI5Pm8_oPyyAIVBG4-Ch379Al9#v=onepage&q=99&f=false). These lines are laid on the very bottom of the ocean floor. They’re about as thick as a garden hose and carry the world’s internet, phone calls and even TV transmissions between continents at the speed of light. A single cable can carry tens of terabits of information per second.

While researching my book [The Undersea Network](https://www.dukeupress.edu/The-Undersea-Network), I realized that the cables we all rely on to send everything from email to banking information across the seas remain largely unregulated and undefended. Although they are laid by only a few companies (including the American company SubCom and the French company Alcatel-Lucent) and often funneled along narrow paths, the ocean’s vastness has often provided them protection.

**Far from wireless**

The fact that we route internet traffic through the ocean – amidst deep sea creatures and hydrothermal vents – runs counter to most people’s imaginings of the internet. Didn’t we develop satellites and Wi-Fi to transmit signals through the air? Haven’t we moved to the cloud? Undersea cable systems sound like a thing of the past.

The reality is that the cloud is actually under the ocean. Even though they might seem behind the times, fiber-optic cables are actually state-of-the-art global communications technologies. Since they use light to encode information and remain unfettered by weather, cables carry data faster and cheaper than satellites. They crisscross the continents too – a message from New York to California also travels by fiber-optic cable. These systems are not going to be replaced by aerial communications anytime soon.

**A vulnerable system?**

The biggest problem with cable systems is not technological – it’s human. Because they run underground, underwater and between telephone poles, cable systems populate the same spaces we do. As a result, we accidentally break them all the time. Local construction projects dig up terrestrial lines. Boaters drop anchors on cables. And submarines can pinpoint systems under the sea.

Most of the recent media coverage has been dominated by the question of vulnerability. Are global communications networks really at risk of disruption? What would happen if these cables were cut? Do we need to worry about the threat of sabotage from Russian subs or terrorist agents?

The answer to this is not black and white. Any individual cable is always at risk, but likely far more so from boaters and fishermen than any saboteur. Over history, the single largest cause of disruption has been people [unintentionally dropping anchors and nets](https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid=1&doctype=cite&docid=35+Tul.+Mar.+L.+J.+103&srctype=smi&srcid=3B15&key=643357ed57ae3d616915cb7b77c245f4). The [International Cable Protection Committee](https://www.iscpc.org) has been working for years to prevent such breaks.

As a result, cables today are covered in steel armor and buried beneath the seafloor at their shore-ends, where the human threat is most concentrated. This provides some level of protection. In the deep sea, the ocean’s inaccessibility largely safeguards cables – they need only to be covered with a thin polyethelene sheath. It’s not that it’s much more difficult to sever cables in the deep ocean, it’s just that the primary forms of interference are less likely to happen. The sea is so big and the cables are so narrow, the probability isn’t that high that you’d run across one.

Sabotage has actually been rare in the history of undersea cables. There are certainly occurrences (though none recently), but these are disproportionately publicized. The World War I [German raid of the Fanning Island cable station in the Pacific Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanning_Raid) gets a lot of attention. And there was [speculation about sabotage](http://www.economist.com/node/10653963) in the cable disruptions outside Alexandria, Egypt in 2008, which cut 70% of the country’s internet, affecting millions. Yet we hear little about the regular faults that occur, on average, [about 200 times each year](https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid=1&doctype=cite&docid=35+Tul.+Mar.+L.+J.+103&srctype=smi&srcid=3B15&key=643357ed57ae3d616915cb7b77c245f4).

**Redundancy provides some protection**

The fact is it’s incredibly difficult to monitor these lines. Cable companies have been trying to do so for more than a century, since the first telegraph lines were laid in the 1800s. But the ocean is too vast and the lines simply too long. It would be impossible to stop every vessel that came anywhere near critical communications cables. We’d need to create extremely long, “no-go” zones across the ocean, which itself would profoundly disrupt the economy.

[Fewer than 300 cable systems](http://submarinecablemap.com) transport almost all transoceanic traffic around the world. And these often run through narrow pressure points where small disruptions can have massive impacts. Since each cable can carry an extraordinary amount of information, it’s not uncommon for an entire country to rely on only a handful of systems. In many places, it would take only a few cable cuts to take out large swathes of the internet. If the right cables were disrupted at the right time, it could disrupt global internet traffic for weeks or even months.

The thing that protects global information traffic is the fact that there’s some redundancy built into the system. Since there is more cable capacity than there is traffic, when there is a break, information is automatically rerouted along other cables. Because there are many systems linking to the United States, and a lot of internet infrastructure is located here, a single cable outage is unlikely to cause any noticeable effect for Americans.

Any single cable line has been and will continue to be susceptible to disruption. And the only way around this is to build a more diverse system. But as things are, even though individual companies each look out for their own network, there is no economic incentive or supervisory body to ensure the global system as a whole is resilient. If there’s a vulnerability to worry about, this is it.

Fresh connectivity woes appear to have struck a segment of the aging SEA-ME-WE 3 submarine cable which leads to Australia. A repair job last month to fix damage that occurred in September was not satisfactorily completed, according to The Register.

Australian Internet service provider iiNet had advised customers over the weekend to expect an increase in latency when browsing international sites due to “a submarine cable fault impacting our international links between Perth and Singapore.” The notice promised an update in a week’s time, suggesting that it is not an issue that can be quickly rectified.

It’s not the first time that SEA-ME-WE 3 has run into problems. We reported late last year on how a cable fault in the section between Singapore and Indonesia caused similar slow Internet access for iiNet users.

At 39,000km, SEA-ME-WE 3 is the longest telecoms cable in the world, spanning from Germany to Australia and Japan, with some 39 landing stations in between.

The name stands for South East Asia - Middle East - Western Europe, and the cable system itself has two fiber pairs, carrying 48 wavelengths of 10 Gbps or 480 Gbps in each direction.

Importantly, SEA-ME-WE 3 is the sole cable serving Perth from overseas at the moment. There are alternative network paths through Sydney to Hong Kong, but these introduce significant delays, increasing latency due to the circuitous route.

Errant ship anchor in shallower water and earthquakes are what typically causes damage to undersea cables. The segment of SEA-ME-WE 3 leading to Australia takes a route through Indonesia, which is a region known to experience hundreds of earthquakes every year.

For now, the Submarine Cable Map service provided by TeleGeography pointed to several submarine cables currently under construction to link up the Singapore to Perth route. However, the earliest estimated availability for service date is in late 2016, so it’s at least another year before the reliance on SEA-ME-WE 3 can be alleviated.","The article discusses the SEA-ME-WE 3 submarine cable, detailing connectivity issues caused by damage to the cable.

Many internet users have complained of slow and unreliable internet connections in recent times, ISPs have said.

Stressing that this was an unfortunate ‘force majeure’, a representative from Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group (VNPT) said the provider was actively deploying measures to ensure international internet connections to its consumers, including sharing data loads between still available international lines, working with Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube, as well as optimising traffic on different cables.

Thanks to these efforts, platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube can still be accessed normally, while financial, banking, and insurance transactions can still be conducted.

Mobile data connections are also ensured, according to a VNPT representative.

However, it stressed that with breakages occurring on four out of five undersea cables, internet access would suffer, especially in ‘peak hours’ with activities that demand large data like online games or watching movies, etc.

The military-run provider Viettel similarly has devised re-routing plans to regulate traffic on the remaining sea cable and land cables, and buy additional emergency capacity to ensure the best service quality for customers.

Major domestic service providers are actively working with submarine cable systems and ship operators to determine the cause of the issues, the location of the incident and the repair plan, in the shortest time possible.

Other smaller providers like CMC and NetNam are also making moves to mitigate the incident’s consequences like pushing more traffic onto land cables via China and Cambodia.","The article titled 'Internet slows as Vietnam submarine cables suffer unprecedented disruptions' discusses significant issues related to four out of five submarine internet cables connecting Vietnam to the world.

**Published Date:** 05/01/2024  
**Author:** 台北時報  

**SECURITY PREPAREDNESS:** An NSB report detailed the measures it was taking to protect critical national infrastructure with security redundancies and inspections.  

National Security Bureau (NSB) Director-General Tsai Ming-yen (蔡明彥) yesterday told lawmakers that Taiwan must harden its undersea cables, but refrained from accusing Beijing of sabotaging the lines.  

Tsai made the remarks during a meeting of the legislature’s Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee in Taipei after Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Hung Sun-han (洪申翰) asked the NSB head whether the cutting of the cables linking Taiwan proper to Lienchiang County (Matsu), which occurred multiple times last year, were accidents or acts of sabotage.  

Several Washington-based think tanks have suggested that Beijing might have deliberately targeted the cables, as the damaged lines were in shallow depths of 30m to 100m, Hung said.  

The cables were on the main belt of China’s “gray zone” activities, making the case for sabotage more likely, he said.  

The Ministry of Digital Affairs did not include the cables in its list of critical infrastructure, he said, adding that items on the list are to undergo regular threat evaluations and defensive drills, and be protected by robust alert systems.  

Hung then asked Tsai if the NSB was taking steps to protect the undersea cables.  

Although the lines were cut 20 times last year, an unusually high number of incidents, the bureau is not prepared to declare the episodes malicious actions, as intentionality could not be proven without a thorough analysis of ship movements in the area during the events, Tsai said.  

Taiwan operates 14 international undersea cables linking the nation to the world and 10 cables to its outlying islands, he said, adding that the Ministry of Digital Affairs is focused on bolstering the resilience of the former.  

Nevertheless, the cables to Matsu remain crucial to national security despite their exclusion from the list, he said.  

Separately, the NSB submitted to legislators a report detailing the bureau’s efforts to harden national infrastructure against attacks.  

Citing the National Intelligence Service Act (國家情報工作法), the report said that the NSB is empowered to preside over agencies involved in securing important sites, including the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau, the National Police Agency and Military Police Command.  

The agencies are to send regular reports to the Executive Yuan’s Office of Homeland Security and maintain communication on matters concerning infrastructure security, it said.  

A planned NSB task force would advise the office on risks, threats and weaknesses, it said, adding that natural disasters, human-caused hazards and cyberattacks are the main types of dangers to infrastructure.  

Dual redundancy, frequent inspections, thorough background checks on personnel, security incident response exercises, and the full use of public and private resources are among the measures that would mitigate dangers, the report said.  

Mitigation requires good data security and information-sharing practices, and the monitoring of emergent threats and security trends, it said.  

The Executive Yuan began introducing dual redundancy to key oil, water, electricity and telecommunications infrastructure following a malfunction at Kaohsiung’s Hsinta Power Plant (興達電廠) in 2022 that triggered a nationwide power outage, it said.  

A critical infrastructure security inspection system created last year would be implemented on 40 select sites, starting this year, it said.  

Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau would be tasked with convening a national-level conference on infrastructure security and enforce new security-related rules added to standard public construction contract templates, the NSB said.  

The Executive Yuan is to hold annual Chin Hwa exercises (金華演習) to train personnel involved with the operation of critical infrastructure in responding to contingencies to boost resiliency, it said.  

The Office of Homeland Security would this year conduct security incident response exercises at 20 sites, the NSB said, adding that national security officials would observe drills and exercises.","The article titled ""Taiwan must harden undersea cables, NSB says"" discusses multiple incidents of undersea cables being cut in Taiwan, specifically noting that the cables linking Taiwan to Lienchiang County were cut 20 times last year.

It explores the implications of these incidents for national security and includes insights from the National Security Bureau (NSB) on the need to protect these critical infrastructures.

The discussion includes concerns about whether these cuts are accidental or potential acts of sabotage, particularly in light of geopolitical tensions.

Overall, the article focuses primarily on the topic of cut sea cables, detailing both the incidents and their security ramifications."

A rare weekend news briefing followed a confrontation in the South China Sea between a Vietnamese oil and gas survey ship and Chinese patrol boats.

Vietnam says the boats deliberately cut the survey ship's cables in Vietnamese waters. China denies the allegation.

China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan all claim territories in the South China Sea.

The area includes an important shipping route and is also thought to contain oil and gas deposits.

The spat comes just days before a regional security conference in Singapore.

Beijing said its defence minister would attend the IISS Asia Security Summit, the Shangri-La Dialogue, to promote co-operation and stability in the Asia Pacific region.

The latest clash involving Chinese patrol boats occurred 120km (80 miles) off the south-central coast of Vietnam and some 600km south of China's Hainan island.

""The Vietnamese navy will do everything necessary to firmly protect peace and the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Vietnam,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Nguyen Phuong Nga said.

One of three Chinese patrol vessels on the scene intentionally cut a submerged cable towed by the ship, the Binh Minh 02, said Do Van Hau, deputy chief executive of state oil and gas group PetroVietnam, which was operating the ship.

""Chinese vessels were at very high speed and did not respond to our ship's warning and then cut the cables of the Binh Minh 02, about 2km from where it was positioned,"" he said.

China's foreign ministry blamed Vietnam for the incident, saying its oil and gas operations ""undermined China's interests and jurisdictional rights"".

China's claim in the South China Sea is by far the largest, and includes the Spratly and Paracel archipelagos.

Taiwan recently said it would improve the defence capability of more than 100 coastguard troops stationed in a disputed area of the South China Sea.

Taiwan's decision was announced shortly after the Philippines increased the pressure recently by lodging a protest at the United Nations against China's claims to the area.

Last year, China sharply rebuked US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton when she said the US supported the freedom of navigation in the area and offered to facilitate multilateral talks on the disputes.","The article discusses a confrontation in the South China Sea where Vietnamese officials accused Chinese patrol boats of deliberately cutting the cables of a survey ship, the Binh Minh 02.

"Experts Clarify Causes of Asian Internet Issues","Examines human-induced faults in the Asia America Gateway submarine cable system, leading to significant internet outages in Vietnam.","https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/564388/don-t-blame-sharks-asian-internet-problems-experts-say","2023-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","Tim Hornyak",Yes,"Tim Hornyak","San Francisco, California, US","150000","2023-06-02","English","PC World Australia","This frame grab from a YouTube video, which has garnered nearly 1 million views, shows a bluntnose sixgill shark biting a submarine cable.

It may not be Shark Week, but don't tell that to people in Vietnam.

Internet connections in the South East Asian nation have been affected by problems with the Asia America Gateway (AAG) submarine cable system for the fourth time in a year, according to local news outlets. The cause of the outages? Sharks, if you believe some online reports.

As AAG has the highest capacity of cable systems linking to Vietnam, faults can have big consequences for its international Internet bandwidth.

Vietnam's latest woes aren't the first time sharks have been made out to be a threat to the Internet. Last year, a 2010 YouTube video, showing a shark biting a submarine cable, made the rounds again, approaching a million views, when a Google official said the search giant wraps its ocean cables in Kevlar to defend against sharks.

With 99 percent of all transoceanic Internet traffic now flowing through submarine cables, how large of a threat are these big fish? Michael Costin, Chairman of the AAG Cable Consortium, says the damage was likely caused by ship anchors or fishing.

""AAG is not yet aware of the cause of the advised fault, but strongly believes it is not caused by sharks,"" Costin said via email. ""Consistent with past experience, AAG believes it is most likely to be as a consequence of damage due to ship anchors or fishing, which reportedly are the predominant causes of faults experienced by submarine cables.""

The fault occurred 117 kilometers off Vung Tau in the southern part of the country. Costin said the consortium's local partner is working with Vietnam's coast guard to protect the AAG cable.

He points to research by the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC), a global industry group which claims that 65 to 75 percent of cable faults are due to anchoring and fishing. It found no cable problems that were caused by sharks from 2008 to 2013, compared to 11 cases between 1959 and 2006 as documented by the United Nations Environment Programme's World Conservation Monitoring Centre.

The ICPC says advances in cable design have ""effectively eliminated the problem."" Modern cables wrap a core of optical fibers in multiple protective layers including a copper or aluminum tube as well as a fiberglass or plastic shell. Cables laid near shore or fishing grounds are often equipped with an additional shield of steel wires and buried.

""As for shark bites, its like a joke within this industry,"" Shota Masuda, a senior manager in NEC's Submarine Network Division, said via email. ""Google made a remark last year about this, and this brought back a few papers written about this topic into the light, but in reality, sharks do not bite fiber optic submarine cables.""

The continuing importance of marine cables has been highlighted by Google's recent investments in the infrastructure. NEC, one of the top three submarine cable makers along with Alcatel-Lucent and TE SubCom, is part of a consortium including Google working on the US$300 million FASTER cable system between Japan and the U.S. With six fiber pairs and 100 wavelengths, it will have a capacity of 60Tbps when it comes online in 2016. As Google described it, that's about ten million times faster than your cable modem.

NEC manufactured cables used in the 20,000km-long AAG system. Masuda says that the AAG Consortium is responsible for maintaining the link but said that cables can get cut by dropped anchors, trawler nets and undersea earthquakes. NEC's underwater cables, he said, are rated to last for 25 years at depths of up to 8 kilometers.

Biologists, meanwhile, say sharks are known to bite submarine cables. How much damage they can cause depends on the species and the cable itself.

""Underwater cables are sometimes bitten and damaged by sharks,"" Kazuhiro Nakaya, a marine scientist and professor emeritus at Hokkaido University, said via email. ""Although 8,000m below the sea level is a little too deep for sharks (the deepest shark record is less than 5,000m), it is possible that the cables settled shallower areas are damaged by sharks.""

Sharks are attracted by electromagnetic fields they can pick up through sensing organs called electroreceptors, which are located in their snouts and heads.

""They cruise along the bottom trying to detect bioelectric fields from prey living on the bottom and also looking for the light flashes of bioluminescent prey,"" Dean Grubbs, an associate scholar scientist at Florida State University Coastal and Marine Laboratory, said via email. He was referring to the bluntnose sixgill, which he said is the shark in the 2010 video on YouTube.

""Though their jaws are relatively weak, they have saw blade-shaped teeth and tend to bite large food items (including carrion like dead whales) and then twist their large body until they saw out a hunk of flesh. It is possible that a large shark feeding in this way could damage submarine cables.""

Grubbs said he has seen experiments showing sharks orienting to a weak electromagnetic field emanating from an electrode. A transatlantic cable laid in the 1980s by AT&T was found to have been damaged several times by undersea attackers, primarily crocodile sharks, Grubbs said. He added, however, that ""most deep-sea sharks have relatively weakly calcified jaws so their bite force is quite low.""

That, combined with better protection for cables than in the past, suggests human activity is what has been affecting the Internet in Vietnam. According to the management consortium's Costin, anchoring and fishing were responsible for all the faults last year. It's expected to be fully restored by Jan. 27.","The article discusses the impact of issues with the Asia America Gateway (AAG) submarine cable system on internet connectivity in Vietnam.

It mentions 'submarine cables' and 'cable faults' directly, and explains how these faults have led to internet outages, attributing the causes to human activities rather than sharks.

SEACOM did not give any explanation for the cuts it said hit its cables and other network systems funnelling telecoms traffic backwards and forwards in the early hours of Friday.

Web users have reported slower connections across Egypt since then.

The firm, which carries traffic for other companies, said on Wednesday services had been restored only to report hours later another connection had been cut.

The telecoms infrastructure snaking under the Mediterranean has suffered several disruptions in recent years. In the past, some operators and users have suggested cables had been caught in the propellers of passing ships.

“During this time, certain bandwidth-intensive, (non-http) applications such as online gaming and peer to peer applications will be moderately affected due to traffic prioritisation steps taken by etisalat,” the operator added.

Etisalat confirmed that it had experienced temporary drops in internet service quality in the immediate aftermath of the undersea earthquake, which registered 7.1 on the Richter scale and which killed two people.

The quake, which occurred on December 26, resulted in massive damage to seven of the eight major undersea fiber-optic communication cables near southern Taiwan.

Etisalat said it coped with the disaster by tapping into its contingency excess capacity and by making use of additional bandwidth allocated to it by other service providers.

The operator said its team worked round the clock to monitor and ensure traffic prioritisation and allocation of greater resources to critical internet based applications and services.

The underwater trans-Pacific cable that provides internet to much of Southeast Asia saw the latest in a series of ruptures that have blighted Vietnam and other countries in recent months yesterday, causing millions to experience slow or intermittent connections.

While previous theories have included foul play and snagging by anchors, the reason behind the breakages is increasingly thought to be sharks chomping down on the cables.

Indeed videos such as the one above clearly show sharks biting fibre optic cables, perhaps because they mistake electromagnetic waves for bioelectric fields that surround schools of fish.

According to the cable operator Asia-America Gateway (AAG), the ruptures were reported offshore Ba Ria in Vung Tau Province and are now being located.

The 20,000km system required fixing three times last year.

#### By Anna Gross and Alexandra Heal, Financial Times  
February 10, 2023

China has cut its participation in an internet cable project to link Asia with Europe, as tensions grow between Washington and Beijing over control of the physical infrastructure that transmits the world’s online traffic.

Two of China’s biggest telecoms groups, China Telecom and China Mobile, withdrew their combined investment of roughly 20 per cent from the subsea cable project last year after a US company was selected to build the line over Hengtong Marine, the country’s biggest provider in the sector, according to three people briefed on the decision.

Their exit from the Sea-Me-We 6 pipeline — which is estimated to cost around $500mn to lay 19,200km of cables connecting south-east Asia to western Europe — highlights the growing battle between China and the US over who builds and owns the infrastructure underpinning the global internet.

The departure of China Mobile and China Telecom is an indication of intensifying tensions between Washington and Beijing, according to industry figures with knowledge of the project. Another member of the consortium described their involvement as “important but not critical”.

China Unicom, a much smaller state-owned company, has remained involved with an unspecified investment in the project, which is expected to complete in 2025.

Since 2020, the US has denied permission for several subsea telecoms cables that involved Chinese companies or directly connected the US to mainland China or Hong Kong, citing national security concerns.

The strained Sino-US relationship is reshaping the global technology sector, as companies and countries are forced to respond to the pressure exerted by the two economic powerhouses.

Last October, Washington unveiled tough export controls to prevent China obtaining advanced chips or securing the technology and equipment to make high-end semiconductors domestically.

The Sea-Me-We 6 consortium, which includes Microsoft, Orange and Telecom Egypt, opted for US company SubCom to build the line rather than the bid from Hengtong Marine — prompting the two Chinese state-owned groups to exit, the people said.","The article 'China Pulls Back From SEA-ME-WE 6' discusses China's withdrawal from the SEA-ME-WE 6 subsea cable project, which is a significant undersea cable initiative.

The focus on the SEA-ME-WE 6 project and its impact on telecommunications indicates that cut sea cables are a central theme of the article, meeting the criterion."

As such, people often mistakenly assume that internet traffic happens by air – our mobile devices, after all, aren't wired to anything.

But satellites carry less than 1 percent of human interactions, and in some ways the truth is far more impressive than messages sent by tower signal.

The internet – arguably the most important resource in the modern world – is very tangible and fairly vulnerable. It exists in large part under our feet, by way of an intricate system of rope-thin underwater and underground cables hooked to giant data storage units so powerful, they're capable of recalling any piece of information at a moment's notice.

Here's what the infrastructure of the internet actually looks like today:

**In the most basic sense, the internet's job is to carry information from point A to point B.**

Those points are IP addresses – the unique codes that identify locations around the world – and they're what your devices are linked to when you're connected to the internet. Curious what yours is? If you type ""My IP address"" into Google, the search engine will bring it up.

**As it travels, any information transferred over the web arrives at internet data servers, which live in data centres around the world. In 2008, an estimated 9.5 trillion gigabytes passed in and out of the world's servers — but more on those later.**

**Moving information to and from servers often involves crossing oceans. We rely almost entirely on cables for internet traffic because they're faster and cheaper than satellites, but laying them across bodies of water is a tedious process that's taken almost 200 years and requires a lot of maintenance.**

**To get the internet to what it is today, humans have slowly laid over 300 underwater cables that run a total of 550,000 miles.**

About 97 percent of all intercontinental data is transferred through these cables, according to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.

**If the world's underwater cables were laid out end-to-end, the cables could extend from here to the moon and back again, and then wrap around the earth's widest point almost three times.**

**The longest cable is about 24,000 miles long. It extends from Germany to Korea and even further south to Australia, hitting 39 different landing points along the way.**

The first transcontinental cable was laid down in 1858, and ran from Ireland to Newfoundland.

**There are a few different types of cables used underwater, ranging in thickness from a garden hose to about three inches in diameter. The lightest (far right) are laid primarily in the deep ocean floor.**

At the heart of the cables are the fibre optic wires that transmit information, protected by water-resistant petroleum jelly and layers of stranded metal.

**Laying each cable down requires several months, millions of dollars, and a very large ship with miles of cable coiled up onboard.**

**Some cables are laid as deep as 25,000 feet below the surface of the ocean, meaning they're subject to damage from natural disasters, corrosion, fishers, and even shark bites.**

**Break repairs are handled by special ships with small hooks that pull the cable up or cut it in two and bring both halves up for mending. At least 50 cable breaks a year happen in the Atlantic alone, according to MIT Tech Review.**

**The cables come back to shore at cable landing points and make their way to data centres by travelling underground. Maintenance and planning for underground cables is easier than underwater cables in some ways (like the fact that they don't have to deal with shark bites) but still challenging in other ways.**

**In the US, there are 542 cables connecting at 273 different points.**

The first publicly available map of the US's cable network wasn't available until 2015. It took Paul Barford and his team of researchers almost four years to pull it together.

**The ecosystem of cables depends largely on the country's infrastructure. In the US, for example, most of the long-haul cables are located along major roads and railways.**

**For cables under dry land, construction is a big concern. To prevent the cables from being dug up, they're laid alongside gas pipes or inside old pipelines, with aboveground markers along the way.**

**Similar to underwater cables, cables in dry ground are subject to damage from natural disasters, like earthquakes.**

**The cables eventually reach the aforementioned data centres, and navigate to the machine servers.**

**These are typically unmarked buildings located in both rural areas far outside of city limits and in buildings within highly populated cities, hidden in plain sight.**

**In fact, one of the world's most concentrated hubs in terms of internet connectivity is located in lower Manhattan at 60 Hudson Street.**

A company called Telx operates out of the 9th floor, where local, national, and global channels come together to transmit data.

**And there are two other major hubs in New York, located at 111 Eighth Avenue — the old Port Authority building that Google recently purchased for $US1.9 billion — and 32 Avenue of the Americas.**

**Each data center consumes massive amounts of energy. Apple recently built two solar energy installations to help power its North Carolina data center, which requires 20 megawatts of power at full capacity.**

**They're filled with ""deafeningly noisy rooms cocooning racks of servers and routers,"" where you're ""buffeted by hot and cold air that blusters through everything,"" according to designer and artist Timo Arnall who documented a large European data center called Telefónica.**

**The ceilings have to be 12 to 14 feet high to support rising heat from the servers.**

**If that doesn't sound like a place you want to spend your time, keep in mind that you don't really have a choice: data centres are very difficult to get into.**

**From the outside, these unassuming buildings serve as the most glaring proof we have that the internet is more physical than we think.**","The article discusses underwater cables extensively, noting that they are crucial for internet connectivity, with 97% of intercontinental data transferred through them.

It mentions the vulnerabilities and damage to these cables, including at least 50 breaks annually in the Atlantic, indicating a strong focus on the implications of cut sea cables."

Damage to fibre-optic cables from the Japan earthquake highlights the vulnerability of Australia's international communication links, says one expert.  
Two cables linking Japan and the United States were damaged following the 9.0 magnitude earthquake, causing a 30 per cent slowing of bandwidth. The damage may take a month to repair.  
While Australia's communication system wasn't affected by the Japan quake, it is extremely vulnerable to natural disasters, says Professor James Goff, of the University of New South Wales in Sydney.  
""We were very lucky from this particular instance in Japan that no more cables were broken,"" says Goff, director of the Australian Tsunami Research Centre and Natural Hazards Research Laboratory.  
Australia is heavily dependent upon a network of fibre-optic cables that cross the Pacific Ocean carrying to 99 per cent of Australia's voice and data traffic.  
Around 70 per cent of this traffic flows through Hawaii, the rest flows through other 'choke points' in Indonesia and Guam - all of which are subject to major natural events, says Goff.  
""We are surrounded in the Pacific by the Ring of Fire and these [cables] go across it. So there is an element of concern about how exposed we are,"" says Goff, adding that much of the infrastructure is old and difficult to replace.  
""Tens of billions of dollars of our economy is pumped through these things. If you ... slow it down by 20 per cent how many billions of dollars does that represent to our economy?""  
**Previous warning**  
Two years ago Goff warned, in a paper published in Natural Hazards Earth Systems Science, that Australia has very little understanding about how natural events can affect the major bottlenecks located in unstable regions such as Hawaii, and called for urgent research into the risks to telecommunications.  
""This is going to become an increasing problem,"" he says. ""We are putting more and more traffic down more and more cables and putting more and more cables underground.""  
Even a minor disruption could have huge impacts, he warns. For example, the 2006 Taiwan earthquake damaged several underwater fibre-optic cables and slowed down Australia's communication system for two months.  
""It's the classic case of 'let's not do anything about it because we haven't had a serious problem yet' but when a serious problem comes along, what are we going to do about it then?"" asks Goff.  
He has renewed his calls for more research into the threats posed to the network across the Pacific.  
""We need to go out and find out what the hell is happening in Hawaii, what the hell is happening in Indonesia to try to find out the implications it has for us,"" says Goff.","The article discusses the impact of the 2011 Japan earthquake on undersea communication cables, highlighting damage to fibre-optic cables that caused significant internet bandwidth slowdowns.

It emphasizes Australia's reliance on these cables for communication and the potential economic impacts of disruptions.

The central theme revolves around the vulnerability of these cables to natural disasters, making it clear that the article is focused on the topic of cut sea cables."

Taipei (AFP) Jan 23, 2007  
Newly discovered earthquake damage to undersea cables and bad weather could delay the complete restoration of Asian Internet services until next month, telecom officials said last week. A spokesman for Taiwan's Chunghwa Telecom said engineers had found new damage to cables servicing China, putting back repairs by about a week.  
""As we are short of direct transportation between Taiwan and the mainland, it will take four or five days to transport the needed cables from the mainland via a third place,"" a company official told AFP.  
The official said he expected repair work on the cables, damaged by a powerful 7.1-magnitude earthquake on December 26, to be finished by the end of January.  
""But I cannot say for sure because bad weather may hamper the continued work. It may add uncertainty to the work,"" he said.  
Hong Kong officials also warned that poor weather could delay repairs well into next month.  
""Due to inclement weather conditions and the extensive nature of the damages caused by the earthquakes, the latest status is that the first stage of the repairing work of the damaged submarine cable systems is expected to be completed within the second half of this month,"" the Office of Telecommunications Authority said in a statement.  
It said the rest of the repairs would be completed by the middle of February, if weather permits.  
The Boxing Day earthquake snapped several international telecom cables, sparking widespread communications disruption in Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and elsewhere. Knock-on problems occurred as far away as Australia.  
Phone calls and Internet connections across the Asia-Pacific region were affected by the quake, which rocked left two people dead and at least 42 injured in Taiwan.  
The epicenter was 10 kilometres (six miles) under the sea, 57 miles from Taiwan's southern city of Kaohsiung.  
Eight repair boats have been sent to the waters between Hong Kong and Taiwan to tackle the complicated task of fixing the damaged fibre-optic cables, the Chunghwa official said.  
Currently nearly 95 percent of the Taiwan's telecommunications capacity has been restored although access to some foreign websites remains slightly slow, he said.  
Hong Kong's telecoms authority said major Internet service providers have recovered about 80 percent of their international connection capacity.  
In China, web access has remained sluggish compared to before the earthquake.

#### Biz & IT —

A deep dive into Internet infrastructure, plus a rare visit to a subsea cable landing site.

**The secret world of cable landing sites**

BT might be teasing its customers with the promise of fibre to the home (FTTH) to boost bandwidth, and Virgin Media has a pretty decent service, offering speeds of up to 200Mbps for domestic users on its hybrid fibre-coaxial (HFC) network. But as it says on the tin, the _World_ Wide Web is a global network. Providing an Internet service goes beyond the mere capabilities of a single ISP on this sceptred isle or, indeed, the capabilities of any single ISP anywhere in the world.

First we’re going to take a rare look at one of the most unusual and interesting strands of the Internet and how it arrives onshore in Britain. We’re not talking dark fibre between terrestrial data centres 50 miles apart, but the landing station where Tata’s Atlantic submarine cable terminates at a mysterious location on the west coast of England after its 6,500km journey from New Jersey in the USA.

Connecting to the US is critical for any serious international communications company, and Tata’s Global Network (TGN) is the only wholly owned fibre ring encircling the planet. It amounts to a 700,000km subsea and terrestrial network with more than 400 points of presence worldwide.

Tata is willing to share, though; it’s not just there so the CEO’s kids get the best latency when playing _Call of Duty_, and the better half can stream _Game of Thrones_ without a hitch. At any one time Tata’s Tier 1 network is handling 24 percent of the world’s Internet traffic, so the chance to get up close and personal with TGN-A (Atlantic), TGN-WER (Western Europe), and their cable consortium friends is not to be missed.

The site itself is a pretty much vanilla data centre from the outside, appearing grey and anonymous—they could be crating cabbages in there for all you’d know. Inside, it’s RFID cards to move around the building and fingerprint readers to access the data centre areas, but first a cuppa and a chat in the boardroom. This isn’t your typical data centre, and some aspects need explaining. In particular, submarine cable systems have extraordinary power requirements, all supported by extensive backup facilities.

### Armoured submarine cables

Carl Osborne, Tata’s VP of international network development, joined us to add his insights during the tour. When it comes to Tata’s submarine cable network, he has actually been on board the cable ship to watch it all happen. He brought with him some subsea cable samples to show how the design changes depending on the depth. The nearer to the surface you get, the more protection—armour—you need to withstand potential disturbances from shipping. Trenches are dug and cables buried in shallow waters coming up onto shore. At greater depths, though, areas such as the West European Basin, which is almost three miles from the surface, there’s no need for armour, as merchant shipping poses no threat at all to cables on the seabed.

At these depths, cable diameter is just 17mm, akin to a marker pen encased by a thick polyethylene insulating sheath. A copper conductor surrounds multiple strands of steel wire that protect the optical fibres at the core, which are inside a steel tube less than 3mm in diameter and cushioned in thixotropic jelly. Armoured cables have the same arrangement internally but are clad with one or more layers of galvanised steel wire, which is wrapped around the entire cable.

Without the copper conductor, you wouldn’t have a subsea cable. Fibre-optic technology is fast and seemingly capable of unlimited bandwidth, but it can’t cover long distances without a little help. Repeaters—effectively signal amplifiers—are required to boost the light transmission over the length of the fibre optic cable. This is easily achieved on land with local power, but on the ocean bed the amplifiers receive a DC voltage from the cable’s copper conductor. And where does that power come from? The cable landing sites at either end of the cable.

Although the customers wouldn’t know it, TGN-A is actually two cables that take diverse paths to straddle the Atlantic. If one cable goes down, the other is there to ensure continuity. The alternative TGN-A lands at a different site some 70 miles (and three terrestrial amplifiers) away and receives its power from there, too. One of these transatlantic subsea cables has 148 amplifiers, while the other slightly longer route requires 149.

Site managers tend not to seek out the limelight, so we’ll call our cable landing site tour guide John, who explains more about this configuration.

“To power the cable from this end, we’ve a positive voltage and in New Jersey there’s a negative voltage on the cable. We try and maintain the current—the voltage is free to find the resistance of the cable. It’s about 9,000V, and we share the voltage between the two ends. It’s called a dual-end feed, so we’re on about 4,500V each end. In normal conditions we could power the cable from here to New Jersey without any support from the US.”

Needless to say, the amplifiers are designed to be maintenance-free for 25 years, as you’re not going to be sending divers down to change a fuse. Yet looking at the cable sample itself, with a mere eight strands of optical fibre inside, you can’t help but think that, for all the effort involved, there should be more.

“The limitations are on the size of the amplifier. For eight fibre pairs you’d need twice the size of amplifier,” says John, and as the amplifier scales up, so does the need for power.

At the landing site, the eight fibres that make up TGN-A exist as four pairs, each pair comprising a distinct send and receive fibre. The individual fibre strands are coloured, such that if it’s broken, and a repair needs to be done at sea, the technicians know how to splice it back together again. Similarly, those on land can identify what goes where when plugging into the Submarine Line Terminal Equipment (SLTE).

### Fixing cables at sea

After the landing site trip, I spoke to Peter Jamieson, a fibre network support specialist at Virgin Media, for a few more details on submarine cable maintenance. “Once the cable has been found and returned to the cable-repair ship, a new piece of undamaged cable is attached. The ROV [remotely operated vehicle] then returns to the seabed, finds the other end of the cable and makes the second join. It then uses a high-pressure water jet to bury the cable up to 1.5 metres under the seabed,” he says.

“Repairs normally take around 10 days from the moment the cable repair ship is launched, with four to five days spent at the location of the break. Fortunately, such incidents are rare: Virgin Media has only had to deal with two in the past seven years.","The article discusses submarine cables extensively, including their construction, maintenance, and the implications of damage.

It specifically addresses the process of repairing cables when they are cut or damaged, detailing the steps involved and the time required for repairs.

They’re the reason you can Skype your colleague in Sydney or text with your friend in Mumbai. They’re essential infrastructure for the global economy. It’s no wonder, as _The New York Times_ reported this week, that US military officials are not at all comfortable with Russian subs and spy ships “aggressively operating” in their vicinity.

Despite the importance of this undersea network, most people never give it a thought until something goes wrong, or seems likely to. Nicole Starosielski wants to change that. Starosielski, a media scholar at New York University, spent six years traveling the globe to study the history of the cable network and the cultural, political, and environmental forces that have shaped it. Her work also highlights the vulnerability of this system.

“We usually think of the internet as distributed,” Starosielski says. Because of the built-in redundancies, an attack at a given point in the terrestrial network is unlikely to bring the whole thing down. Not so under the sea. “I think people would be surprised to know that there are a little over 200 systems that carry all of the internet traffic across the ocean, and these are by and large concentrated in very few areas. The cables end up getting funneled through these narrow pressure points all around the globe.”

Starosielski’s book _The Undersea Network_, published earlier this year, examines some of the reasons for this. They range from politics to undersea topography to seismic risks. A companion website lets you explore the Pacific cable network with interactive maps, histories of the various cables, and photos of the sometimes spooky, sometimes mundane places where they come ashore.

The first transoceanic cable, a copper telegraph wire, was laid across the Atlantic in 1866. The cables put down in the following decades followed colonial era shipping routes, and many modern cables follow these same old routes. In the 1950s, coaxial cable, capable of carrying telephone conversations became the standard. Then, in the 1990s, these analog cables were edged into obsolescence by fiber optic cables able to carry huge amounts of digital data in the form of light. (If you’re even remotely curious about how these cables work and how they get laid on the ocean floor, check out Neal Stephenson’s epic 1996 WIRED article about one global networks.)

The undersea cables have been the subject of international intrigue before. Back in 1959 the _Times_ reported that the US Navy boarded and searched a Russian fishing trawler off Newfoundland on suspicions that it had tampered with cables. (The boarding party found no incriminating evidence).

Not that the Russians were the only ones interested in the cables. In the 1970s, the US Navy deployed divers from submarines to tap secret Soviet military communications cables, an effort known as Operation Ivy Bells.

But it doesn't take a navy to mess with the cables, which these days are roughly the diameter of a garden hose. “They have to wind these things up and throw them in the back of boats, so they have to be as light as possible,” Starosielski explains. A 2006 earthquake severed cables and disrupted internet access in Taiwan. In 2007, scrap metal salvagers pulled up parts of two fiber optic cables off Vietnam, disrupting internet service there for several months. Sharks, apparently, are also a threat.

By far the most common problems, however—accounting for about 60 percent of cut cable incidents—are dropped anchors and fishing nets, Starosielski says. For that reason, the cables are clearly marked by pink squiggly lines on navigational charts, and, on the water, signs warning boaters not to drop anchor. The flip side of all these warnings is a potential tip off to would-be saboteurs.

Cable sabotage was common during both World Wars, but Starosielski says she knows of no recent incidents. That doesn’t mean it couldn’t happen, though. It would be relatively easy to cut a cable near shore, but such damage would also be easy to find and repair. The _Times_ article raises a greater concern: the possibility of cuts made to deep-lying cables in remote parts of the ocean.

In her book, Starosielski notes that the strategy for safeguarding undersea cables has been described as “security through obscurity.” Nobody gave much thought to the cables, and that was enough to protect them. In the future, it might not be.","The article ""Undersea Internet Cables Are Surprisingly Vulnerable"" discusses various aspects of undersea cables, including their vulnerability and incidents of disruption.

It mentions specific events where cables were cut, such as a 2006 earthquake that severed cables in Taiwan and a 2007 incident involving scrap metal salvagers in Vietnam.

Additionally, it highlights that dropped anchors and fishing nets account for 60% of cable cut incidents.

**Author:** Reuters Staff  

NAIROBI, April 16 (Reuters) - Foreign navies have agreed to protect a vessel installing an undersea high-speed Internet cable from pirates off the coast of Somalia, a Kenyan minister said on Thursday.

Sea gangs from lawless Somalia have been increasingly striking the Indian Ocean shipping lanes and strategic Gulf of Aden, capturing dozens of vessels and hundreds of hostages in attacks that have driven up insurance rates.

Patrols by Western navies have done little to deter the attacks.

Kenyan Information and Communications Minister Samuel Poghisio said the 5,000 km (3,107 miles) fibre optic cable was on course for completion in June.

Last month, a government official said the route for the East African Marine Cable (TEAMS) had been shifted an extra 200 km from the coastline for fear of pirates.

""These are concerns we have but they are being addressed. We know it will be secure and will land in Mombasa on time,"" Poghisio said in a statement on Thursday.

""The process (of laying the cable) has begun and will probably take two months. It is likely that by the middle of June the ship should be anchoring in Mombasa, or rather delivering the cable to Mombasa,"" he added.

The $130 million cable will link Kenya's coastal town of Mombasa with Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates.

Kenya has been putting down a terrestrial cable connecting different parts of the country to prepare for the arrival of the marine cable, which could be east Africa's first speedy but cheap telecoms link with the rest of the world.

Another undersea project known as SEACOM is also expected to be operational in the second half of 2009 and two others are due to land in 2010 -- the Eastern African Submarine Cable System (EASSy) and the France Telecom/Orange Sat3-wasc-Safe cable.

Hong Kong (AFP) Jan 02, 2007  
Hong Kong telecom authorities assumed emergency powers Tuesday as firms faced Internet disruption on the first day back to work after an earthquake damaged regional undersea data cables. Telecom and Internet service providers sent the city's telecom authority OFTA hourly updates on service capacity as repair ships struggled to mend fibre optic cables severed in the Boxing Day quake off Taiwan.

""We put the emergency response system in place this morning as this was the first day that businesses and schools resumed operations after the Christmas and New Year holidays,"" said Ha Yung-kuen, OFTA's acting director general of telecommunications.

OFTA had received only 20 inquiries from Internet users by mid-morning, suggesting that services had not been hit as hard as had been feared.

By the close of business OFTA said traffic had moved smoothly and there had been no reports of serious congestion.

""The situation is better than we expected,"" Ha said, adding that Internet service providers had rerouted much of their traffic through land links with China and via satellite networks.

Ha said international phone calls, mobile services and fax lines were back to normal a week after the Boxing Day temblor ripped through submarine data cables in the Taiwan Straits.

The cables carry most of the region's digital traffic. All but one of the seven submarine links, which carry international data in and out of Hong Kong, snapped and Internet capacity was down to 70 percent.

""Service operators have said they will give priority to companies during business hours, so that means personal users will experience some delays,"" Ha said.

He added that smaller companies depending on bought-in Internet services rather than their own networks would suffer most.

He urged surfers to avoid accessing large overseas-based Web pages to conserve capacity.

The 7.1-magnitude earthquake sparked widespread communications disruption in Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and elsewhere. Knock-on problems occurred as far away as Australia.

One repair ship was already in the damage zone working on Hong Kong's cables, while another was in port receiving repairs for damage sustained in rough seas. Another four were on their way, Ha added.

""If we can get just one of the six broken cables back in service, Hong Kong's Internet capacity can be brought back to normal levels by the middle of this month,"" he said.

The rest would be repaired by the end of the month he added.

Internet connections in the South East Asian nation have been affected by problems with the Asia America Gateway (AAG) submarine cable system for the fourth time in a year. The cause of the outages? Sharks, if you believe some online reports.

As AAG has the highest capacity of cable systems linking to Vietnam, faults can have big consequences for its international Internet bandwidth.

Michael Costin, Chairman of the AAG Cable Consortium, says the damage was likely caused by ship anchors or fishing. ""AAG is not yet aware of the cause of the advised fault, but strongly believes it is not caused by sharks,"" Costin said via email. 

The fault occurred 117 kilometers off Vung Tau in the southern part of the country. Costin said the consortium's local partner is working with Vietnam's coast guard to protect the AAG cable.

Research by the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) claims that 65 to 75 percent of cable faults are due to anchoring and fishing. They found no cable problems caused by sharks from 2008 to 2013, compared to 11 cases between 1959 and 2006.

Advances in cable design have effectively eliminated the problem. Modern cables wrap a core of optical fibers in multiple protective layers, making them less vulnerable to damage.

Sharks are known to bite submarine cables, but their ability to cause significant damage is limited. According to marine scientists, while sharks are attracted to electromagnetic fields emitted by cables, the risks are minimal compared to human activities.

"Internet Traffic Jam in Asia Due to Submarine Cable Break","10% decrease in routing through HKIX following Typhoon Soudelor's impact on the Flag North Asian Loop cable.","https://blog.apnic.net/2015/08/21/internet-traffic-jam-in-asia-as-submarine-cable-breaks","2015-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","Robbie Mitchell",Yes,"Robbie Mitchell","Brisbane, Queensland, Australia","5000","2015-08-21","English","APNIC","**Internet Traffic Jam in Asia Due to Submarine Cable Break**

East Asia is in the middle of an Internet traffic jam as engineers fix a cut in one of the region’s significant submarine cables.

The Flag North Asian Loop/ Reach North Asian Loop submarine cable, which links Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, was cut around 10 August, according to Hong Kong Internet eXchange (HKIX).

Details of the cut are unknown except that it has been located and engineers have been deployed to fix it “hopefully” by the end of this week.

**Update:** The break was caused by Typhoon Soudelor, the most intense tropical cyclone to develop in the Northern Hemisphere in 2015, with severe impacts in the Northern Mariana Islands, Taiwan, and eastern China.

Telstra International operates the RNAL cable and has provided the APNIC community with an update. Telstra says despite the difficult weather conditions, repairs to the cable and network are progressing well although some maintenance is ongoing.

“Like many companies operating in the region, our subsea network near Taiwan was affected by Typhoon Soudelor. We were able to implement various measures, such as changing routing configurations, using alternate cable systems, and quickly mobilising repair ships, to get impacted customers back up and running in a short time frame, the majority in 48 hours.”

HKIX manager, and APNIC EC member, Che-Hoo Cheng, says the cut has decreased traffic routing through HKIX by around 10%.

“We’ve noticed a significant drop in traffic over the last week, which we believe is a result of the cut,” Che-Hoo says.

“Because of the cut, this traffic is being routed through longer, more congested pathways.”

HKIX is Hong Kong’s largest and most popular Internet Exchange, established and operated by The Chinese University of Hong Kong for 20 years. More than 230 Internet service and content providers are connected to HKIX.

The primary goal of HKIX is to interconnect ISPs in Hong Kong so that they can exchange intra-Hong Kong traffic locally without having to route traffic overseas.

“Because of our focus, we’ve always thought that 90% of our traffic was intra-Hong Kong. This latest drop by 10%, caused from one submarine cable being cut, makes us think that much more than 10% of our traffic is coming or going overseas,” Che-Hoo says.

“One of our participants that has been affected seriously is from Russia, meaning the cut is affecting more than the countries in the region.”

Submarine cable cuts are not uncommon for the region. Earlier this year, the Asia-America Gateway submarine cable system was cut in January and April, both times in the segment between Vietnam and Hong Kong.

Che-Hoo says these cuts were not as apparent as the recent break, and he hopes the cable will be fixed sooner rather than later to allow HKIX to break a record.

“Before the cut, we were close to breaking our traffic record because the new season of English Premier League had just started – a popular form of HKIX traffic. We expect to break the record when the cut is fixed,” he says.

More and more submarine cables are being rolled out each year. They are preferred over satellite connections because they allow for higher speed connection and lower latency.

The total carrying capacity of submarine cable between the USA and East Asia is in the terabits per second, while satellites typically offer only 1000 megabits per second.","The article discusses a significant incident involving a cut submarine cable in East Asia, specifically mentioning that engineers are fixing a cut in the Flag North Asian Loop/Reach North Asian Loop submarine cable.

It details the impact of the cut on internet traffic, noting a decrease in routing through the Hong Kong Internet Exchange (HKIX) by approximately 10%.

The article also explains that the cut was caused by Typhoon Soudelor and highlights the broader implications for internet connectivity in the region.

The concert is in London. You're watching it live from your home in Atlanta. What makes that possible is a network of subsea cables draped across the cold, dark contours of the ocean floor, transmitting sights and sounds at the speed of light through strands of glass fiber as thin as your hair but thousands of miles long.

These cables, only about as thick as a garden hose, are high-tech marvels. The fastest, the newly completed transatlantic cable called Amitié and funded by Microsoft, Meta and others, can carry 400 terabits of data per second. That's 400,000 times faster than your home broadband if you're lucky enough to have high-end gigabit service.

And yet subsea cables are low-tech, too, coated in tar and unspooled by ships employing basically the same process used in the 1850s to lay the first transatlantic telegraph cable. SubCom, a subsea-cable maker based in New Jersey, evolved from a rope manufacturer with a factory next to a deep-water port for easy loading onto ships.

Though satellite links are becoming more important with orbiting systems like SpaceX's Starlink, subsea cables are the workhorses of global commerce and communications, carrying more than 99% of traffic between continents. TeleGeography, an analyst firm that tracks the business, knows of 552 existing and planned subsea cables, and more are on the way as the internet spreads to every part of the globe and every corner of our lives.

You probably know that tech giants like Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google run the brains of the internet. They're called ""hyperscalers"" for operating hundreds of data centers packed with millions of servers. You might not know that they also increasingly run the internet's nervous system, too.

The first subsea cables spanned major communication routes like London to New York. Those remain critical, but newer routes are bringing bandwidth far off the beaten track: the west coast of Greenland, the volcanic island of St. Helena west of Africa, the southern tip of Chile, Pacific island nations, the 8,000-person town of Sitka, Alaska.

But as more internet traffic traverses subsea cables, there's also reason to worry about them. The explosive sabotage last year of the Nordstream 1 and 2 natural gas pipelines connecting Russia and Europe was much more logistically difficult than cutting an internet cable the thickness of your thumb. An ally of Russian leader Vladimir Putin said subsea cables are fair game for attack. Taiwan has 27 subsea cable connections that the Chinese military could see as tempting targets in an attack.

The risks are vivid: Vietnam's internet performance suffered thanks to outages on all five of its cables for months earlier this year, and the volcanic explosion on the island of Tonga severed it from most communications for weeks.

But those risks are dwarfed by the very real benefits, from the macroeconomic to the purely personal. The network is growing more reliable and capable with faster speeds and a surge in new cables extending the network beyond today's 870,000 miles of routes, and that'll coax more and more countries to join.

The owners of a fishing trawler which allegedly damaged an undersea fibre optics cable providing internet and telephone connection between Ireland and Britain are being sued in the High Court over the €800,000 cost of repairs.  
Virgin Media Wholesale Ltd is suing ""the owners and all persons claiming an interest"" in the MV The Lida Suzanna trawler over the alleged incident on January 26th, 2015, involving damage to the subsea cable stretching 219km between Dublin at Lytham St Anne's near Blackpool in England. The vessel was allegedly involved in scallop fishing which involves dredging the seabed.  
Virgin is seeking damages and a declaration that a maritime lien, or claim, attaches to the Irish-registered vessel which is based in Wexford. The defendants deny the vessel was responsible for causing damage to the cable and require proof of this. They contend that Virgin is the author of its own misfortune by not taking sufficient measures to bury or protect its cables.  
The court heard the cable was installed in 1998 by Virgin's predecessor NTL. It is one of two cables, the Sirius South and the Sirius North, running between Ireland and Britain. There have been 18 instances of damage involving trawlers since it was installed. Repairs were carried out by the repair ship, the Pierre de Fermat.  
The case continues before Mr. Justice Denis McDonald, with Virgin Media stating that they hope to recover the costs associated with repairing the cable and raise awareness of the consequences of damaging such infrastructure.","The article titled 'Fishing trawler allegedly caused €800,000 damage to Virgin Media's undersea cable' directly discusses an incident involving damage to an undersea cable caused by a fishing trawler.

In today’s interconnected world, the global flow of information relies heavily on an intricate network of underwater internet or submarine cables that crisscross the world’s oceans. These underwater internet cables, often invisible to the naked eye, facilitate data transmission, enabling internet connectivity, telecommunications, and international trade. The geopolitical implications surrounding these underwater infrastructure systems have become a focal point in discussions of national security, economic influence, and international relations.

**Submarine cables: The unsung heroes of global communication**

When we think of global communications, we often think of satellites, those high-tech marvels orbiting the Earth. But in reality, most of the world’s telecommunications traffic travels through a network of underwater cables, each about the size of a garden hose.

These cables carry an estimated 99% of all international data traffic, including our video calls, stock market transactions, and even military communications. They are the backbone of our interconnected world, making it possible to communicate instantly with people across the globe.

**The geopolitical significance of underwater internet cables**

Underwater cables hold immense strategic and economic value, making them a focal point of interest for nations worldwide. Their construction costs, reaching hundreds of millions of dollars, are outweighed by their unparalleled efficiency compared to satellite alternatives. However, the geopolitical implications surrounding these cables are substantial.

**Undersea cable battle: U.S. vs. China**

The United States and China are battling to control the undersea cables that carry most of the world’s internet traffic. The U.S. government is concerned about the potential for the Chinese spying on these cables and has been working to prevent Chinese companies from building them.

In one recent example, the U.S. government successfully intervened to prevent a Chinese company from building a cable connecting Singapore to France. The U.S. government did this by incentivising the consortium of companies funding the cable to choose an American company instead.

The U.S. government’s actions are part of a wider effort to rein in China’s growing influence in the technology sector. The U.S. government is concerned that China is using its technological prowess to gain a strategic advantage over the United States.

**The risk of espionage and sabotage**

Underwater cables are not only susceptible to geopolitical tensions but are also vulnerable to espionage and sabotage. Governments and intelligence agencies have been known to tap into these cables to intercept sensitive communications. Additionally, cables have been deliberately damaged, disrupting communications and potentially causing economic and security risks.","The article titled 'The Geopolitical Significance of Submarine Cables in Modern Communication Networks' discusses the importance and vulnerability of submarine cables extensively.

It specifically addresses the risk of espionage and sabotage in a dedicated section, noting that these cables can be deliberately damaged, which disrupts communications and poses economic and security risks.

**Phóng viên:** Thưa ông, đến thời điểm này, các cơ quan liên quan đã có thêm biện pháp gì để chấm dứt triệt để hành vi cắt trộm cáp quang biển?  
**Thứ trưởng Lê Nam Thắng:** Phó Thủ tướng Thường trực Chính phủ Nguyễn Sinh Hùng đã có ý kiến yêu cầu các ngành, các địa phương tăng cường nhiệm vụ này. Tuy nhiên, do thiếu ý thức, trong các ngày 22 và 23-5, vẫn xảy ra tình trạng cắt trộm mấy chục tấn cáp. Và mới đây là ngày 29-5, phát hiện vụ cắt trộm 100 tấn cáp. Hãng viễn thông Singapore (Singtel) có tuyến cáp quang biển chạy qua địa phận VN là EPCN cũng vừa thông báo đã bị cắt đứt 32 km cáp. Bộ Bưu chính – Viễn thông (BC-VT) đã có báo cáo Chính phủ về diễn biến phức tạp này để Chính phủ có ý kiến chỉ đạo quyết liệt các ngành, các cấp cấm mọi hành vi khai thác cáp quang biển và tăng cường giám sát, kiểm tra các tuyến cáp, xử lý nghiêm hành vi cắt trộm và tiêu thụ cáp quang...

Để việc ngăn chặn hiệu quả, trong tuần này hai thứ trưởng của Bộ BC-VT sẽ trực tiếp đi các tỉnh ven biển từ Đà Nẵng đến Cà Mau, đốc thúc các tỉnh đẩy mạnh tuyên truyền cho người dân hiểu về tác hại của việc cắt trộm cáp quang. Mặt khác, Bộ BC-VT cũng gửi bản đồ tuyến cáp cho các cơ quan chức năng để có biện pháp giám sát, bảo vệ. Hiện tại, ngoài hai tuyến cáp quang TVH, SMW-3 của Tập đoàn BC-VT VN (VNPT), còn có 7 tuyến cáp quang biển khác của nước ngoài chạy qua thềm lục địa VN là APCN, APCN2, APC, EAC, EAC2, C2C, Flag.

**Phóng viên:** Hiện tại doanh nghiệp (DN) mới thực hiện xây dựng tuyến cáp thứ ba (AGG), phải chăng là quá muộn, thưa ông?  
**Thứ trưởng Lê Nam Thắng:** Việc này rất khó, một tuyến cáp quang biển có giá trị đầu tư vài trăm triệu USD, do vậy một DN không thể tự làm mà phải hợp tác với đối tác từ các quốc gia khác. Bên cạnh đó, cáp quang biển nối nước này sang nước khác, do vậy bắt buộc phải hợp tác. Một tuyến cáp quang biển tối thiểu phải vài quốc gia hợp tác, thậm chí cả chục quốc gia cùng góp vốn xây dựng.

**Phóng viên:** Có thể ước tính chính xác thiệt hại từ việc cáp quang bị cắt trộm không, thưa ông?  
**Thứ trưởng Lê Nam Thắng:** Chưa thể thống kê chính xác thiệt hại, nhưng cũng tới hàng triệu USD. Còn nếu liên lạc bị ngưng trệ, VN bị cô lập thông tin khi tuyến cáp quang bị cắt thì thiệt hại không thể tính hết và rất lớn. Trong khi đó, người dân lại không hiểu rằng cáp quang phải mua từ nước ngoài với giá rất đắt nhưng khi bán phế liệu thì không được bao nhiêu tiền, vì chỉ có vỏ thép bên ngoài là bán được, còn lõi là sợi thủy tinh.

**Phóng viên:** Ông cho biết phải mất bao lâu để tuyến TVH nối thông và kinh phí sửa chữa là bao nhiêu?  
**Thứ trưởng Lê Nam Thắng:** Theo báo cáo của Công ty Viễn thông quốc tế (VTI) số cáp quang TVH bị cắt trộm khoảng 100 km, do vậy sớm nhất phải mất 3 tháng để nối thông tuyến. Sau khi VTI thống nhất được với công ty chuyên nối cáp, chúng tôi sẽ đề nghị các ngành chức năng cấp phép cho tàu vào hoạt động trong thời gian nhanh nhất. Tuy nhiên, việc này cần phải làm sớm bởi sắp đến mùa mưa bão.

The magnitude 9 earthquake which struck off the coast of Japan two weeks ago caused widespread destruction which has yet to be assessed properly. The tsunami which followed washed away entire towns and displaced hundreds of thousands of people. The death toll has risen to nearly 10,000 but there is at least another 13,000 missing and unaccounted for. Meanwhile engineers are battling to make safe the Fukushima nuclear reactor which was severely damaged and issued radioactive material over a large part of Japan, the risks of which are still being established. But the damage went beyond the shores of Japan with undersea telecommunications cables being severed.

The Internet is, by its very structure, fairly robust and routes traffic through different nodes should others fail. But much of the infrastructure is old and when major lines go down other parts of the system cannot cope with the extra traffic. It has meant that many parts of Asia have seen extremely slow Internet connection over the past two weeks.

**Internet disruption**

In Beijing and other cities across China many people began to see slow connections a few days after the quake. But the connection was not immediately made to the disaster which struck Japan. Chinese authorities often restrict the Internet, slowing traffic and blocking websites, so a reduction in the speed of the Internet was seen by some as a reaction to recent calls for a so-called Jasmine Revolution in China.

Internet services within China seemed to be less affected, but accessing websites based outside the country were fast becoming extremely unreliable. Expats in particular were beginning to notice problems. Comments on Twitter began to appear with users becoming exasperated. ""Chinese Internet is slow like molasses in Alaska. Worried that I'll not even get a radio feed for tomorrow's Timbers FC match,"" one Twitter user observed around a week after the quake. With apparent blocks of GMail by the Chinese government, most people assumed that the slow Internet was due to government action. Using a VPN, which directs traffic to foreign servers, did not help. VPNs have been targeted by Chinese authorities and so this was also assumed to be a cause of the problem. But it has gradually become clear that the slow Internet has more to do with damage to undersea cables.

**Repairs underway**

There have been relatively few reports concerning the damage inflicted on the Internet by the earthquake. But on Thursday 24th March The Shanghai Daily reported that the problems seen over the last two weeks were due, at least in part, by the damage done to telecommunications cables. The paper said it may take up to 45 days for services to return to normal however.

A joint repair operation is under way to fix submarine cables a Chinese cable company said. The team consisting of a repair ship carrying 50 Chinese and foreign technicians left Shanghai port on Thursday for waters near Taiwan. They will attempt to reconnect three of a dozen cables on the seafloor using a robot. Other damaged cables will be repaired at the same time by teams from South Korea and Japan.

The repair work has been delayed due to concerns over aftershocks, the cable company said. China's telecommunication authority said only a small number of users on the mainland were still affected by the damage. But the experience described by many users across China tells a different story.

According to the KDDI, a Japanese telecommunications firm, the operation to reconnect the cables will not be straightforward. Robots capable of diving to 2,500m have been deployed in order to fix the cables but it might take months to complete. Robots have never been used for repairing cables before, only deploying them, so the challenge is much greater.

**Extensive damage**

It is thought that over 150,000 circuits are currently offline, and mobile networks have also suffered in these cuts. Pacnet, a Hong Kong-based cable-network operator, estimates about half the cables running across the Pacific are damaged thus affecting connections to the US. Because of redundancy that has been put in place, connectivity is possible but in a degraded state which for many means a much slower connection.

Many telecom operators and users were reporting some disruptions to the Internet as early as Monday 14th March. Partial restoration of services was accomplished by re-routing traffic over undamaged cables and via satellites.

About half of the existing cables running across the Pacific are damaged and ""a lot of people are feeling a little bit of slowing down of Internet traffic going to the United States,"" said Bill Barney, chief executive of Pacnet. He declined to name the damaged cables operated by other companies, but said Pacnet's cable system connecting Japan to the US had not been damaged.

While the extent of the damage to undersea cables is still unclear and financial losses unknown, operators said they are undergoing an inspection and looking to expedite restoration. Pacnet aimed to repair two damaged segments of its East Asia Crossing network connecting Japan to other parts of Asia, like Taiwan and Hong Kong within five to seven days, Barney said. He played down concerns about any financial impact on Pacnet or regional telecom operators from the damaged cables. ""It's in our business plan that our cables will break, typically you get cuts in cables anywhere from five to 10 times a year,"" Barney said.

Several other companies also reported problems. The Japanese telecom operator KDDI said one of its undersea cables between Japan and the US had been damaged by the earthquake and was unable to transmit any signals. A spokesman said the company did not know if the cable was cut or having connection problems.

Identifying the problems may take some time as in some cases the damage is a long way off shore. KDDI said it was making efforts to identify and address the problem but added that services were beginning to recover after the quake.

Pacific Crossing, a unit of Japan's NTT Communications Corp. that operates a cable network between Japan and the US, also reported issues with its infrastructure. The Pacific Crossing PC-1 W and PC-1 N parts of its network remained out of service due to the earthquake, the company said.

NTT Communications said some of its services for enterprises were partially unavailable in Japan's Tohoku region, but that for submarine cables between Japan, other parts of Asia and the US the company was using backup cable routes. As regards its telephone services NTT say that it had restored 90% of its affected exchange offices some two weeks after the quake.

PCCW Ltd, which provides broadband Internet in Hong Kong, said Internet traffic to some international destinations, especially the US, were experiencing slower speeds due to several damaged cables that land in Japan, but it did not release details. In a statement PCCW said the affected cables would be repaired in ""the coming weeks.""

The Taiwan operator Chunghwa Telecom Co was one of the first to acknowledge problems with connectivity following the earthquake. On the same day an official said the earthquake had caused damage to an undersea cable near Kita on the eastern coast of Japan that belongs to the Asia Pacific Cable Network 2, owned by a consortium of 14 telecom operators led by AT&T.

China Telecom Corp, China's largest fixed-line operator by subscribers, was making emergency repairs to undersea cables damaged by the earthquake, Xinhua News Agency reported. The company said submarine fiber-optic cables connecting Japan and North America and a Pacific Crossing 1 cable near the city of Kitaibaraki, in Japan's northern Ibaraki Prefecture, were malfunctioning due to the earthquake.

Xinhua, citing an official from China Telecom, said the company had restored 65 gigabytes of outbound capacity, after the earthquake had disrupted 105 gigabytes of outbound Internet capacity and another 7 gigabytes of privately leased cable capacity.

Meanwhile China Mobile Ltd, the world's largest mobile carrier by accounts, said most of the company's services were operating normally despite a surge in calls to Japan, Xinhua reported. Another telecom operator China Unicom Ltd said most of its circuits had been repaired but cited connection problems with the network of Japan's NTT Communications.

Several companies said they avoided significant service disruptions by rerouting data traffic, including South Korean telecom operator KT Corp, which said a cable that is part of the Japan-US Cable Network was cut.

In the Philippines, Bayan Telecommunications Inc said the earthquake had disrupted some of its digital subscriber line services but said they would normalize services within a day.

Some operators were apparently unaffected by the disaster which befell the region. A spokeswoman for Australian operator Telstra Corp said none of the company's undersea cable infrastructure was damaged.

**Rolling blackouts**

In Japan itself the problems are further compounded.","The article titled 'Quake damaged cables slow Asia's net' discusses the severing of undersea telecommunications cables due to the earthquake off the coast of Japan.

It explicitly mentions the impact on internet connectivity in Asia, particularly noting slow connections in China as a consequence of the damaged cables.

The captain of a cable ship reveals all**

That the internet is physical can be hard to grasp. Few people have experienced this fact as viscerally as Guillaume Le Saux, captain of a ship named the Pierre de Fermat. It’s a state-of-the-art vessel that’s part of a fleet owned by French telecom company Orange, designed to lay and repair the optical fiber cables that criss-cross the world’s seabeds.

The life of a cable-ship captain is pretty intense. Le Saux is on constant alert, ready to be dispatched to the middle of an ocean with a couple of hours’ notice. This can sometimes mean sailing into 20-foot waves, receiving ransoms, or fixing up a shark’s chew toy.

When Le Saux arrives at the appointed spot at sea, he and his crew deploy Hector, the ship’s seven ton underwater robot, which will travel to the seabed, sometimes at depths of 5,000 meters. Hector’s job is to inspect the damage, bury newly laid cable on the sea-floor, or help bring damaged sections up to the ship’s jointing room, all controlled from the ship’s deck.

On the day we meet, the Pierre de Fermat is anchored at Portland port, a commercial port on England’s south coast on the English Channel. It has just weathered a rough night at sea traveling from Brest in northern France. It’s a rare opportunity to board the ship, which is difficult to pin down because of its rapid deployments, and Orange’s PR team has arranged for a tour of the 80-person capacity vessel with just a couple of days’ notice.

Getting on the ship requires walking up an aluminum gangplank nearly three stories high. On board, the crew is enjoying a lunch with wine, which is only allowed on Thursdays and Sundays. Below deck, I watch two kilometers of submarine cable being loaded into one of the ship’s nearly three-stories-high tanks. They have to be guided into place by hand by a team of six workers. Previous attempts to use mechanized means of loading and coiling have proved less efficient, Le Saux explained.

Once the cable was loaded, the Pierre de Fermat would embark on a three-week-long mission in the North Sea to repair British Telecom cables connecting the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The ship was just hours away from departing when I spoke to Le Saux about life at sea safeguarding the world’s data links in the most literal way possible, in an age of wireless data transfer and the rise of the cloud.

**Quartz: Is it true that sharks attack submarine cables?**

Guillaume Le Saux: It’s true, but it’s very rare. It’s not very often. Sharks can smell the electricity, the electro-magnetic radiation, and because they seem to be very curious, they try to bite the cable. When the water is warm, it depends on the area, we have some specific cable protected with a sort of aluminum sheet to avoid the radiation being sensed by sharks and this cable is known as the “fish bite” cable. They cannot feel the electro-magnetic radiation so they don’t see the cable.

**What about whales?**

No, They cannot bite it or hurt it, because the cable is laid on the seabed. So we cannot imagine whales passing under the cable for example.

**Are cables laid on the seabed even in the deepest parts of the ocean?**

When engineers prepare the cabling operation, they try to determine the best way for the cable to go on the seabed in order not to consume too much cable. They try to avoid the area with a lot of undersea mountains, for example. But if you have to go from Europe to the United States, you have to pass through the middle of the Atlantic, you will have to pass through a 5,000 meter water depth. At any time, the cable is lying on the seabed. It’s part of our job to ensure the ship is traveling at a good speed of five to six knots, to lay the cable, to be sure the cable is laying on the seabed.

**What are some of the security measures in place around these cables?**

The cables are very strategic. It’s very important for communications in all countries. So most of the time, countries where we lay the cable are involved also in the protection of this cable. So it’s in our interest, it’s in their interest, that the cable is protected.

One of the most important parts of the job is when we send the cable to the beach. The ship arrives close to the beach and we send the cable to the beach. We have some police to prevent everybody crowding around the cable. But from time to time, somebody tries to steal the cable, to break it.

**Has this happened to you before?**

In Indonesia, yeah, but it’s not very often. It’s very rare that the cable is cut intentionally.

We were laying the cable, we did the shore-end, so we sent the cable to the beach, and then we left to start the cabling operation. Some fishermen arrived, they picked up the cable from the beach, they picked up 200 meters of cable, coiled it on their small little fishing boat, they took a picture, they sent it to us, and they asked for ransom. The cable wasn’t active, so we repaired the cable. We cannot imagine that we pay a ransom to anybody trying to steal the cable.

**That’s the policy?**

Yes.

**Your job is repairing cables. How do they get damaged?**  

The cables are damaged, maybe 80% of the time, due to human activities. Of the 80% of human activities, you have maybe 80% fishing activities. Most of the time it’s a trawler trawling the seabed. These are big trawlers, for example, in the North Sea, the capacity of the trawler is like if a trawler towed two London buses on the seabed, to give you a sort of a picture. They tow two London buses on the seabed, so it’s very aggressive for the seabed and for the cable also.

You have also the anchor. When you are approaching a harbor, some vessels are anchoring, they can damage the cable it’s the remaining 20% of human activities. It’s not so rare, because sometimes a ship’s captain, like me, make some mistake, drops anchor at the wrong position. Some countries in Africa, the anchor area is in the cable zone. Sometimes you have some typhoon, tempest, hurricane; the ship drops anchor, the ship moves and catches the cable. So it’s not so rare, it’s quite common.

The other damage is from earth activity, for example, years ago, you have the tsunami in Asia, some cable ships worked for months and months to repair the cables on the seabed.

**How much notice do you get before you have to sail to a repair spot?**  

The contract for us, we are at 24-hour notice to leave the base-port to repair a cable. Most part of the time, [a cable owner] needs only a few hours to detect a fault in a cable. So the cable owner phones the hotline for us, we mobilize the ship and we sail. We have to sail in less than 24 hours, and for the most part of the time, we are 24 to 48 hours away, from the base-port to the cable area.

**How did you end up in this line of work?**  

I’ve spent four and a half years as captain. But before that I was chief officer, I was also chief engineer, I was also mate, so it’s about 16 years now I am in this job. I arrived in the industry as a cadet, mate, and I’ve spent all my career on a cable ship basically.

**How has the industry changed in those 16 years?**

Concentration of companies, less activity because the cables are now larger capacity. So when you install a cable, you have a lot of capacity, so you don’t have to lay too much cable. Yes, it has changed. Now it’s developed by other people, for example, the Chinese now have cable ships. Fifteen years ago they don’t have any cable ships.

**Do you think we’ll end up at a point where we don’t need cables for the internet?**  

I’m quite sure, no. We will always need cables. Because it’s a huge capacity, it’s less expensive than satellite, so I think we always need cables.

**And how’s your internet on this ship?**

Poor! (laughs) Because we don’t have internet from the cable! We have internet from satellite.","The article discusses submarine cables extensively, including their installation, repair, and the challenges they face, particularly from human activities such as fishing.

It mentions that 80% of cable damage is due to human activities, which directly relates to the topic of cut sea cables.

The captain's insights into the importance of these cables for global communications further emphasize the relevance of the topic.

Vietnam's fiber optic connections to the rest of the world have been dropping …
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vietnamese fishermen have accidentally cut off nearly all of Vietnam's communications connection to the outside world, according to [Reuters](http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070607/wr_nm/vietnam_cable_dc). Hired to pull up obsolete copper wiring from the ocean floor, the fishermen apparently grabbed active optical cabling as well.

The incident started a year ago when Vietnamese province Ba Ria-Vung Tau authorized fisherman to rip up undersea copper lines that were laid before 1975. They had planned to sell the copper as scrap. What the local government did not realize was that the fishermen weren't able to tell the difference between copper lines and fiber optic lines, therefore taking roughly 43 km of fiber optic cable—over half of it belonging to a company in Singapore. One Vietnamese newspaper reported that a 11 km section of the cable that transmits data to Thailand and Hong Kong would cost $5.8 million to replace.

""The general assessment is that most fishermen, and in some cases even the local authorities, had a very simple understanding of the consequences of the theft of under-sea fibre optic cable,"" wrote Vietnam's Ministry of Posts and Telematics in a report seen by Reuters. The Ministry has launched a campaign to ""educate"" fishermen about the cables, and permission to salvage the copper has been revoked.

Vietnamese newspaper _Thanh Nien_ reported that the fishermen have left Vietnam dangling on its last lifeline: ""Now just one undersea cable connects Vietnam with the outside world.""","The article discusses the accidental severing of fiber optic cables by fishermen in Vietnam, which is a direct reference to the topic of cut sea cables.

It mentions the cutting of 'fiber optic cables' and the implications for Vietnam's communication infrastructure, stating that it left the country with only one undersea cable connecting it to the outside world.

This incident is treated as a central theme in the article, emphasizing the significant impact on telecommunications.

"Challenges in Deepwater Cable and Pipeline Burial","Addresses 95% of subsea cable failures caused by fishing, emphasizing effective burial techniques for protection.","https://onepetro.org/OTCONF/proceedings/01OTC/All-01OTC/Houston,%20Texas/34122","","",Yes,"Mark Finch","Richardson, Texas, United States",-,"2001-05-01","English","Coflexip Stena Offshore","**Title:** Meeting the Challenges of Deepwater Cable and Pipeline Burial  
**Abstract:** Cables and pipelines are buried in deepwater to provide thermal insulation, on-bottom stability and physical protection. In the soft soils associated with deepwater regions cable ploughs and ROV based jet trenchers are the tools of choice. The Offshore Engineering Division of the Coflexip Stena Offshore (CSO) Group and Perry Slingsby Systems have contributed significantly to the development of deepwater cable and pipeline burial systems. Significant resources continue to be allocated to geotechnical research programmes to support product developments. This paper discusses the key technical issues with respect to deepwater cable and pipeline burial. The state-of-the-art of geotechnical engineering and research, and its application to new burial product developments, is also presented.  

**Introduction:** It is now common for telecommunications cables to be buried across the world's continental shelves in water depths up to 1,500m. Such burial is primarily to provide physical protection against fishing and shipping activity, and on-bottom stability against environmental forces. Traditionally, burial of subsea cables has been achieved by simultaneous lay and trench using a cable plough pulled by the cable installation vessel. As such the installation speed of the cable is governed by the rate of burial, not the rate of cable lay. As a result there is a growing desire to de-couple cable lay from burial, i.e. use a separate vessel and/or tool to bury the product post-lay. This has led to technical issues for both subsea ploughing and jetting, which may be able to provide an alternative to ploughing in some circumstances. Proposed oil and gas developments, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, offshore West Africa and Brazil, are now commonplace between 1,000 and 2,000 metres of water, with plans for 3,000 metres plus being discussed in the industry. It is well known that the requirements for pipeline burial change as water depth increases.  

**Deepwater Cable Burial:** Ever since the first two transatlantic telecommunication cables were installed by AT&T Submarine Systems in the late 1950's, the need for protection of subsea cables has been understood. It was quickly recognised that the sections of cable on the continental shelves were most at risk from fishing and shipping activity. It has been estimated that up to 95% of all subsea cables failures can be directly attributable to fishing activities.","The article titled 'Meeting the Challenges of Deepwater Cable and Pipeline Burial' discusses the burial of subsea cables primarily to provide protection against fishing and shipping activities, which are significant threats leading to cable failures.

It states that up to 95% of subsea cable failures can be attributed to fishing activities, highlighting the risks of cut cables.

This indicates that while the article does not directly mention 'cut sea cables' in those exact words, it extensively discusses the implications and protective measures related to subsea cables, treating the topic as a central theme.

The focus on protecting cables from external threats aligns well with the criterion regarding cut sea cables."
"Exploring Underwater Cable Operations on the Repair Ship","Insights into undersea cable repair operations, detailing causes of damage and their impact on global internet connectivity.","https://www.wired.co.uk/article/subsea-internet-cable-ship-boat","2023-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","Condé Nast; Matt Burgess",Yes,"Matt Burgess","London, England, GB","1500000","2023-02-27","English","Condé Nast","Onboard the Pierre de Fermat, internet connectivity is limited. To get online sailors must visit a designated internet cabin to surf the web via a satellite uplink. Yet, this ship and the 80-person crew is an essential part of the internet's sprawling infrastructure: it repairs the vast network of undersea cables connecting the continents.

Running along the seabed are thousands of miles of high capacity, data-transporting pipes. From Malaysia to South Africa and Greenland to Canada, the fibres (literally and digitally) connect the world. When the cables break - caused by sharks, earthquakes and, most commonly, boats - it's the job of the Pierre de Fermat, of Orange Marine, and other similar vessels to reconnect them.

For every journey, bad weather, pirates, and deep murky waters stand in the way of a successful splicing.

As WIRED visits the ship, it's docked in Weymouth, South England, and is reloading in preparation for a job. ""Where we're going now, in the North Sea, we will have three or four days to fix the cable"" the captain, Guillaume Le Saux, tells WIRED. He's been in charge of submarine cable-fixing boats for almost a decade.

At the heart of Le Saux's boat is its cable, but in an age of machinery and automation, loading it is a decidedly manual task. Spooling from a warehouse – in this case owned by BT – on the side of the dock, the cable snakes its way onto the boat through a number of guiding loops and is fed through the ship until it reaches its core. At each stage it is overseen by watchful crew members.

The entirety of the 100-metre-long ship, which was completed and made its maiden voyage in 2014, is structured around its cable store room. With a capacity of 9,000km (5,592 miles) of cable, the central room (cable tongue) is filled by hand. For its 20-day journey into the North Sea, the boat is being restocked with just 9km (5.5 miles) of undersea connections, a feat that takes several hours to load.

Seven men are required in the cabling room to physically grab and guide the cable around the outside of the room. On the deck above them, more engineers feed the cable through the boat and inspect its internal fibres. Before the Pierre de Fermat sets sail it must ensure the cable is operational; the onboard crew physically cut the cable with a Stanley knife blade to inspect and then test its data-carrying capability. Willy Poulain, the ship's engineering leading, says onboard generators can produce 10,000 volts that are passed through a cable to ensure it is up to the job of transporting some of the world's internet traffic.

The process of reloading the ship is the start of its journey. Once it has navigated to the area of a reported cable disruption, the real work begins. The crew then have to find the damaged or broken cable. ""Localisation of the fault is the hardest,"" says Poulain. For this, the ship's onboard giant robot is called upon.

Hector, a giant remotely-operated vehicle, is lowered to the sea floor (the bot's maximum depth is 2,000m) to retrieve the broken cable. The nine-tonne robot uses onboard cameras and claws, that are controlled by the crew, to grab the internet pipe from its location. ""If we can't find the cable, most of the time it has been moved by a boat or displaced,"" Le Saux explains.

The breaks happen surprisingly frequently. ""There's a cable fault somewhere in the world twice a week,"" Tim Stronge, vice president of Telegeography, which creates giant undersea cable maps, tells WIRED. He says the majority of cable breaks are caused by humans and happen in fishing areas where boats and trawlers accidentally snag or rip the light-carrying cables open. Although Stronge says it is not unheard of for storms and underwater earthquakes to cause faults.

For Le Saux, there are other things to worry about. Over lunch – those aboard the Pierre de Fermat can only have alcohol on Thursdays and Sundays – he says pirates have attacked boats in the past and he has seen thieves stealing parts of the cables that connect to land. (""It was from the beach side,"" he says. ""The cable was not in service."") There's also the problem of animals in the sea: ""We have seen shark bites in the cables in the past. When we have seen that we try to protect the cable with a metal tube.""

All the elements add to a challenging job of repairing the subsea cables. Stronge adds: ""There are actually a lot of cable breaks off the coast of the UK as well, as that's a heavily fished area. You don't hear about that so much as there are so many cables."" Most cable breaks don't have much of an impact on the general availability of the internet. The largest countries connected to the internet are online through a number of cables and when one does get taken offline, the traffic is re-routed. However, in 2008, severed cables caused internet disruption for 70 per cent of the nationwide network in Egypt and India had 60 per cent of its networks disrupted.

Onboard the Orange Marine ship when a cable is retrieved by Hector, specialist teams of engineers are set to work. Within a repair room (which feels like a scientific laboratory) engineers lay the cable across two work benches and fix broken areas. They often add a new section of cable into the area which is broken or frayed. The process hasn't changed much in recent years, Poulain says. And nor is it likely to going forward.

""Where the technology will improve is in the factories and from the providers of the cables. The fibres are very high performance and the improvement is in the evolution of the fibres.""

The internet may feel like an invisible, instant force connecting the world, but behind it lies a vast infrastructure that resembles the human body’s circulatory system. In this analogy, undersea fiber optic cables act as the main arteries of the global internet, moving vast amounts of data across oceans much like arteries pump blood through the body. Data centers are akin to organs, processing and managing the data before sending it out. Meanwhile, cable landing stations are the capillaries that connect the cables to the local data centers, and just like in the human body, each component plays a critical role in keeping the whole system functioning.

**The Undersea Fiber Cables: The Arteries of the Internet**  
Just as arteries are the main highways for blood circulation, undersea fiber optic cables are the primary paths that data takes as it flows between continents. These cables stretch for thousands of miles across the ocean floor, transporting data in the form of light signals at incredible speeds. This “data blood” powers everything from email to video streaming, allowing for seamless global communication.  
Similar to how arteries have the crucial job of carrying oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body, undersea cables carry the vast majority of the world’s internet traffic (over 99%) between countries. Without these arteries, the internet as we know it would not function effectively, and large-scale communication between continents would be drastically slower.

**Cable Landing Stations: The Internet’s Capillaries**  
As blood flows through arteries and eventually reaches smaller capillaries that connect it to organs and tissues, data traveling through undersea cables reaches cable landing stations. These stations act as the “capillary” network of the internet, linking the massive undersea arteries to the terrestrial fiber networks on land.  
Once data arrives at a landing station, it is handed off to the local infrastructure, where smaller fiber optic cables route it to local data centers, cities, or even directly to businesses and homes. This is similar to how capillaries deliver nutrients and oxygen from the bloodstream to tissues throughout the body.

**Data Centers: The Organs of the Internet**  
Just as organs process and regulate what the body needs, data centers serve as critical processing hubs for the global internet. They manage, store, and distribute the data that flows through the network, ensuring that websites load, cloud applications function, and data is delivered to users efficiently.  
When data travels across the world, it doesn’t just pass through undersea arteries without processing—it needs to be stored and analyzed. Data centers take the “nutrients” (data) from the internet arteries and process them into usable information, much like organs process the oxygen and nutrients carried in the bloodstream to fuel the body.

Imagine you’re streaming a movie from a service like Netflix. The movie file is stored in a data center, where it is processed and prepared for delivery. Just like the liver processes nutrients from the blood, the data center processes the information, making it ready to be sent to your device through the internet’s vast network of fibers.

**How Data Flows: The Journey of Blood and Data**  
Let’s follow the flow of data, paralleling it to the body’s circulation of blood:

**Data Creation – The Spark**  
When you request something from the internet, like accessing a video on YouTube, it’s like the heart sending out a signal. Your device sends a data packet to a nearby data center, acting as the heart’s first beat, starting the journey.

**Initial Data Transfer to Local Network (Arteries)**  
This data is sent to a local data center through terrestrial fiber cables, much like the way blood is pumped through major arteries to reach different parts of the body. The data center either handles the request or forwards it along to another part of the world if the content is hosted in a different location.

**Connecting to an Undersea Cable (Main Arteries)**  
If your request needs to travel across the ocean, it enters the undersea cable network at a cable landing station, just like blood flows through the body’s largest arteries. These undersea cables then carry the data to its destination—another country, or even another continent—spanning thousands of miles under the sea.

**Signal Amplification (Arterial Pressure Boosters)**  
Along the way, the signal is boosted by repeater stations along the cable, akin to how the heart’s strong contractions keep blood moving through arteries, ensuring it reaches even distant parts of the body.

**Arriving at Another Cable Landing Station (Capillary Network)**  
Once the data reaches the opposite side of the ocean, it arrives at another cable landing station. From there, it flows into the local terrestrial fiber network, just as blood transitions from arteries into capillaries to nourish tissues.

**Processing at a Foreign Data Center (Organ Processing)**  
The data arrives at the relevant data center—think of it as an organ—where it is processed, stored, or forwarded on for delivery. If you’re streaming a movie, for example, the data center will retrieve the file, break it into smaller data packets, and prepare it for the return journey to your device.

**Returning to Your Device (Veins Returning Blood)**  
Once the data has been processed and packaged, it’s sent back through the same network, crossing the undersea arteries, landing stations, and local fiber networks until it reaches your device. Just like veins return blood to the heart, data travels back through the network, completing the cycle.

**The Symbiotic Relationship**  
In both the human body and the internet, every part of the system is crucial for proper functioning. The undersea cables (arteries), cable landing stations (capillaries), and data centers (organs) all rely on one another to ensure smooth data flow across the world. If one part of the network fails—whether it’s a severed undersea cable or an overloaded data center—the whole system can be affected, just like a blockage in an artery could disrupt blood flow to an organ.

**Challenges and Future of the Internet’s Arteries**  
Just as the body’s arteries can face issues like blockages or injury, the undersea fiber cables are vulnerable to damage from external forces such as ship anchors, earthquakes, or even marine life. For example, in 2008, a severed cable in the Mediterranean Sea caused widespread internet outages across the Middle East and South Asia, akin to a sudden blockage cutting off blood flow.

To protect against such risks, redundancy is built into the system. Multiple cables and landing stations ensure that if one route is damaged, the data can be rerouted, much like how the body has multiple blood vessels to maintain circulation in case of injury.

As the demand for data continues to grow with the rise of artificial intelligence, cloud services, and 5G technology, the arteries of the internet are expanding. New undersea cables are being laid, and data centers are becoming more powerful, much like how the body’s circulatory system adapts to the demands of physical growth and increased activity.

**Conclusion**  
Undersea fiber cables are the arteries of the internet, allowing data to flow freely across continents just as blood circulates through the body. Cable landing stations act as the capillary network, connecting these arteries to data centers, which process and distribute the data, much like organs nourish the body.

This complex, global network ensures that every website you visit, every video you stream, and every message you send can travel across the world in the blink of an eye. Without this infrastructure, our modern internet—like the human body without a circulatory system—would simply not function.","The article 'How Undersea Fiber Cables Power the Global Internet: The Internet’s Arteries' discusses undersea cables extensively, treating them as critical components of internet infrastructure.

It includes a significant discussion on the vulnerabilities of these cables, specifically mentioning that they can be damaged by external forces, with a notable example from 2008 where a severed cable caused widespread outages in the Middle East and South Asia.

This indicates that the topic of cut sea cables is central to the discussion, aligning with the criterion's requirements for direct mentions and contextual implications regarding the impact on internet connectivity."
"Vietnam Faces Internet Shutdown After Cable Theft","90% of Vietnam's international internet traffic at risk due to theft of 100 kilometers of fiber optic cables.","http://texyt.com/vietnam+internet+cable+stolen+by+thieves+00096","2023-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","",Yes,"Texyt Staff",-,"5000","2023-02-07","English","Texyt Ltd","Vietnam faces near total disconnection from the Internet because thieves are stealing the country's international telecoms cables, says a telecoms executive.

After a gang carted off fiber optic lines earlier this month, the country now relies on a single link to Hong Kong for 90 percent of its international internet and telephone traffic, warned Nguyen Huu Khanh.

Nguyen is the director of the government-controlled Vietnam Telecom International (VTI) company, which operates the international links.

Almost 100 kilometers of cable have been stolen, Nguyen told local publication Tuoi Tre. A summary of Tuoi Tre's coverage was reported by the state-owned VietNamNet Online Newspaper. Nguyen estimated losses at more than $4 million. Other reports say the cables will take three months to fix.

Police have recovered parts of the stolen cable, but it is severely damaged because the thieves sliced it into sections for easier handling.

### Fishing boats used to hook cables

The thieves used fishing boats to pull up cables which connect Vietnam to Thailand, where they merge with global telecoms networks. The undersea lines usually lie unprotected on top of the seabed in offshore areas, and can easily be dragged to the surface if they can be located.

In many regions, large signposts indicate where an international undersea cable comes ashore. Although these are intended to prevent accidental damage to the cable, they also act as a convenient guide for thieves. The stolen cables can be sold for tens of thousands of dollars as scrap.

### Several cable gangs at work, police say  

The Thailand cable is not the first to go missing. Since the beginning of the year, 500 tons of fiber optic cable may have been stolen in five separate incidents, according to police sources.

In one such incident, the crew of a Singaporean cable repair ship sent to investigate a connection problem arrived to find a Vietnamese boat making off with a large section of the cable.

Vietnam's sole remaining high-capacity international cable is part of a network that was severely damaged by an earthquake last year, taking months to repair. Even if the thieves do not turn their attention to that cable, a further quake will effectively cut most Vietnamese off from the global internet, Nguyen warned.

While Vietnam's international internet links have long suffered from a lack of bandwidth, local bloggers have been complaining of particularly poor connections in recent weeks, possibly as a result of the missing cables.

Update June 1: Government officials have called for prison sentences or even the death penalty for cable thieves, according to a report carried by VietNamNet.","The article titled ""Vietnam unplugged – country faces internet shutdown after cables stolen"" discusses the theft of international telecom cables, specifically mentioning that almost 100 kilometers of fiber optic cables have been stolen.

It explains that these cables are crucial for Vietnam's internet connectivity, as the country now relies on a single link to Hong Kong for 90% of its international internet traffic.

The article describes the methods used by thieves, including using fishing boats to pull up undersea cables, and discusses the implications of these thefts on Vietnam's telecommunications infrastructure.

This aligns with the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables, as it directly addresses the theft and impact of undersea cables on internet connectivity."

A segment of the Asia-Pacific Cable Network 2 (APCN2) undersea cable network between China and Taiwan suffered a serious cable fault on Wednesday, causing Internet traffic to be rerouted onto other undersea cables and slowing Internet access for some users in Southeast Asia.

At about 10:50 a.m. on Wednesday, local time, an alarm signaled a cable fault on Segment 7 of APCN2, which connects Hong Kong and Shantou, China. The disruption caused a temporary loss of service on the undersea link but all customers that use the cable were soon shifted to capacity on other cables, according to a source familiar with the situation.

The APCN2 cable is owned by a consortium of 26 telecom operators from 14 different countries. The cable links Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, South Korea and Japan.

The exact cause of the APCN2 fault was not immediately known. The alarm indicated the disruption was caused by a ""single point of failure,"" which suggests a variety of possibilities, including a technical failure or a cable cut, the source said.

The incident was likely the main reason that Internet access appeared slower for some users in Singapore on Wednesday, the source said.

Undersea cables are used to transport much of the world's Internet traffic and can be easily damaged by natural disasters or other causes. In 2006, a powerful earthquake off the southern coast of Taiwan damaged several cables and slowed Internet access to a crawl for users in Southeast Asia.

Singapore Telecommunications (SingTel), which is an investor in APCN2, said its users may experience slower Internet access than normal to some U.S. Web sites, blaming the APCN2 fault on damage caused by Typhoon Morakot.

""The [APCN2] consortium members have started restoration works, and our engineers are in the process of diverting Internet traffic to other cable systems. We expect the situation to return to acceptable levels within the next 24 hours,"" SingTel spokesman Chia Boon Chong, said in an e-mail statement.

A spokesman for Starhub, another Singapore ISP that holds a stake in the cable, did not return a phone call seeking comment.

The fault that hit APCN2 on Wednesday follows two other service disruptions that recently hit the network. One disruption affected APCN2 Segment 7, between Hong Kong and Taiwan, and the other affected APCN2 Segment 1, which connects Singapore and Malaysia. However, both of these disruptions were deemed to be ""relatively minor"" compared to the disruption that took place Wednesday morning, the source said.

The cause of the two earlier faults on APCN2 was not immediately clear.

APCN2 isn't the only Asian undersea cable currently suffering from a service disruption.

""The Cable & Wireless Real Time Operations Team have logged multiple cable breaks on APCN2, APCN, EAC and SMW3 in Asia Pacific -- specifically, near Taiwan. Network traffic flow has been adversely affected in and out of the region as a result,"" said Gavin Tait, director of Asia network planning and implementation at Cable & Wireless, in an e-mail statement provided by the company.

None of Cable & Wireless customers were affected by these failures, he said.

Efforts are currently underway to repair the East Asia Crossing (EAC) undersea cable after it experienced ""double faults"" off the coast of Taiwan last weekend, according to Roland Lim, a spokesman for Pacnet, which owns EAC.

The first sign of damage to the EAC cable off the coast of Taiwan came on Aug. 9 at 1:37 a.m., local time, when an alarm signalled that service on EAC Segment D, which links Taiwan and Hong Kong, had been disrupted, Pacnet said in an Aug. 10 Network Event Notification that was obtained by IDG News Service. At the time, traffic on Segment D was transferred to EAC Segment C. However, Segment C suffered a second disruption roughly twelve hours later.

The cause of the faults that hit the EAC cable between Hong Kong and Taiwan is not yet known, but the damage happened at about the same time the southern part of the island and China's southern coast was being pummeled by one of the most powerful typhoons to strike in recent memory. There were no earthquakes recorded by Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau at the time when the disruptions took place.","The article discusses a serious cable fault in the Asia-Pacific Cable Network 2, specifically mentioning that a segment of the undersea cable network experienced a fault that caused Internet traffic to be rerouted and slowed access for users in Southeast Asia.

It details the implications of the fault on Internet connectivity and discusses the possibility of a cable cut as a cause of the disruption.

While some may say not having Facebook for a few hours is a positive thing, this was more than that, called “an absolute disaster . . . a national crisis.” It cut off not just social media, but email, cell phone service, financial transactions, business, and government communications.

It's still not clear what caused the breakage, but it was fixed about two weeks later.

And then, in 2022, it happened again. Only this time, it was worse.

You may recall seeing news on the Tonga volcano eruption and tsunami that left at least 6 dead, 19 injured, and others reported missing, with $90.4 million in damages. Besides bearing a devastating natural disaster, the people in Tonga lost their main connection to the outside world.

We can certainly understand why a volcanic eruption hundreds of times more powerful than the atomic bomb would take out a transpacific fiber optic cable, but it also underscores the fragility of our digital lives.

### A Brief History

In a way, the whole idea of laying a cable on the bottom of the ocean floor almost sounds like science fiction. How does a cable thousands of miles long even get made? How do they get it on the boat? How do they lay it on the ocean floor?

Cable breakages on land are bad enough, with everything from construction equipment, fires, even vandalism disrupting the fiber optics. But land “interruptions” are relatively easy to fix. How do they get repaired 25,000 feet (about 7.62 kilometers) underwater?

Communication cables laid on the ocean floor were not created when the Internet came along. The first “submarine cable” was dropped into the water in 1858, but only lasted about three weeks. It was attempted again in 1866, and worked, sending telegraph signals across the Atlantic. Telephone communications (i.e., AT&T) used underwater cables beginning in 1956 and the Internet started utilizing them in 1988.

Today, some estimates say there are 550,000 miles (about 885,000 kilometers) of transoceanic fiber optic cables, while others claim 750,000. That’s like stringing a line from the moon and back twice. Whatever the actual number, it is a lot, which means “The Cloud” is not really in the sky, but 5 miles underwater.

The cable itself is just a little bit more complex than its land-locked cousin. A “standard” fiber optic cable has a core, a cladding layer, and is usually coated with acrylate polymer or polyamide. There could be more layers of protection, depending on the application. Inside all of that is the optical fiber which carries the light. A submarine cable resting on the bottom of the ocean has more layers to protect it than a land-based one, like a scuba diver wears more than just a swimming suit.

_A cross section of the shore-end of a modern submarine communications cable._

Despite all this protection, an underwater cable can be damaged not just by volcanoes and tsunamis, but earthquakes, storm currents, ship anchors, and fishing trawlers. Even sharks looking for a snack.

Politics get involved as well, with both transoceanic cables and pipelines being sabotaged or blown up over governmental agendas and spats.

### How The Cables Are Made

As for the manufacturing process of undersea cables . . . yes, it is a big process. The cables are fed into a high-speed mill the size of a jet engine, put in a copper casing that may have plastic, steel or aluminum and even tar added to protect it from the elements.

You may think the end-product is fat and big, but it’s about as big as a larger-size garden hose. And the cable is designed to last 25 years if not subjected to volcanoes, earthquakes, or fishing trawlers.

The planning of where the cable is laid in the ocean takes at least a year so they can arrange its course miles underwater, where the seabed has been charted but a little unpredictable. After all, there are both trenches and mountains down there.

### Implementing The Fiber Optic Cable

Alcatel Submarine Networks (a part of Nokia) has more than 700,000 kilometers (435,000 miles) of optical submarine systems deployed worldwide (enough to circumnavigate the globe 16 times). One of the ships used to deploy the cable is about 450 feet long and can have as many as 80 crew members, with teams working in two 12-hour shifts. Although they have plenty of food for their long journey (two months or more), alcohol is not allowed. That’s for the better since the seas can be rough, sometimes so bad the captain may order operations to stop, cut the cable and find safe waters. Before cutting the cable, they tie a buoy to it so they can find it when they return.

Of course, the ship does not carry enough cable to span the whole ocean, so it is done in segments. The ship can carry up to 4,000 miles (about 6437.38 km) and it can take a month for the gigantic tanks (where the cable is stored) to be fully loaded.

A special subsea plow is used to trough and bury submarine cables along the seabed closer to shorelines where things like anchoring and fishing are most prevalent and could damage submarine cables.

Out at sea, the cable is unspooled into the water, attached to several buoys temporarily so it doesn’t sink to the bottom too soon. Once out far enough, the buoys are removed and the cable sinks to the ocean floor. This is repeated over and over.

Those of you who are thinking “Wait a minute! The light in fiber optics can only go so far before it loses strength — how can a cable traveling thousands and thousands of miles keep the signal alive?”

Repeaters placed every 60-70 kilometers — about 40 miles.

### The Technology of Submarine Cable

Power to the repeater is fed from power feeding equipment, which is located in Submarine Cable Station. In traditional submarine cables, every fiber pair will have their own repeaters, and four fiber pairs will have a repeater with a four-amplifier chassis. One amplifier chassis has dual laser 980nm pump units. This is called 2x2 Pump redundancy, the type of redundancy scheme used in the past.

Now they use 4x2 redundancies, improving reliability by using additional 2 pump lasers compared to the 2x2 pump redundancies. Two EDFA’s share the power from four pump lasers, which can tolerate three-pump laser failure at most in each fiber pair.

The submarine cables use DWDM (Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing) so the data capacity is maximized at hundreds of Gbps (gigabits per second). The cables also employ optical amplifiers (a.k.a. repeaters) that boost the signals across each cable section.

So, yes, laying a cable from, say, Oregon to Japan is quite complicated and time-consuming to say the least.

### From Land to Sea to Land

Once the cable (or more accurately, series of cables) reaches its land-based destination, it is connected to submarine line terminal (SLTE) and power feed equipment (PFE) installed at a cable landing station. The PFE can be installed at a cable landing station, while at another inland location — such as a data center or central office — the SLTE is set in place.

Broadband speeds are expected to be slower as a result and cable owners JT, Sure and BT say it could take up to three weeks to repair.

Telecom company JT says engineers have been dispatched to repair the cables.

Jersey's coastguard says there will be an investigation to see if the ship dropped anchor in a banned area.

Master Pilot Peter Moore said the boat, believed to be the King Arthur, anchored north of Alderney yesterday evening..

He says there are several undersea cables marked on the charts in that area with clear instructions not to fish or drop anchor.

All communications traffic from JT, the main operator in Jersey, is going through a single link to France with slower connections and call problems reported across the Channel Islands.

Daragh McDermott from JT said: ""With all traffic now using this connection, customers may notice some impact on services.

""It is exceptionally unlucky and unprecedented for three submarine cables to the UK to be cut in the same day.""

A number of people have reported losing internet completely earlier this morning with one woman saying she had to set up a mobile hotspot to get a connection.

Master Moore says it is still unclear where the King Arthur dropped anchor but there would be an investigation.

The BBC has approached the owners of the King Arthur, Mediterranea di Navigazione, for comment.

Guernsey's largest telecom company Sure says it has been working with JT to reroute its data through the Sure network as it was only their voice cables that were affected by the incident.

This is not the first time a ship has cut a Channel Islands telecom cable this year. In January one was cut when a ship dropped anchor in stormy weather.

Three cables went one after the other on Monday with the first going at 16:00 GMT and the last by 21:00 GMT as the anchor was dragged across the seabed.

Mr McDermott said repairing the cable would be a ""tricky, tricky job"" involving engineers going out in heavy winds to remove the cables from the sea and splice them back together.

Jersey Treasury Minister Senator Alan Maclean, who acts as government shareholder for JT, said in the States: ""If there is damage attributable to a particular owner then I'm sure they will pursue it.""","The article titled 'Ship's anchor severs Jersey's undersea internet cables' directly discusses the cutting of undersea internet cables due to a ship's anchor.

Many Asian telecom operators and users were reporting some disruptions in Internet access Monday, though the partial restoration of service was accomplished by rerouting optical communications traffic over undamaged cables and via satellites.

About half of the existing cables running across the Pacific are damaged and ""a lot of people are feeling a little bit of slowing down of Internet traffic going to the United States,"" said Bill Barney, chief executive of Hong Kong-based cable-network operator Pacnet. He declined to name the damaged cables operated by other companies, but said Pacnet's cable system connecting Japan to the U.S. isn't damaged so far. Some operators were unaffected. A spokeswoman for Australian operator Telstra Corp. (TLS.AU) said none of the company's undersea cable infrastructure was damaged.

The submarine fiber-optic cables, which can cost hundreds of millions of dollars, are typically owned by consortia of telecom companies, who share costs and capacity. While the clusters of glass fibers are enclosed in protective material, they remain vulnerable to undersea earthquakes, fishing trawlers, and ship anchors. There are also many choke points around the globe where a number of key cables converge.

While the extent of the damage to undersea cables is still unclear and financial losses unknown, operators said they are undergoing an inspection and looking to expedite restoration. Japanese telecom operator KDDI Corp. (9433.TO) said Monday one of its undersea cables between Japan and the U.S. has been damaged by the earthquake and is unable to transmit any signals, but a spokesman said the company didn't know if the cable was cut or having connection problems. The damaged part is far offshore, and it may take a while for KDDI to identify and address the problem but services are recovering after the quake, as the company can bypass the damaged part and use other cables instead, the spokesman said.

Pacific Crossing, a unit of Japan's NTT Communications Corp. that operates a cable network between Japan and the U.S., said Monday the Pacific Crossing PC-1 W and PC-1 N parts of its network remained out of service due to the earthquake. NTT Communications said some of its services for enterprises were partially unavailable in Japan's Tohoku region, but that for submarine cables between Japan, other parts of Asia and the U.S. the company is using backup cable routes.

An official from Taiwan operator Chunghwa Telecom Co. (2412.TW) said Friday the earthquake caused damage near Kita on the eastern coast of Japan to an undersea cable that belongs to the Asia Pacific Cable Network 2, which is owned by a consortium of 14 telecom operators led by AT&T Inc. (T). AT&T didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.

China Telecom Corp. (CHA), China's largest fixed-line operator by subscribers, was making emergency repairs on Friday to undersea cables damaged by the earthquake, Xinhua News Agency reported. The company said submarine fiber-optic cables connecting Japan and North America and a Pacific Crossing 1 cable near the city of Kitaibaraki, in Japan's northern Ibaraki Prefecture, were malfunctioning due to the earthquake. A China Telecom spokeswoman wasn't immediately available to comment on Monday on the status of the repairs.

Xinhua on Monday cited China Telecom as saying the company had restored 65 gigabytes of outbound capacity, after the quake had disrupted 105 gigabytes of outbound Internet capacity and another 7 gigabytes of privately leased cable capacity.

Several companies said they avoided significant service disruptions by rerouting data traffic, including South Korean telecom operator KT Corp. (KT), which said a cable that is part of the Japan-U.S. Cable Network was cut; SK Telink Corp., an affiliate of South Korean operator SK Telecom Co. (SKM); and Globe Telecom Inc. (GLO.PH) of the Philippines.

Announcing [fresh sanctions](https://www.rferl.org/a/u-s-imposes-sanctions-on-russians-for-malicious-cyberactivity/29283702.html) against Russia this week, the U.S. Treasury Department accused Moscow of ""tracking undersea communications cables"" and imposed punitive measures on a St. Petersburg firm that it says provided underwater diving equipment to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB).

The announcement followed warnings by U.S. and other Western officials about Russian activities in recent years near undersea cables that serve as conduits for nearly all global telecommunications data.

""We are now seeing Russian underwater activity in the vicinity of undersea cables that I don't believe we have ever seen,"" U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Andrew Lennon, the commander of NATO's submarine forces, [told The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russian-submarines-are-prowling-around-vital-undersea-cables-its-making-nato-nervous/2017/12/22/d4c1f3da-e5d0-11e7-927a-e72eac1e73b6_story.html?utm_term=.bb54be6cc1c6) in December.

Britain's military chief, Sir Stuart Peach, said in December that Russia could pose a major threat to NATO by attacking undersea cables critical for international trade and the Internet. He warned that economies could be hit ""immediately and potentially catastrophically"" if the cables were severed or otherwise disrupted.

But just how vulnerable is this network of cables, known as the ""backbone of the global Internet,"" to sabotage and other manipulation?

The location of cables -- which are roughly the diameter of a garden hose -- along the ocean floor offers a modicum of security from actors who would intentionally try to damage them.

""It's not that it's much more difficult to sever cables in the deep ocean, it's just that the primary forms of interference are less likely to happen,"" [writes Nicole Starosielski](https://theconversation.com/in-our-wi-fi-world-the-internet-still-depends-on-undersea-cables-49936), an associate professor at New York University and author of the 2015 book The Undersea Network.

""The sea is so big and the cables are so narrow, the probability isn't that high that you'd run across one,"" Starosielski adds.

Experts say that the multiple paths for telecommunications traffic via the cables also offer security: If a single cable were broken, in most cases that traffic would be rerouted around different parts of the network.

As of early 2018, there were an estimated 448 submarine cables -- totaling more than 1 million kilometers in length -- operating throughout the world, [according to TeleGeography](https://www2.telegeography.com/submarine-cable-faqs-frequently-asked-questions), a Washington-based market research firm.

This network, however, includes so-called ""chokepoints"" where crucial cable routes converge, according to a 2010 study by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the EastWest Institute think tank.

""A single disaster in such an area could cause catastrophic loss of regional and global connectivity,"" the [report said](https://www.reuters.com/article/security-cables/undersea-telcoms-cables-face-growing-risks-report-idUSLDE63J0NJ20100420).

Starosielski [told Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-undersea-internet-cables/) last month, however, that ""the amount of anxiety about somebody sabotaging a single cable or multiple cables is overblown.""

""If somebody knew how these systems worked and if they staged an attack in the right way, then they could disrupt the entire system. But the likelihood of that happening is very small. Most of the concerns and fears are not nearly a threat at all,"" she said.

Undersea cables are, in fact, damaged regularly, with experts estimating between 100 and 200 such incidents each year. Two of the main causes are less exotic than state sabotage; namely, anchors dragging across the seabed and fishing gear that gets tangled up with the cables, experts say.

There have been incidents of sharks biting deep-sea fiber-optic cables, though the Britain-based International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) recorded no such incident between 2007 and 2014.

In 2013, the Egyptian coast guard [arrested three divers](https://www.reuters.com/article/net-us-egypt-internet/egypt-catches-divers-cutting-internet-cable-amid-disruptions-idUSBRE92Q1AQ20130327) who authorities said were cutting through a cable near Alexandria, though officials did not indicate a motive.

Almost all undersea cables are privately owned, and the ICPC -- which has more than 170 members from more than 60 countries -- has called for action by governments around the world to safeguard the deep-ocean networks.

Undersea cables have also been targeted for surveillance purposes.

The United States tapped Soviet cables in the Sea of Okhotsk during the Cold War, and documents leaked by former U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden indicated that U.S. and British intelligence had gained access to data transmitted in undersea cables.

In September 2015, the United States monitored the Russian research vessel Yantar as it traveled to Cuba along the U.S. East Coast. The New York Times [cited U.S. Navy officials](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/world/europe/russian-presence-near-undersea-cables-concerns-us.html) as saying that it carried submersible crafts capable of diving and cutting undersea cables.

An official Russian government publication has openly discussed Yantar's surveillance capabilities.

""Yantar has devices aboard intended for deep-sea tracking, as well as equipment for connecting to top-secret communications cables,"" the official newspaper of the Russian parliament [wrote in October](https://www.pnp.ru/politics/korabl-specnaznacheniya-yantar-voshyol-v-sredizemnoe-more.html).

The U.S. Treasury Department, which identified the St. Petersburg underwater equipment company as Divetechnoservice, did not explicitly specify any connection between it and the Yantar Baltic Shipyard, which built the Yantar research vessel.

However, Russian government procurement documents, as well as arbitration records, show that Divetechnoservice signed contracts in 2012 with the shipyard to produce and test a one- and two-man deep-water submersible capable of operating at depths up to 1,000 meters (3,000 feet). And the company's website includes photographs of the submersible crafts.","The article discusses the vulnerabilities of undersea cables, including potential threats from Russian activities and the causes of cable damage.

The outage, which the cable’s owner said may have been caused by a ship’s anchor, also knocked out overseas phone calls and is hampering money transfers, airline bookings, university enrolments as well as Facebook connections to family and friends.

In the capital, Nuku’alofa, a satellite dish was hastily mounted on Monday to provide limited and slow backup connectivity, prompting hundreds of people to queue outside a government telecom office where the signal is most reliable.

“It’s like going back to the beginning of the internet,” Tonga police spokeswoman Sia Adams said on the phone. “You just wait for your turn to have your 20 minutes to access...it’s currently hot here in Tonga at the moment but they’ve put up a tent outside, with chairs, so people can wait.”

Hours have been extended to midnight to handle crowds of officials, business people and ordinary folk logging on to access cash remittances, buy plane tickets and “just chat” said Filimone Iloa, an employee at Tonga Communications Corporation.

The problem illustrates the vulnerability of undersea fiber-optic cables, which with a data-carrying capacity some 200 times that of satellites have become the backbone of global communications. Broken cables left Somalia without internet for weeks in 2017 and cut off parts of Egypt and India in 2008.

“I have a hotel and I have no idea who’s booked on Booking.com or Expedia,” said Kjell Stave, who owns the Mystic Sands hotel in the Vava’u archipelago in northern Tonga and cannot connect. Airlines were also unable to tell if flights were overbooked until passengers showed up, he added.

Tonga’s cable, which joins the country to trans-Pacific internet wires at Suva in Fiji, was severed in two spots within about 10 km (6.2 miles) of Tonga’s shoreline on Sunday night, Paula Piveni Piukala, director at cable owner Tonga Cable Ltd told Reuters.

“We haven’t really ascertained the cause, but most likely it was a boat with an anchor has dragged the cable, or something of this sort,” he said. Piukala happened to be at a telecom industry meeting in Hawaii when the breaks occurred, and so was able to quickly arrange the backup satellite link, though he said it could only provide about a tenth of the cable’s capacity.

“The main connectivity to the outside world was through the cable,” he said, adding a repair ship was preparing to leave from Samoa and could fix the problem in a week or two, weather permitting.

**ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS**  
Undersea communication cables became an academic interest of mine a few years ago. I was fascinated by the subject and shocked to learn how little is known about them. In 2008, I wrote a research proposal on a public-private partnership for cables and received a Department of Homeland Security Fellowship to attend Harvard Kennedy School to study the issue further. This work is a culmination of that proposal and process.  

I owe many thanks to the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education and the Department of Homeland Security for supporting me in this research. Some of it was developed this summer while working for the Department of Homeland Security ALERT Center of Excellence at Northeastern University. To my project mentors at ALERT, Michael Silevitch and John Beaty, I owe a debt of gratitude for developing my initial ideas and barring with me through my first presentations.  

I especially want to thank Eric Rosenbach, my faculty advisor, who appreciated the significance of this project enough to find funding for me to attend professional conferences on the subject. His overall guidance was truly beneficial, particularly since he has been my interface with my client throughout the year.  

Overall, this paper incorporates research collected from presentations delivered at two professional conferences, the Reliability of Global Undersea Communication Cables Infrastructure (ROGUCCI) Summit and the Pacific Telecommunications Council (PTC) 2010, several dozen interviews and informal conversations with industry experts, a vast literature review, as well as source documents provided to me from the Department of Homeland Security.

Commissioned in 2000, the South-East Asia - Middle East - Western Europe 3 two fibre pair cable is some 39,000 kilometres long in total, spanning stretches of the globe from northern Germany to Australia and Japan. Its current capacity is 480 Gbps (10Gbps x 48 wavelengths).

A Sea-Me-We 3 fault notice - sighted by _iTnews_ - says the fault occurred from January 10 between repeaters 345 and 346, some 1,126 kilometres from the Tuas cable station in Singapore.

The operators of the cable said the implications for customers ""should be minimal"".

However, the notice warns that ""customers could still experience increased latency, as services are routed via alternative routes which will be heavily utilised by other carriers also affected by this fault.""

A repair ship, the ASEAN Explorer is set to arrive on the fault site on February 7, with an estimated resolution date of February 11.

The cable has been impacted by major disruptions in the past, caused by ship's anchors, earthquakes and other phenomena. A 2005 break cut all of Pakistan's electronic communications, affecting roughly 10 million internet users.

The chief executive and founder of ISP Vocus, James Spenceley, confirmed to _ITnews_ that the cable had been severed.

""SMW3 is a single strand cable system and unfortunately this type of event happens every few years to those,"" Spenceley explains.

Such bizarre underwater international telecoms infrastructure robbery occurred on March 25 and since then Vietnam’s Internet users have been struggling with far slower speed.

The broken cable system, named TVH, was built in 1993-1995, connecting Thailand, Vietnam and Hong Kong with a capacity of 560 megabits per second.

The Vietnam Telecom International (VTI) got puzzled when the cable went down. It occurred soon after the Asia Pacific region recovered from prolonged bandwidth crisis as earthquake snapped a bunch of submarine cables in the Taiwanese coast.

VTI called a submarine cable fixing ship from Singapore. But its crew went bonkers after detecting 11-kilometers of the cable was missing from the floor of Ca Mau Sea. The maintenance vessel went back as it never carries that many cables in the first place.

Baffled VTI already lost four million dollars in revenue and it will incur further 2.6 million dollars to fix the underwater missing link. Vietnam’s Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Public Security, the Naval Command and military commands joined hands to catch the fishy fishermen.

Authorities have not discovered who initially cut the cable. But last Wednesday, police in the southern coastal town of Vung Tau said they captured a boat carrying 60 tons of undersea optical fibre cable, reported cellular-news.com quoting German news agency dpa.

Earlier the police also captured three boats and recovered 40 tons of similar cables. Same man, a Vung Tau resident, allegedly owns all the four boats.

But VTI’s deputy director Lan Quoc Cuong said the cable seized by police in Vung Tau does not match the cable his company owns, and they must have come from a different severed line.

He said finding the cable would have been difficult for the thieves. “The cable is located in different locations and at different depths,” he said. “Maybe, while using an anchor, they found the cable by accident and started cutting it.”

Meanwhile the Vietnamese media has made a disturbing revelation. The country’s defence ministry contracted few companies last August to salvage the decommissioned undersea copper cables. The US-backed former South Vietnamese government deployed them before the country became independent in 1975.

Reports said some of these companies apparently went for legitimate undersea treasures hunt but they may have struck the operational undersea fibre optic cables instead.

Whatever the case may be, robbing submarine cable is getting rampant in Vietnam, said VietNamNet Bridge. So far this year, five undersea optical cable theft cases have been detected.

The latest case was on May 3 when border guards of the southern province of Kien Giang detected two fishing boats carrying 80 tonnes of cable. A boat owner said that while catching fish offshore, his boat caught the cable and they cut the cable and brought it to the mainland to sell.

Earlier on April 15, three fishing boats loaded with 80 tonnes of cable were caught in the southern province of Soc Trang. Fishermen on those boats said that they found the cable offshore and stopped catching fish to cut the cable to sell as waste.

Authorities of Kien Giang, Bac Lieu, Soc Trang provinces have seized hundreds of tonnes of telecom cable from fishing boats. Police say they have broken up five rings selling some 500 tons of illegally salvaged cable since the beginning of this year, cellular-news.com said.","The article titled ""Vietnam's submarine cable 'lost' and 'found'"" discusses the theft of submarine cables in Vietnam, specifically mentioning that maritime thieves stole 11 kilometers of a cable, leading to significant disruptions in internet connectivity for users in the country.

It highlights the financial impact on Vietnam Telecom International (VTI), which has already lost four million dollars in revenue and will incur further costs to repair the damaged infrastructure.

The article also details the involvement of various authorities in recovering the stolen cables and mentions multiple incidents of cable theft occurring in the region.

This comprehensive discussion about the theft and its implications clearly establishes the article's focus on the topic of cut sea cables."

[Damage to submarine cables in the Red Sea](https://subtelforum.com/seacom-confirms-cable-outage-in-red-sea/) is disrupting telecommunications networks and forcing providers to reroute internet traffic between Asia, Europe and the Middle East.

### Internet disruption  

Out of the more than 15 submarine cables in the Red Sea, four have been severed last week, affecting 25% of the [traffic flow between Asia, Europe, and the Middle East](https://www.forbesmiddleeast.com/innovation/technology/greece-and-saudi-arabia-reportedly-planning-fiber-optic-data-cable-between-europe-and-asia), HGC Global Communications said Monday.  

The affected cables are Seacom, TGN, AAE-1, and EIG.  

HGC did not mention how exactly these cables had been damaged. However, it noted ‘significant' disruption to communications networks in the Middle East, the Hong Kong-based telecoms company said last week, announcing the damage.  

HGC estimates about 15% of Asia traffic goes westbound, while 80% of the traffic passes through submarine cables in the Red Sea.  

Seacom experienced a subsea cable system outage last week, which lasted more than 48 hours. The disruption impacted connectivity between Africa and Europe, local media reported.

### Maintenance  

Yemen's Ministry of Telecommunications and Information Technology, in a statement on February 28, emphasized its commitment to safeguarding all telecom submarine cables and services, pledging readiness to facilitate maintenance and repairs in collaboration with the Government of Yemen and licensed parties under Sana'a's Maritime Affairs Authority.  

“(We) are ready to assist requests for permits and identify ships with the Yemeni Navy, and we confirm this is out of concern for their safety,” said Telecommunications Minister Misfer Al-Numair on X Monday.

### Rerouting traffic

Subsea cable operator [Seacom](https://subtelforum.com/seacom-seeks-more-capacity-from-new-cables/) encountered a service-affecting outage on its cable system on 24 February.

In a statement, the company says the disruption is only on the segment of the cable that runs from Mombasa (Kenya) to Zafarana (Egypt).

Initial assessments suggest the disruption to the subsea cable occurred within the vicinity of the Red Sea, and other cables in the area appear to have also been impacted, it adds.

Seacom says it is unable to confirm the cause of the disruption at this time, but is working with its cable repair partner to assess the feasibility of the repair in the region.

The firm points out that the location of the cable break is significant due to its geopolitical sensitivity and ongoing tensions, making it a challenging environment for maintenance and repair operations.

“Seacom still continues to carry traffic on its own cable between Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and South Africa for both transmission and IP services,” says the company.

“All other IP-based services destined for Europe and other regions were automatically rerouted via Seacom’s alternative routes on Equiano, PEACE and WACS cable systems, and supported by its diverse terrestrial infrastructure, ensuring its clients remain operational with some latency in their internet communications.”

It notes that although the outage has had an impact on some clients’ businesses across East and Southern Africa, Seacom has been working diligently to ensure the continuity of its services.

“Seacom provided customers with a cautionary alert on 5 February that any disruptions to the cable system could be impacted by delays in repair operations due to the instability of the area. The team is currently working towards restoration timelines and will communicate these plans with our clients,” it concludes.","The article titled 'Seacom Confirms Cable Outage in Red Sea' discusses a specific incident involving a subsea cable outage that occurred on February 24, 2024.

February 5, 2008, 9:55 AM

Feb. 5, 2008 — When the Internet suddenly collapsed early last Wednesday across the Middle East and into India, it provided a stark reminder of how the Net's virtual spaces can still be held hostage to real-world events.

Almost simultaneously, two separate undersea fiber-optic cables connecting Europe with Egypt, and eventually with the Middle East and India, were cut. The precise cause remains unknown: experts initially said that ships' anchors, dragged by stormy weather across the sea floor, were the most likely culprit, but Egyptian authorities have said that no ships were in the region.

Whatever the cause, the effects were immediate. According to its telecommunications ministry, Egypt initially lost 70 percent of its connection to the outside Internet and 30 percent of service to its call-center industry, which depended less on the lines. Between 50 and 60 percent of India's Net outbound connectivity was similarly lost on the westbound route critical to the nation's burgeoning outsourcing industry.

""This [fiber path across the Mediterranean] is a choke point, which until recently was a very lightly trafficked route where there wasn't great need for cable,"" says Tim Strong, an analyst at telecommunications research firm Telegeography Research. ""There are many new cables planned for the region, but as it happens, they're not in service yet.""

Undersea cable damage is hardly rare--indeed, more than 50 repair operations were mounted in the Atlantic alone last year, according to marine cable repair company Global Marine Systems. But last week's breaks came at one of the world's bottlenecks, where Net traffic for whole regions is funneled along a single route.

This kind of damage is rarely such a deep concern in the United States and Europe. The Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are crisscrossed so completely with fast fiber networks that a break in one area typically has no significant effect. Net traffic simply uses one of many possible alternate destinations to reach its goal.

Not so with the route connecting Europe to Egypt, and from there to the Middle East. Today, just three major data cables stretch from Italy to Egypt and run down the Suez Canal, and from there to much of the Middle East. (A separate line connects Italy with Israel.) A serious cut here is immediately obvious across the region, and a double cut can be crippling.","The article titled ""Analyzing the Internet Collapse"" discusses multiple outages in India and the Middle East due to the cutting of undersea fiber-optic cables.

It specifically mentions that two separate undersea cables connecting Europe with Egypt were cut, leading to significant internet connectivity loss in Egypt and India.

The article details the immediate impact of these cuts, stating that Egypt lost 70% of its internet connection and India lost 50-60% of its outbound connectivity.

The discussion clearly treats the topic of cut sea cables as a central theme, providing both direct references to 'undersea cables' and contextual implications of their damage on internet connectivity.

Therefore, the article satisfies the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables."

The ship was waiting to enter Mombasa - one of Africa's busiest ports - when it anchored in a restricted area.

It could take up to 14 days to repair, cable owners The East African Marine Systems (Teams) told the BBC.

This is one of three undersea cables to have arrived in the region since 2009, delivering faster internet access.

The cable run by Teams, which is partly owned by the Kenyan government, was damaged at the weekend.

Internet service providers and mobile phone operators have re-routed to the Seacom link - which was not damaged by the dropped anchor.

But the company has only bought a small amount of bandwidth because of cost.

The BBC's Noel Mwakugu in Nairobi says as a result internet connections are expected to slow down by 20% in Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, Ethiopia and South Sudan's capital, Juba.

Seacom - the first to be up and running - links East Africa to Europe, India and South Africa.

Teams links the region to the United Arab Emirates - and Eassy, which went live in July 2010, links countries along the East African coast.

Correspondents say that since then, the increased bandwidth has given a boost to mobile services and the burgeoning tech scene of home-grown developers, programmers and designers in Kenya.

In the first 12 months after the cables arrived, the number of internet subscriptions in the country jumped from 1.8m to 3.1m.

Cable repairers are working to repair damage.

Advisories by the TPG-owned iiNet and Internode report that the main issue for Australians is a cable break around 54 kilometres off the coast of Hong Kong.

“We have temporarily routed via the US and redirected peering whilst the issue is outstanding,” both ISPs reported.

“Our network partner is currently engaged with submarine teams for initiation of repair process.”

One of the affected cables is SEA-ME-WE3, which currently routes traffic from Perth to Singapore and beyond.

The cable has 39 landing points, including Deep Water Bay in Hong Kong.

Although repair teams have been engaged, SEA-ME-WE3 is expected to face problems for some time.

Wholesale operators have confirmed the break and said they have “received a tentative repair completion of 13th October 2017”.

“However these dates tend to change over time due to the nature of [subsea repairs],” the operators advised customers.

ISPs say that while they are forced to route Asian traffic via the US, internet users should expect speed, latency and packet loss problems “to international destinations in Asia”.

“This may result in webpages taking longer to load, as well as impact to time-sensitive activities such as online gaming,” they said.

SEA-ME-WE3 has suffered regular cable breaks over the years, including in 2015 and 2013.

Three cable consortiums have been vying in recent years to build a new cable on the Perth-Singapore route, thereby reducing dependence on the ageing SEA-ME-WE3 infrastructure.

Vocus’ Australia-Singapore Cable (ASC) is likely to be the first to lay cable, though other projects by Indigo Consortium and Trident remain on the horizon.

But just because destroying the cables would be logistically and technically difficult for a terrorist or individual—not to mention suicidal; the voltage running through them would be enough to kill someone trying to cut through—doesn’t make it unthinkable. In March, Egyptian authorities accused three men in a fishing boat of trying to sever a submarine cable connecting Alexandria to the Web. The evidence was thin and experts are as cynical about that incident as the latest service disruption in Syria. But both episodes draw attention to how exposed the world’s Internet infrastructure really is.

Let’s begin with how the cables are physically stabilized. They’re not. The cables tend to rest unsecured on the ocean floor. Landslides, ship anchors—all are capable of moving or dragging the cables out of their normal position. Pull too hard, and they break. In 2006, an underwater landslide between Taiwan and the Philippines disrupted 19 out of 20 Internet cables in the area, causing service in much of Asia to go dark. Even though software could tell the repair crews exactly which part of the cables had malfunctioned, locating the actual point of the break took more time because the event had moved the cables and buried them.

There are other vulnerabilities, too. When the cables make landfall, they generally terminate at a control station that brings together more than one submarine cable. Disable the control station, and you might be able to cause some level of disruption downstream. These facilities are only lightly guarded, according to David Belson, who authors an annual “State of the Internet” report for Akamai, the Web-traffic routing company.

“They don’t have sharks with lasers on their heads, or armed guards, or anything like that,” Belson told me. “In many cases, the cables will just come ashore in some nondescript shack.”

The United States is home to at least a couple dozen such stations. Responsibility for defending them—and the underwater cables themselves—falls to the host country, or the consortium of companies that initially laid the fiber down. But there isn’t much patrolling that takes place, said Jason Healey, director of the Atlantic Council’s Cyber Statecraft Initiative. That’s because the assumption is most well-meaning people will try and avoid the cables.

Maritime cables are “extremely” well marked on maps, said Healey. That helps trawlers and tankers steer clear, but it could also aid a malicious actor under other circumstances.

Healey has worked with the White House on a number of cyber war-game exercises. In one scenario, fictitious Iranians disrupted the Internet by convincing a handful of ship captains to drag their anchors across the ocean floor off of Djibouti, France, Great Britain and Egypt.

Only in British waters would an attempt like that be reliably caught, said Healey.

“The British patrol heavily outside Bude,” he told me, referring to the cable landing station located in Cornwall. “If you’re in the area, they are going to be paying a lot of interest to you, and if you cut the cables they would be all over you very quickly, probably within minutes.”

Areas that are less well-developed—Djibouti, say—would almost certainly lack the capacity to defend the cables the same way. Luckily, nobody’s launched a “Die Hard”-style plot to unplug everything—yet. For now, all we have to worry about are environmental hazards. And “terrorists.”

Damage to several undersea telecom cables that caused outages across the Middle East and Asia could have been an act of sabotage, the International Telecommunication Union said on Monday.  

""We do not want to preempt the results of ongoing investigations, but we do not rule out that a deliberate act of sabotage caused the damage to the undersea cables over two weeks ago,"" the UN agency's head of development, Sami al-Murshed, told AFP.  

Five undersea cables were damaged in late January and early February leading to disruption to Internet and telephone services in parts of the Middle East and south Asia.  

There has been speculation that the sheer number of cables being cut over such a short period was too much of a coincidence and that sabotage must have been involved.  

India's Flag telecom revealed on February 7 that the cut to the Falcon cable between the United Arab Emirates and Oman was caused by a ship's anchor. But mystery shrouds what caused another four reported cuts.  

""Some experts doubt the prevailing view that the cables were cut by accident, especially as the cables lie at great depths under the sea and are not passed over by ships,"" Murshed said on the sidelines of a conference on cyber-crime held in Gulf state of Qatar.  

The Falcon cable has since been repaired, along with the Flag Europe Asia (FEA) cable which was damaged off Egypt's Mediterranean coast. The status of the remaining cable is still unclear.","The article discusses damage to several undersea telecom cables, which led to outages in the Middle East and Asia.

The earthquake and its aftershocks and the tsunami resulted in multiple submarine cable cuts that threatened much of the intra-Asia and trans-Pacific telecommunications.

Japanese domestic communications were almost disrupted. People lined up at public phones which took priority during and after the earthquake. Cell phones still worked, but the service got jammed quickly. Data worked much better than voice on mobile networks. The three largest mobile phone networks reported service disruptions across Japan: NTT DoCoMo, KDDI Corp., and Softbank Corp. Wireless reception was considered poor or bad after the earthquake.

The quake and tsunami caused multiple submarine cable cuts, seriously impacting intra-Asia and trans-Pacific communications and Internet access. About 20 submarine cables land in Japan. APCN-2 and Japan-US CN were first reported cut after the earthquake as the tsunami approached the seashore houses in Kita Ibaraki where both cables land. The Kita Ibaraki cable landing station was almost isolated from the submarine networks. As the tsunami spread, the Ajigaura cable landing station was hit and isolated, with PC-1 and EAC submarine cables also cut. Further cable cuts were reported on China-US CN and C2C, impacting not only Japanese carriers but also other Asian carriers. China Telecom reported an outage of 105G trans-pacific capacity for its Internet traffic, amounting to approximately 22% of its overall trans-pacific capacity.

**INTRODUCTION**
The backbone of the nation’s—and indeed, of the world’s—information infrastructure is now preponderantly composed of fiber optic cables. A critical element of that backbone is the world’s ever-expanding network of submarine fiber optic cables. The importance of those cables could conceivably make them a potential target or targets for other states or terrorists. This appendix briefly documents the importance of the fiber optic cable network to the United States, potential vulnerabilities in the network, and the possible ramifications for the United States of a widespread network failure brought about by an act of sabotage.

Over the past decade, the increased demand for bandwidth driven by the Internet, as well as the continuing international trend of privatization of national telecommunications industries, has outstripped by far the resources offered by satellite transmission of voice and data. Instead, the fraction of transoceanic voice and data transmitted over undersea cables has grown in the past 12 years from 2 percent to as high as 80 percent in 2000. As demand has grown, so have the numbers of cables on the seabed.

These fiber optic networks offer a number of security advantages over satellite communications. Fiber optic cables are thought to be much harder to “eavesdrop” on than satellites and have more dependable installation and repair practices. However, those fiber optic cables are in many ways significantly more vulnerable than is commonly thought. Submarine cables already face many man-made and natural dangers. Anchors dropped from ships and dredging fishing nets are two of the most common.

Security is an important issue, because these cables are an increasingly vital element of the global economy. An intentional systemwide disruption of fiber optic cables could cause significant commercial damage.

In particular, the ability of overseas firms to get reliable, real-time data regarding U.S. markets—and vice versa—could be substantially curtailed, potentially sparking a panic. In addition, an increasing amount of U.S. military communications occurs over these commercial networks. Disruption could significantly impede these communications.

In recent years, wiring companies have focused on redundancy as an important aspect of the cable network. However, the desire for security against inadvertent nautical events may have been counterproductive. The results of this “stacking” can be seen in the number of cable systems with a total capacity of about 206 gigabytes per second, where six terminate in only one of the same three cities in New Jersey.

Moreover, this point yields an interesting counterexample: that of Taiwan. Unlike the United States, Taiwan would be unable to depend on a vast overland information infrastructure beyond its borders in the event of damage to its fiber optic lifelines. A recent example of the chaos potentially caused by communications outages is that of Australia. One cut cable in the SEA-WE-ME-3 network leading from Australia to Singapore caused Australia’s largest Internet provider—Telstra—to lose up to 70 percent of its Internet capacity.

According to an online news portal in Vietnam, VnExpress, the Asia Pacific Gateway (APG) is undergoing repairs and will affect Internet speeds in the region.

[VnExpress reported](https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/internet-to-slow-down-in-vietnam-on-repair-of-undersea-cable-3894842.html), ""Repair work on the Asia Pacific Gateway (APG) off Malaysia, which encountered an outage late last month, is scheduled for completion on April 11, Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group said.""

APG is a partnership between China Mobile (China), China Telecom (China), China Unicom (China), Chunghwa Telecom (Taiwan), Facebook, KT Corp (South Korea), LG Uplus (South Korea), NTT Communications (Japan), StarHub (Singapore), TIME dotCom (Global Transit, Malaysia) Viettel (Vietnam) and VNPT (Vietnam).

TIME’s wholly owned subsidiary Global Transit is currently administering the APG on behalf of the Group.

With a total length of 10,400 km, the [APG network](https://subtelforum.com/86nec-completes-asia-pacific-gateway-submarine-cable/) can deliver a capacity of more than 54 Tbps, design protected for 100 Gbps technology upgrades. The [submarine cable system went live in late 2016](https://www.malaysianwireless.com/2016/11/apg-submarine-cable-malaysia-operational/).

“Several internet service providers have said they are ready to reroute and transfer signals to other cables to minimize the impacts on users. But it will take users longer to access websites or online services hosted outside the country during peak hours.” said VnExpress.

VnExpress said that the APG submarine cable system [have broken down](https://subtelforum.com/cable-fault-impacts-vietnam-internet/) twice since going live.

On 27 February, 2019, HiNet (Chunghwa Telecom) in Taiwan [posted the following](https://www.hinet.net/notifyPage.html?type=0&id=1692fae64e0000007dfd):

“Due to APG cable outage (occurred at 21:32, February 27, 2019 (GMT+8)), HiNet customers might suffer from higher latency when connecting to Singapore during peak time only, while the other non-peak time will have no further impact after our emergency action. Will keep the latest announcement here once any update for the APG outage. We apologize for any inconvenience resulted from the event.”

At the moment, more than 50 million people in Vietnam are experiencing slow Internet connection to the rest world as the Intra Asia (IA) cable system, one two major internet routes in Vietnam, is also undergoing repair works.

**How _are_ damaged submarine cables repaired?**

Using MainOne as an example, in this scenario, a fault occurred about 3,000 kilometers south of Portugal, where the cable lies in 3,400 meters of water. (The cause? An underwater landslide.)

Here’s how a technical team managed the fault.

According to the technical report issued by MainOne following the cable restoration, the first step was to call on the organization’s membership in the Atlantic Cable Maintenance and Repair Agreement (ACMA).

ACMA is a non-profit subsea maintenance agreement with 59 members. These members include companies responsible for the operations and maintenance of undersea communications and power cables in the Atlantic, North Sea, and Southeastern Pacific Ocean. With the help of this organization, a French cable ship was sent to repair the damaged cable.

By the next morning, the French vessel was headed to Portland, United Kingdom to pick up supplies. This included backup cables, a spare repeater, and jointing materials.

Next stop? The repair location. Eight days after leaving France, the vessel arrived on June 27.

Once on the scene, the cable was grappled and brought on board. The team surveyed the damaged section and game-planned how to repair. The engineers ultimately replaced the damaged section with the new cable section brought from Portland, which was spliced into the broken ends.

Following plenty of tests, molds were applied to protect the fibers before being placed back into the water. The repair passed the even more testing and the cable was back in business during the early hours of July 3.","The article discusses the repair of the MainOne submarine cable, which was damaged due to an underwater landslide.

It provides direct mentions of 'submarine cables' and details the repair process, making it a central theme of the article.

The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) confirmed that the Asia-Africa-Europe (AAE-1) submarine cable was damaged near Qatar, impacting internet services managed by the Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd (PTCL).

PTA issued a public notice, advising that repair efforts were underway and updates would follow.

Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) Chairman Major General (retd) Hafeez Ur Rehman recently dismissed the notion that sharks were responsible for damaging submarine cables.

Speaking at a Senate Standing Committee on Information and Technology, Rehman clarified that wildlife, including sharks, cannot damage submarine cables, and the issue likely stemmed from technical factors.

PTA Chairman informed the committee that Pakistan currently relies on seven submarine cables for internet services, with an additional “2 Africa” cable expected to improve connectivity soon.

PTCL, which manages three submarine cables — AAE-1, SMW-4, and IMEWE — relies on auxiliary connections to maintain connectivity in the country, with all three cables landing in Karachi. SMW-4 and IMEWE have landing points at Hawksbay Beach, while AAE-1 connects via Clifton Beach.

Additionally, Transworld Associates operates two submarine cables — SMW-5 and TWA-1 — linking Pakistan with international internet hubs in the Gulf. Meanwhile, Cyber Internet Services Ltd manages the PEACE cable, which originates in China, terminates at Misri Shah in Karachi, and connects onward to Europe.

He also addressed the PTA’s role in regulating social media, revealing that the authority receives around 500 complaints daily. He noted that approximately 80% of flagged content is removed from platforms, while the remaining 20% stays accessible.

A key point of discussion was the PTA’s authority to impose regional internet shutdowns. Senator Kamran Murtaza questioned the legal basis for such actions, as there is no explicit provision in the law permitting regional restrictions.

An official from the Ministry of IT clarified that the Ministry of Interior directs such shutdowns when deemed necessary, a practice in place since 2016.

The PTA Chairman acknowledged that internet restrictions have also been enforced following directives from the Supreme Court and High Court. He emphasized that targeted internet shutdowns to address specific content issues could be carried out legally under government orders.","The article titled 'Submarine cable damage slows internet speed across Pakistan' discusses the damage to the AAE-1 submarine cable and its significant impact on internet connectivity in Pakistan.

"Cybersecurity Risks of Chinese Undersea Cable Investments","Examines vulnerabilities in global internet infrastructure linked to Chinese investments in undersea cables, with implications for cybersecurity and international relations.","https://jsis.washington.edu/eacenter/2017/02/06/cybersecurity-implications-chinese-undersea-cable-investment","2023-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","About the Authors Stacia Lee",Yes,"Stacia Lee","Seattle, Washington",-,"2023-02-06","English","University of Washington, Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies","In 2013, BRICS business leaders announced plans to construct a $185 million submarine cable connecting Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. However, more than three years later, the BRICS cable has not come to fruition, presumably due to intra-bloc political differences and challenging domestic economic positions.

China is filling the vacuum left by the BRICS cable. Its companies are the most active investors and builders of submarine cables in the developing world. Between 2012 and 2015, Chinese companies were involved with only 7% of disclosed global submarine cable projects, and exclusively with projects that connected either to the Chinese Mainland, Taiwan, or Hong Kong. In contrast, between 2016 and 2019, Chinese companies will participate in 20% of all cable construction projects, over half of which take place outside the South China Sea.

Chinese companies lag behind only the French company Alcatel-Lucent and the Swiss-owned TE Connectivity in total future submarine cable project activity. While Alcatel and TE Connectivity have had decades to expand and engage with the global market, the market share gained by Chinese companies in a relatively short period of time may signal Chinese market dominance in the near future. The meteoric rise of Chinese companies in submarine cable ownership and construction makes it abundantly clear that the Chinese are here to make an impact on the world of Internet infrastructure.

Chinese state-owned telecommunications companies are actively expanding their network of cable consortium partnerships. China Unicom, China Telecom, and China Mobile are three state-owned telecommunications providers listed as owners of the new SeaMeWe-5 cable connecting Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Whereas Chinese companies have traditionally participated only in projects that directly involving Chinese territory, Chinese companies are also investing beyond Asia; for example, China Unicom shares ownership of a cable connecting Cameroon and Brazil.

While state-owned companies join cable ownership consortiums, Huawei Marine Systems is installing multiple submarine cables throughout the world. A 2008 joint venture between the Chinese technology giant Huawei and the British company Global Marine Systems, Huawei Marine Systems is making headlines for its work in Africa. At AfricaCom 2016, Huawei announced plans to build eight new cable systems (two of which are included in the count above, six more of which remain to be announced) connecting the continent and upgrade two existing cables. In the last year, Huawei has also been commissioned to build cables connecting Malaysia, Cambodia, and Thailand, build a national broadband transmission network for Papua New Guinea, construct a new cable for Belize, and partner with LTI on a cable project in Indonesia. Recently completed cables include a joint venture with Ooredoo in the Maldives, and Huawei’s tenth project in Africa.

China’s rise as a formidable player in ICT development may stem from domestic business policy. Around 2015, the Chinese government gave its telecommunications companies permission to fully expand globally. Before, Chinese companies were more restricted in their global reach, although Huawei managed to participate in a few cable projects, including one connecting Suriname and Guiana, which raised eyebrows as early as 2010. China’s ICT expansion is in line with China’s desire to expand its global reach.

For example, Huawei’s involvement in Africa largely mirrors other investments in non-digital regional infrastructure, which increases China’s influence, helps foster new markets for Chinese goods, and provides Beijing with valuable access to natural resources and agriculture. In other words, sending Chinese telecoms abroad through ownership and construction contracts may ultimately fall in line with Beijing’s long-term political and economic goals.

Demand for Chinese investment and construction is also fueled by a global political climate wary of Western, particularly American, Internet infrastructure. While the BRICS cable may be indefinitely stalled, demand for a BRICS-like cable persists. The elevated role of Chinese telecommunications companies in owning and constructing submarine cables responds to this demand by providing an alternative to previously dominant American-led consortiums. Additionally, many Western cable companies have stopped investing in new cables due to their limited financial returns and the omnipotence of Western connectivity. China remains one of the few partners available to countries seeking to grow their connectivity through undersea cables.

It is clear that Chinese telecommunications companies are increasing their global orientation and that international contracts may be politically expedient for the Chinese government and amenable to the needs of developing nations. However, many aspects of growing Chinese international activity are opaque. It is unclear how heavily Beijing weighs in on specific decisions, especially in the investment decisions of state-owned companies. The same lack of transparency regarding state and company relationship extends to Huawei Marine Systems, which essentially purchases its market share by offering extraordinarily cost-efficient installation prices. Since constructing submarine cables is often prohibitively expensive, it is a mystery how Huawei remains solvent. Huawei has repeatedly denied receiving subsidies from the government, although Western companies insist that Huawei does in fact receive illegal government assistance, and have been successful at blacklisting Huawei from certain projects in the West.

Concerns over Chinese telecommunications companies’ independence yield important political considerations. While Chinese investment may prove affordable and attractive, history dictates that reliance upon Chinese infrastructure can have deleterious and politically-motivated cybersecurity consequences – one need only consider the case of Vietnam, where Chinese investors have dominated both physical and digital infrastructure development. When Vietnam expressed its disapproval of China’s position on the South China Sea, Chinese investors froze cash flows to projects, leaving Vietnam in limbo. Chinese hackers have also exploited their knowledge of Vietnam’s airport systems – which were provided by the Chinese – to hack and suspend airport computers as well as airline websites. The confluence of extreme Chinese infrastructure dependence and politics in South Asia may not extend to other nations with which China is doing business, but sets a precedent that may leave the international community wary of Chinese partnerships.

Further yet, the Chinese government’s propensity for digital surveillance leaves one questioning the supposedly apolitical nature of increased global cable development. Even if the Chinese aren’t building backdoors into their cables now, they certainly have the potential to do so in the future, and the blurry line between private companies and state interest render cables increasingly accessible to Beijing.","The article discusses 'submarine cables' and 'undersea cables' extensively, focusing on Chinese investments and their implications for cybersecurity and international relations.

While it does not directly mention 'cut sea cables', it addresses the vulnerabilities and geopolitical tensions surrounding these cables, indicating a connection to the topic.

This map shows how the huge, complicated network of undersea cables which keep the internet running is spread around the world.

The map, by telecom analytics company Telegeography, uses coloured lines to show how there are many hundreds of fibre optic cables running under the world's oceans.

It shows the sheer scale of the infrastructure which keeps the internet running. It's built up over decades, mainly as a result of private enterprise rather than coordinated state infrastructure projects, like road or water networks.

Lines shown on the map above are not exactly geographically correct, but they show the broad path of the cables and which territories they connect.

If Russia were to cut the cables many countries could go offline Telegeography.

According to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, 97 per cent of all intercontinental data is carried via such cables.

Although they are of obvious strategic importance to the countries involved, relatively little is done to guard them. In recent months, defence authorities have started to warn that state aggressors — Russia in particular — could cut them.

A US admiral, one of Britain's most senior military commanders, the former head of GCHQ and a London-based think-tank all made similar warnings in a matter of days late last year.

Rishi Sunak, a Conservative MP, produced a report for the Policy Exchange think-tank in which he warned that Russia is ""aggressively operating"" in the Atlantic, where cables link Europe and the US.

In the foreword to the report, retired US Navy Admiral James Stavridis claimed: ""Russian submarine forces have undertaken detailed monitoring and targeting activities in the vicinity of North Atlantic deep-sea cable infrastructure.""

He said they have the capacity to make a concentrated hit, causing ""potentially catastrophic"" damage.

Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, the UK's most senior military officer, gave a speech in December in which he said: ""There is a new risk to our way of life, which is the vulnerability of the cables that criss-cross the seabeds.

""Can you imagine a scenario where those cables are cut or disrupted, which would immediately and potentially catastrophically affect both our economy and other ways of living.""

At the start of December, former GCHQ director Robert Hannigan told The Times newspaper: ""In hybrid warfare you could tweak the UK economy, even without bringing it to its knees, by just cutting a few fibre-optic cables.""

""It could slow things down and with automated trading you could make life pretty difficult if you wanted to without going for full conflict.""

Russia has responded to the threat by suggesting it is not serious. Its embassy in London ran a Twitter poll in response to the Times interview, where most respondents seemed not to take the prospect seriously.","The article discusses the strategic importance of undersea cables and explicitly mentions the risk of Russia cutting them.

It highlights concerns from military officials regarding potential disruptions and their catastrophic effects on economies and connectivity.

Internet is down in portions of the North Slope after the fiber optic cable owned by Quintillion had some type of break.

Arctic Slope Telephone Association Cooperative has said the communities impacted are Atqasuk, Point Hope, Utqiagvik, and Wainwright.

“Currently these communities are experiencing an all services Quintillion network outage. Quintillion’s teams have been deployed to investigate a possible fiber cut. A restoral to all services is underway. We will share updates as they become available. Credits will be applied following the restoral, for all customers affected in all communities,” ASTAC said on its Facebook page.

GCI said, “Our connectivity partner, Quintillion Networks, is experiencing a network outage that is impacting some of our services in Nome, Kotzebue, Utqiagvik and Wainwright. Slower internet service will be experienced. Voice and text are not impacted at this time. Quintillion teams are working to restore service as quickly as possible. We appreciate your patience.”

Maniilaq Association said the 911 line is down in Kotzebue for ATT phones due to the break. The land line is still working.

Each community provider has its own communities and own networks. Each community is impacted to a different degree. For instance, ASTAC has some satellite backup in place for its communities but there is no statewide backup network to make these situations avoidable.

[Less than a year ago](https://subtelforum.com/quintillion-updates-on-arctic-cable-repairs/), there was a break in the Quintillion fiber optic cable on the ocean floor, leaving communities without internet for several weeks. This break is not thought to be a subsea problem.

India's Internet service was disrupted by up to 60 percent on Wednesday because of a breakdown in an international undersea cable network, the Internet Service Providers' Association of India said.

It was not immediately possible to gauge the impact of the disruption on financial institutions. Egypt’s telecoms ministry said 70 percent of the country’s Internet network was down and India initially said it had lost over half its bandwidth.

“This cut has affected Internet services in Egypt with a partial disruption of 70 percent of the network nationwide,” the Egyptian ministry said in a statement.

Residents of Gulf Arab countries also reported a slowdown in Internet connectivity. The Bahrain Telecommunications Co said its services were affected after two undersea cables were cut near Alexandria, on Egypt’s north coast.

The Egyptian telecoms ministry said it did not know how the cables were cut or if weather was a factor. Storms had forced Egypt to close the northern mouth of the Suez canal on Tuesday.

India also reported serious disruptions to its services and Rajesh Chharia, president of the Internet Service Providers’ Association of India, told Reuters: “There has been a 50 to 60 percent cut in bandwidth.”

Chharia told the Headlines Today news channel that a “degraded” service would be up and running by Wednesday night, but full restoration would take 10 to 15 days.

“The big operators have transferred their small broadband connectivity through the Pacific route, and that’s the reason there’s no hue and cry in the country,” he said.

One Indian Internet service provider affected by the cut, Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL), said its service had been “largely restored” by diverting to another cable. Two outsourcing firms in Bangalore reported minimal disruption.

MIDDLE EAST ROUTES AFFECTED

AT&T Inc. said that a cable owned by a consortium of which it is part was affected. “We do know that one cable is disrupted,” AT&T spokesman Michael Coe said, adding that the cable in question goes between France and Egypt.

Egypt said its call centres saw their services cut by more than 30 percent, and two Egyptian stockbrokers said market transactions were considerably slower and some international trading orders could not go through.

Egypt’s Deputy Central Bank Governor Tarek Amer, asked about the impact of the disruption on the banking system, said: “We are disappointed (with) the service and will consider alternatives for the banking system if this happens again.”

In Cairo, much of the capital city was without access to the Internet for the bulk of the day, frustrating businesses and the professions.

“I can’t do anything because I manage all my work by e-mail. It is very frustrating,” said Egyptian lawyer Rebecca Mikhail. “As soon as I came in (to work) at 10 a.m. I didn’t have access to the Internet ... If it goes into the next working week it is going to be a nightmare.”","The article titled ""Internet services in Egypt and India disrupted"" discusses a significant disruption caused by a breakdown in an international undersea cable network.

The incident has interrupted voice and data services between Singapore and Indonesia for more than a month and inflicted more damage on the company's afflicted finances.

Indosat's backbone transmission division head Syafnedi said on Friday that the company found the broken undersea cables around Mapur Island, Bintan, Riau Islands province, when it investigated the disruption on its communications between Jakarta and Singapore.

The company then reported its findings to local police.

""We needed Rp 10 billion only to fix the cables. That excludes other stolen materials and losses. Now the situation is back to normal,"" he told reporters in Batam.

""These broken cables have caused us major losses as the voice, data, and internet connections were disrupted for more than a month, from early May until now.""

No figures of losses the company had suffered from disturbed operations are available.

Indosat representatives in Jakarta did not immediately respond to calls and text messages made by The Jakarta Post.

According to Syafnedi, the undersea cables, which were set up in the 1990s, were made of fiber optic comprising steel fibers and other materials.

Riau Police chief Brig. Gen. Endjang Hidayat said the police had secured 418 tons of undersea cables cut into several parts, 12 trucks, one excavator, five boats and diving equipment.

He added that the police had arrested two fences and five divers, all of whom had been named suspects. The suspects are Syamsuri, 32, Awaluddin, 33, Ali Mahmud, 43, Herman, 51, and Nasruddin, 45, while the two fences were Riki, 22, and Edy, 29.

""It's a theft case. There's no indication of sabotaging telecommunications between Indonesia and Singapore,"" Endjang said.

According to Endjang, the suspects allegedly stole the cables from September 2012 until this June at the depth of 30 to 40 meters.

The suspects will be charged with article 363 on theft and face maximum punishment of seven years if found guilty.

Indosat, a publicly listed company, is poised to keep booking losses in the second quarter of the year due to continued downward pressure from foreign exchange and depreciation.

Indosat recorded Rp 71 billion losses in the first quarter largely due to foreign exchange losses, changes in the calculation of depreciation value and high tower leasing costs.

This first quarter loss is 214.4 percent higher than that suffered in the same period last year.

The company also has to pay Rp 4 trillion in debts this year, approximately Rp 1.8 billion of which has been paid in the first semester with internal cash.

Indosat also reported that cellular subscriptions increased 7.4 percent year-on-year to 55.9 million as of the first quarter of 2013, while average revenue per user (ARPU) rose 5.9 percent to Rp 26,500.

However, quarter-to-quarter wise, the number of cellular subscribers decreased 4.4 percent while ARPU fell 1.1 percent. Indosat's former chief commercial officer Erik Meijer attributed the quarterly decrease to ""seasonality.""

**Published Date:** 03/12/2024  
**Author:** Kitsoft  

Two incidents involving submarine communication cables in the Baltic Sea have caused significant concern not only among major telecom providers but also within governments. On 29 November, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the UN agency for digital technology, and the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC), a leading industry organisation supporting submarine cable protection, established the International Advisory Board on Submarine Cable Resilience. This occurred on the same day the restoration of damaged submarine cables was announced. Why such activity, considering cable damage is relatively common—up to 200 incidents occur annually worldwide? The answer likely lies in Russia’s suspected targeting of EU and NATO undersea infrastructure, with the two recent incidents in the Baltic Sea strongly resembling acts of sabotage.

The events of 18 November in the Baltic Sea were suspicious enough to dismiss accidental causes for the submarine cable damage. Resilience experts typically identify three common causes of such incidents:

- Negligence by fishing vessels.  
- Improper anchoring.  
- Natural factors, including ageing equipment and natural disasters.

However, the cases involving cables connecting Germany with Finland and Lithuania with Sweden were far more intriguing. As of writing, the Chinese vessel Yi Peng 3, suspected of causing the damage, remains anchored in the Kattegat Strait under surveillance by Swedish and Danish naval ships. According to monitoring data, the ship had travelled from Russia’s Ust-Luga port, reportedly heading towards Egypt’s Port Said, although its ultimate destination could be different.

#### Suspicious Circumstances

The Yi Peng 3 is a bulk carrier, measuring 225 metres long with a carrying capacity of approximately 40,000 tonnes. If the vessel’s anchor was mishandled, it managed to damage two critical submarine cables simultaneously—a highly unlikely feat.

The Swedish government has issued inquiries to China and is pressing for the vessel to dock at a local port to facilitate investigations. So far, Beijing has not responded to the incident. Interestingly, similar incidents occurred in autumn 2023 and 2022.

On 8 October 2023, submarine cables connecting Estonia to Finland and Sweden were damaged. There were substantiated suspicions that this was not an accident but deliberate interference, coinciding with the presence of only Chinese and Russian ships in the area.

On 21 October 2022, cables in the strait between Scotland and the Shetland Islands were damaged. The suspected saboteur was Russia’s so-called research vessel Akademik Boris Petrov. Initially, the ship’s declared route was from the Baltic Sea through the English Channel to the Atlantic Ocean, en route to South America. However, it deviated significantly, taking a more northern route past British naval bases. A Dutch naval vessel, HNLMS Tromp, intercepted and escorted the Russian vessel out of British waters.

These incidents tend to occur in late autumn, around Western Europe. This timing coincides with the onset of harsh weather, complicating repair efforts, providing a logical explanation for the seasonal pattern.

#### Defending Communication Infrastructure

Submarine cable networks are the backbone of global telecommunications. According to the ITU, approximately 99% of global data traffic relies on these channels. ""More than 99% of international data exchange occurs via submarine cables, making their resilience a global imperative,"" said ITU Secretary-General Doreen Bogdan-Martin. ""The Advisory Board will mobilise global experts to ensure the resilience of this vital digital infrastructure against disasters, accidents, and other risks"", explained Bogdan-Martin.

The restoration of two Baltic Sea cables required ten days of intensive work and specialised equipment unavailable to the affected countries. This situation suggests hostile actors may be testing NATO’s ability to repair and protect cables through monitoring and patrolling. These challenges were a focal point of the “Cold Winds-24” military exercises in the Baltic Sea in late November, involving NATO 30 naval vessels.

The creation of the International Advisory Board on Submarine Cable Resilience is expected to draw greater attention to the issue. While Doreen Bogdan-Martin mentioned ""other causes"" of cable damage in her remarks, the ITU has not yet explicitly named the perpetrators. Perhaps this will change as national governments conduct more thorough investigations.","The article titled 'The Great Undersea Cable War' discusses various incidents involving submarine cables, particularly focusing on damage caused by suspected sabotage in the Baltic Sea.

It provides direct mentions of 'submarine cables' and 'cable damage', highlighting that these cables are crucial for global telecommunications, with approximately 99% of international data exchange occurring through them.

The article treats the topic as a central theme, analyzing the geopolitical implications of these incidents and responses from governments and organizations, such as the establishment of the International Advisory Board on Submarine Cable Resilience.

Therefore, it satisfies the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables."

Jackson School of International Studies","**The Cybersecurity Implications of Chinese Undersea Cable Investment**  

In 2013, BRICS business leaders announced plans to construct a $185 million submarine cable connecting Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. However, more than three years later, the BRICS cable has not come to fruition, presumably due to intra-bloc political differences and challenging domestic economic positions.

China is filling the vacuum left by the BRICS cable. Its companies are the most active investors and builders of submarine cables in the developing world. Between 2012 and 2015, Chinese companies were involved with only 7% of disclosed global submarine cable projects, and exclusively with projects that connected either to the Chinese Mainland, Taiwan, or Hong Kong. In contrast, between 2016 and 2019, Chinese companies will participate in 20% of all cable construction projects, over half of which take place outside the South China Sea.

Chinese companies lag behind only the French company Alcatel-Lucent and the Swiss-owned TE Connectivity in total future submarine cable project activity. While Alcatel and TE Connectivity have had decades to expand and engage with the global market, the market share gained by Chinese companies in a relatively short period of time may signal Chinese market dominance in the near future. The meteoric rise of Chinese companies in submarine cable ownership and construction makes it abundantly clear that the Chinese are here to make an impact on the world of Internet infrastructure.

**Chinese Cable Consortiums and Construction Projects**  

Chinese state-owned telecommunications companies are actively expanding their network of cable consortium partnerships. China Unicom, China Telecom, and China Mobile are three state-owned telecommunications providers listed as owners of the new SeaMeWe-5 cable connecting Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Whereas Chinese companies have traditionally participated only in projects that directly involving Chinese territory, Chinese companies are also investing beyond Asia; for example, China Unicom shares ownership of a cable connecting Cameroon and Brazil.

While state-owned companies join cable ownership consortiums, Huawei Marine Systems is installing multiple submarine cables throughout the world. A 2008 joint venture between the Chinese technology giant Huawei and the British company Global Marine Systems, Huawei Marine Systems is making headlines for its work in Africa. At AfricaCom 2016, Huawei announced plans to build eight new cable systems (two of which are included in the count above, six more of which remain to be announced) connecting the continent and upgrade two existing cables. In the last year, Huawei has also been commissioned to build cables connecting Malaysia, Cambodia, and Thailand, build a national broadband transmission network for Papua New Guinea, construct a new cable for Belize, and partner with LTI on a cable project in Indonesia. Recently completed cables include a joint venture with Ooredoo in the Maldives, and Huawei’s tenth project in Africa.

**China’s New Global Orientation in Political Context**  

China’s rise as a formidable player in ICT development may stem from domestic business policy. Around 2015, the Chinese government gave its telecommunications companies permission to fully expand globally. Before, Chinese companies were more restricted in their global reach, although Huawei managed to participate in a few cable projects, including one connecting Suriname and Guiana, which raised eyebrows as early as 2010. China’s ICT expansion is in line with China’s desire to expand its global reach.

For example, Huawei’s involvement in Africa largely mirrors other investments in non-digital regional infrastructure, which increases China’s influence, helps foster new markets for Chinese goods, and provides Beijing with valuable access to natural resources and agriculture. In other words, sending Chinese telecoms abroad through ownership and construction contracts may ultimately fall in line with Beijing’s long-term political and economic goals.

Demand for Chinese investment and construction is also fueled by a global political climate wary of Western, particularly American, Internet infrastructure. While the BRICS cable may be indefinitely stalled, demand for a BRICS-like cable persists. The elevated role of Chinese telecommunications companies in owning and constructing submarine cables responds to this demand by providing an alternative to previously dominant American-led consortiums. Additionally, many Western cable companies have stopped investing in new cables due to their limited financial returns and the omnipotence of Western connectivity. China remains one of the few partners available to countries seeking to grow their connectivity through undersea cables.

**International Cybersecurity Consequences**  

It is clear that Chinese telecommunications companies are increasing their global orientation and that international contracts may be politically expedient for the Chinese government and amenable to the needs of developing nations. However, many aspects of growing Chinese international activity are opaque. It is unclear how heavily Beijing weighs in on specific decisions, especially in the investment decisions of state-owned companies. The same lack of transparency regarding state and company relationship extends to Huawei Marine Systems, which essentially purchases its market share by offering extraordinarily cost-efficient installation prices. Since constructing submarine cables is often prohibitively expensive, it is a mystery how Huawei remains solvent. Huawei has repeatedly denied receiving subsidies from the government, although Western companies insist that Huawei does in fact receive illegal government assistance, and have been successful at blacklisting Huawei from certain projects in the West.

Concerns over Chinese telecommunications companies’ independence yield important political considerations. While Chinese investment may prove affordable and attractive, history dictates that reliance upon Chinese infrastructure can have deleterious and politically-motivated cybersecurity consequences – one need only consider the case of Vietnam, where Chinese investors have dominated both physical and digital infrastructure development. When Vietnam expressed its disapproval of China’s position on the South China Sea, Chinese investors froze cash flows to projects, leaving Vietnam in limbo. Chinese hackers have also exploited their knowledge of Vietnam’s airport systems – which were provided by the Chinese – to hack and suspend airport computers as well as airline websites. The confluence of extreme Chinese infrastructure dependence and politics in South Asia may not extend to other nations with which China is doing business, but sets a precedent that may leave the international community wary of Chinese partnerships.

Further yet, the Chinese government’s propensity for digital surveillance leaves one questioning the supposedly apolitical nature of increased global cable development. Even if the Chinese aren’t building backdoors into their cables now, they certainly have the potential to do so in the future, and the blurry line between private companies and state interest render cables increasingly accessible to Beijing.","The article discusses 'submarine cables' and 'undersea cables,' which are synonymous with 'cut sea cables.'

As a result, all traffic between Singapore and SEA-ME-WE 5’s Kuakata landing station is down.

On April 17th, BSCPLC had announced that maintenance was due to be undertaken on the cable, which would cause temporary interruption of internet service, although it remains unclear if this maintenance was responsible for the outage.

“My impression based on the report of a temporary outage followed by the current long term outage is that the cable experienced a shunt fault where water penetrated the polyethylene insulation. The repeaters were able short term to compensate but the electrical short grew over time and the connection to the very important Tuas CLS in Singapore was completely lost,” speculated Roderick Beck, who sells subsea capacity to carriers for United Cable Company.

According to local press reports, Bangladesh is still able to access 100 Gbps of capacity from the western portion of the cable, which travels through the Red Sea and the Mediterranean to Toulon, France.

However, SEA-ME-WE 5 is one of only two subsea cables that connect Bangladesh, the other being the much older SEA-ME-WE 4 cable.

SEA-ME-WE 5’s fault means Bangladesh has lost 1.7 Tbps of international capacity. SEA-ME-WE 4 provides 800 Gbps and terrestrial fibre links provide 2.7 Tbps.

Back of a napkin calculation means that the fault has reduced the country’s internet capacity by approximately a third.

BSCPLC gave a timeline of just two or three days to repair the fault, which Beck attributes to the proximity of the fault to supply depots and cable ships.

This is in stark contrast to the cuts seen in the Red Sea last month, for which repairs are still yet to commence due to the instability in that region.

The SEA-ME-WE 5 cable is supplied by NEC and ASN.

Repair work on the notorious AAG undersea cable has finished three days ahead of schedule.  

Vietnam’s millions of internet users can breathe a sigh of relief, with repair work on the Asia America Gateway (AAG) cable completed three days earlier than expected early on Sunday.

The Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group (VNPT) had said earlier the work would continue until June 5. It said that internet connection in the country has resumed full service, meaning web surfers were no longer facing sluggish speed on international websites.

The cable, notorious for frequent breakdowns, encountered a technical problem on May 22, and repair work began three days later. It was the second signal loss on the AAG cable so far this year, following a reset last January.

Connected in November 2009, the $560-million AAG handles more than 60 percent of the country’s international internet traffic. The system runs more than 20,000 kilometers (12,420 miles), connecting Southeast Asia and the U.S., passing through Brunei, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Since its debut, the cable has encountered a ‘very high’ risk of rupture and been under frequent repair, affecting all service providers in Vietnam and weakening confidence of domestic internet users.

The cable suffered technical errors at least five times in 2017.

Vietnam currently has six submarine cable systems, as well as a 120 gigabit channel that runs overland through China. With a download speed of 5.46 megabytes per second, Vietnam's internet speed was ranked 74th out of 189 countries and territories in a global survey of broadband speeds compiled by Cable.co.uk, a U.K. broadband, TV, phone and mobile provider, last August.

Vietnam's average broadband speed was 10 times lower than its Southeast Asian neighbor Singapore, according to the survey. However, the country still managed to trump six other countries in the region.

More than 50 million people in Vietnam, or more than half of the country’s population, are internet users.","The article discusses the repair of the AAG undersea cable, which is a direct reference to the topic of cut sea cables.

India was badly affected by an internet blackout a few days ago. The south-east coast of India, especially Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, were badly hit by cyclone Vardah, and this was the main reason for internet services being affected across the continent. Chennai is one of the major landing points for India’s undersea internet telecommunication links, and the cyclone was responsible for major damage to the undersea submarine cables.

Majority of the internet flows through undersea cables and very little passes through satellites. India receives its data connection from three major landing points, namely Mumbai, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Internet data reaches India through a network of undersea submarine fibre-optic cables owned by telecomm giants such as Singtel, Etisalat, France Telecomm and China Telecomm. The cables run across thousands of miles across the floor of the seabed, connecting different nations to the internet circuit.

When an undersea submarine fibre-optic cable is damaged, it needs to be repaired with top priority as many nations depend on internet networks for data communication. Damaged by earthquakes, ship anchors and fishing trawls, undersea cables often need repairs and maintenance.

Repairing a cable is similar to repairing a punctured tire where the bad rubber is replaced with a new patch. When a fibre-optic cable breaks in mid sea, it is impossible to see the fault directly. Hence, when such incidents take place, the telecom operator has to locate the accident and replace the damaged stretch with a fresh new cable.

First, the telecom operator locates the damaged area by zeroing in on the problematic part. To do this, they send signal pulses through the cable from one end or base station. The damaged area (break) will bounce back the pulse to the signalling site which sent the data. Calculating the time delay from the reflected signal, engineers can zero in on the exact point and area of the problem. Then they send out a large cable repair ship, with fresh optic cables to replace the defective part under the sea. The cable is then lifted from the sea bed using special hooks (grapnel) and dragged onto the ship. The faulty cables are then spliced onboard, joined with a fresh cable, sealed with a watertight and anticorrosive covering and returned back to the seabed. Then the ship sends out the information to the base stations to test the cable again. Once the test signals are reaching the destination, the work is confirmed and the cable is repaired successfully. The data is then switched on and the connection restored. The entire process can take up to 16 hours or more, depending the number of cable breaks, successful repairs, time of day, weather conditions at sea and ships around the area.

Is vital internet infrastructure at risk from new Russian naval capabilities? NATO’s military leadership has warned in recent months that the Russian navy is aggressively probing undersea communications cable networks. These cables form a global infrastructure system that transmits 99 percent of the international data sent over the internet. Should we be concerned? Despite the ominous warnings, defense officials have not provided much specific information about the actual substance of the Russian threat.

In the worst scenario, an attack that cut submarine cables coming into the United States could significantly harm its access to the global internet. Ordinary users would probably experience massive losses in bandwidth, particularly for services such as Google and Facebook that host much of their data overseas. Since most government also relies on commercial internet infrastructure, the outages would also interrupt official communications. Any data hosted outside the U.S. would become nearly inaccessible to U.S. parties and vice versa. For people who depend on the internet in daily life, such an attack would be a national disaster. But it is not clear whether NATO believes Russia has the capability or the intention of attacking cable networks in that fashion.

What is known about this problem can be broken down into four categories: Russia’s cable warfare capabilities, the Russian navy’s potential underwater targets, potential effects from damage to submarine cables, and NATO’s publicly acknowledged efforts to respond to Russia. In this post, I summarize existing information on each of these and then pose outstanding questions about the potential Russian threat. My earlier piece on Lawfare provides more background on submarine cables as well as the international law protecting them.

**Russia’s cable warfare capabilities**

Moscow threatens undersea cables primarily with submarines and spy ships that deploy deep-sea submersibles. At DefenseOne, a national security news site from Atlantic Media, Magnus Nordenman detailed how Russia has converted ballistic missile subs to deploy the highly secretive AS-12 Losharik deep-sea submarine. The Losharik can dive down thousands of meters, enabling it to target cables at depths that would be very difficult to repair.

The most prominent Russian spy ship is the Yantar. Classified as an ""oceanographic research vessel,"" the Yantar on its 2015 voyage probing a cable route to Cuba provoked some of the first reporting that Russia was targeting cables. That trip drew attention to the Yantar’s capabilities for intelligence operations. It carries advanced surveillance equipment, including a remotely operated underwater vehicle and two manned submersibles that the BBC reported can dive about 6,000 meters. For context, the average depth of the ocean floor is about 3,700 meters.

With all its advanced gear, the Yantar has been busy since it came into service in 2015. The ship deployed off a U.S. submarine base in Georgia in 2015, located the wrecks of crashed Russian fighter jets in the eastern Mediterranean in 2016 and assisted in the search for a missing Argentine submarine in 2017. The Russian navy is scheduled to complete construction on a second Yantar-class ship in 2019 and to begin building a third in 2020.

Underwater submersibles can damage cables. But it is not certain whether they can tap cable communications underwater in the same way that human operatives can tap fiber-optic cables on land. The BBC article about the Yantar noted a Russian report that the ship has devices that can tap undersea cables to obtain the data flowing through them. According to the Register, a British technology news site, tapping fiber-optic cables underwater requires opening up armored sheaths, avoiding shocks from the cable’s power supply and then splicing open highly sensitive glass fibers. Thousands of meters underwater this would be impossible for a diver or clumsy submersible. The New York Times reported in 2005 that the USS Jimmy Carter, a highly advanced submarine that was the only one of its class built, had a capability to tap undersea cables. An Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers report speculated that a 45-foot extension added to the Jimmy Carter provided this capability by allowing engineers to bring the cable up into a floodable chamber to install a tap. But it is unlikely that the USS Jimmy Carter routinely taps cables since U.S. intelligence agencies can much more easily (and lawfully) obtain cable data through taps at above-ground cable landing stations. There are no reports of Russian subs with similar capabilities. Submersibles would be too small to have the same kind of chamber as the Jimmy Carter. Therefore, it is not at all certain if Russia can credibly claim that the Yantar can tap cables.

**What is Russia targeting?**

The Russian naval activity is probably not aimed solely at commercial communications cables. Reports in 2015 about the Yantar’s voyage off the southeastern U.S. coast indicated that defense officials suspected the spy ship was mapping underwater sensors and equipment used by submarines at the Kings Bay, Ga., naval base. Other reports suggested that Russian naval activity was targeting military-operated cables that do not show up on normal maps. These systems would likely be highly classified. The Pentagon has laid publicly acknowledged cables connecting Miami to the naval base at Guantanamo Bay and is planning a cable from Guantanamo to Puerto Rico. These cables are part of the DODIN—the term for the Defense Department’s communications networks. The agency that manages the DODIN plans to build a communications cable network in the Caribbean. But it is not clear if these are the only cables that agency manages.

In addition to cables, the Russian activity may be directed at military underwater sensing equipment. The Integrated Undersea Surveillance System (IUSS) is the Navy’s name for the array of fixed and mobile acoustic arrays that provide its primary means for detecting submarines. It was a potent tool for tracking Soviet submarines during the Cold War and only because of information provided by a submarine officer turned Soviet spy. Earlier this year, an expert on the Russian military recounted that during the 1970s, U.S. intelligence concluded that a Russian submarine had cut off an underwater hydrophone that was part of the predecessor to the IUSS. Although the IUSS faded in importance after the collapse of the Soviet Union, it remains in operation. With the dramatic increase in Russian submarine activity in recent years, the system is newly relevant to the U.S. and to NATO.

**Effects of a potential attack on undersea cables**

Hundreds of cables criss-cross the oceans. They provide the connectivity that allows Microsoft to keep major data centers in Ireland and to have that data nearly instantly accessible to U.S. customers. Although each undersea cable transmits huge quantities of data, the cable network has significant redundancy.

**By: Yuka Koshino**  
**Published Date: 02/07/2025**  

Expanding the EU’s role in the Indo-Pacific  
The rapid development of digital technologies has dramatically increased global internet bandwidth demand, with submarine cables today accounting for nearly 99% of intercontinental data traffic. These undersea cables are the backbone of global communications and the internet economy. Despite their critical importance, these cables remain inadequately protected, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region.

Globally, approximately 100-200 cases of damage to undersea cables are reported annually according to the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC). Most of these incidents are accidental, typically caused by fishing or anchoring. Physical protection measures, such as burial in shallow waters and electronic monitoring of anomalies, along with legal regulations, all contribute to cable security. However, much of the responsibility for protecting these cables lies with operators, limiting private-public cooperation and creating vulnerabilities, whether during times of peace, ‘grey zone’ situations or at moments of crisis. Ensuring seamless protection that spans from peacetime to periods of potential volatility remains a significant challenge.

The Indo-Pacific, a region marked by complex geopolitics and rising tensions, faces unique challenges in ensuring the security of its submarine cables. For the European Union, whose interests in the region are framed by its 2021 Indo-Pacific Strategy, the vulnerabilities related to this critical infrastructure pose a strategic risk, calling for more proactive measures to manage them.

**Europe's experience: Lessons from the Nord Stream incident**  
The sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines in September 2022 amid Russia’s war in Ukraine served as a wake-up call for Europe. It exposed the vulnerability of undersea infrastructure and underscored the urgent need to accelerate efforts to improve national and regional capabilities to collectively protect and repair critical subsea assets. In response, NATO increased its maritime patrols, surveillance and exercises aimed at safeguarding critical undersea infrastructure. It also established new mechanisms such as the Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure and the Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cells which facilitate information sharing among allies, partners and private sector stakeholders.

Several EU Member States have launched their own initiatives, including the Critical Seabed Infrastructure Protection project, aimed at enhancing the operational efficiency of underwater assets in the region. The EU-NATO Task Force on the resilience of critical infrastructure has also conducted a comprehensive assessment of Europe’s undersea infrastructure, identifying key challenges and providing recommendations for improvement. However, similar efforts are largely absent in Asia, leaving the region vulnerable and exposed. This also directly affects the EU’s interests in the region as articulated in the 2021 EU Strategy for Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.

**Emerging challenges from China**  
Several trends involving China are also raising concerns about the security of undersea cables in the Indo-Pacific and, by extension, the EU’s interests in the region.

First, Chinese companies are rapidly expanding their presence in the submarine cable construction and repair industry. Since its establishment in 2008, China’s HMN Tech (formerly Huawei Marine) has emerged as the fourth-largest submarine cable builder in the world, behind the US’s SubCom, France’s Alcatel Submarine Networks (ASN) and Japan’s NEC. Backed by Chinese government subsidies under the Digital Silk Road (DSR) – the digital arm of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) – Chinese firms had reportedly built or repaired almost 100 of the world’s 400 submarine cables by 2021. Despite holding a global market share of less than 10%, China’s strategic influence is growing.

The primary concern here is security. Under China’s National Intelligence Law of 2017, Chinese companies are required to cooperate with intelligence efforts. This has led to fears that backdoors could easily be inserted during the construction and repair process, potentially enabling surveillance or sabotage. In 2018, the Japanese government reportedly discovered a Chinese wiretapping device on a cable near Okinawa, confirming the security risks posed by increased Chinese involvement in the global cable network in the vicinity of geopolitical hotspots.

A second concern is growing Chinese interference in both ongoing and new cable construction projects in the South China Sea. In recent years, lengthy permit processing times and other bureaucratic roadblocks have resulted in construction delays for major projects, including the Southeast Asia-Japan 2 (SAJ2) cable connecting Japan to Singapore by way of Taiwan and Hong Kong. There is speculation that given Beijing’s increasing control over cable construction projects in the South China Sea, these delays could be a form of retaliation against the exclusion of Chinese vendors from such infrastructure ventures. Still others suggest that governance gaps and differing interpretations of international law—such as Article 7 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) — enable China to impose stricter permit requirements beyond internationally recognised territorial waters.

Finally, there is the risk posed by Beijing’s potential use of cables in a regional contingency, especially in Taiwan’s remote islands in the East China Sea. Since 2020, Chinese sand-dredgers have been swarming around the Matsu Islands – part of Taiwan and located just 20 km away from mainland China – scooping sand from the seabed, often damaging undersea infrastructure, disrupting local economies and intimidating residents. In February 2023, a Chinese fishing vessel and a cargo ship cut two cables, leaving the island with limited internet access for 50 days. While it remains unclear whether the damage was deliberate, this incident further highlights how Taiwan’s communication resiliency could be challenged in the face of future potential cable sabotage in a contingency scenario.

**Regional responses and gaps**  
Regional coordination on submarine cable security in the Indo-Pacific has been fragmented, largely due to the lack of region-wide formal security institutions, akin to the EU or NATO. Additionally, different countries in the region have varying levels of threat perception, further complicating coordinated action.

The US, Japan and Australia have taken the lead in countering these threats, but their efforts to date have primarily focused on preventing the expansion of high-risk Chinese vendors within the region’s submarine networks. The Trilateral Infrastructure Partnership, developed under the aegis of the Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) framework, and signed in 2018, serves as the main platform for promoting infrastructure development by trusted vendors. Under this framework, projects like Palau’s 2020 second cable, connecting it to the Southeast Asia-United States (SEA-US) network, and the 2023 East Micronesia Cable, connecting Micronesia, Kiribati and Nauru, are examples of these efforts. Also in 2023, the Quad (comprising the US, Japan, Australia and India) launched its Quad Partnership for Cable Connectivity and Resilience, aimed at supporting cable construction as well as providing cybersecurity capacity building and technical assistance for the security of the region’s cables. However, this initiative has yet to yield tangible results.

Despite these efforts, regional responses to deter malicious attacks, as well as to protect and repair cables, remain sluggish and inadequate. To begin with, there is often a lack of clarity over which agencies are primarily responsible for submarine cable protection, creating further hurdles for effective regional cooperation. In the case of Japan, despite being a key regional hub for trans-oceanic submarine networks hosting 20 cables, government policy papers did not address the need to protect submarine cables or their landing stations until 2023. Furthermore, the role of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces has yet to be clarified, despite the government’s emphasis on civil-military cooperation for critical infrastructure protection under the 2022 National Security Strategy. These discrepancies create obstacles to conducting joint exercises and impede information-sharing between allies, hindering coordinated efforts to respond to threats.

Gaps in seabed surveillance technologies, and limited cable-laying and repairing capacities, further jeopardise the security of regional submarine cables. The Guidelines for Strengthening Resilience and Repair of Submarine Cables, released by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2019, represent an important step towards streamlining permit processes for cable repairs. However, ASEAN has yet to launch a comprehensive initiative to tackle the broader challenges facing regional cables.

**The EU's role: Opportunities for greater engagement**  
The EU’s 2018 vision for connecting Europe and Asia, articulated through the Global Gateway initiative, and the EU-Japan Digital Partnership have laid some groundwork for addressing these challenges. However, the EU’s role in ensuring submarine cable security in the Indo-Pacific remains limited.

One notable EU initiative is the Far North Fiber project, which aims to connect Europe and Japan via the Arctic, bypassing critical chokepoints in the South China and Red Seas.","The article titled 'The changing submarine cables landscape' discusses various aspects of submarine cables, which includes direct mentions of 'undersea cables' and 'submarine cables'.

Vietnamese government officials said today that it will take at least a month to fix a critical undersea data cable damaged by fishermen scavenging for scrap copper.

The 560Mbit/sec. fiber-optic cable, which connects Vietnam with Hong Kong and Thailand, is one of two that provides the bulk of the country's connection with the Internet. Hanoi blamed the damage on fishermen, who pulled lines from the seabed thinking that they were copper cables laid by the U.S. or the former Republic of South Vietnam before 1975.

According to the state-run Viet Nam News (VNS) news service and Web site, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung has called on authorities to stop such thefts. At least five cases have been documented since January, VNS added, including the recent seizure of two fishing boats carrying about 80 tons of cable, which the fishermen intended to sell as scrap.

Today, VNS quoted Tran Duc Lai, the deputy minister of posts and telematics, saying that it would take at least 30 days to repair the fiber-optic cable. ""This is the first time that fishermen cut an undersea cable to sell as scrap,"" Lai told VNS. ""It is a serious threat to national security, socio-economic development, and Vietnam's international prestige.""

As much as 61 miles of cable must be replaced, said Lai.

Until the repair is completed, Vietnam's connection to the Internet depends on a 10Gbit/sec. cable that links the country to China, Hong Kong and Singapore.

""To prevent a repeat of the situation, we have to take urgent measures like increasing fishermen's awareness of the importance of underwater cables, increasing patrols in areas that have undersea cables, and stringent punishment for those violating the law,"" Lai said.

Last December, major earthquakes off the coast of Taiwan damaged several undersea cables and disrupted telephone and Internet service to and from China, Hong Kong, Singapore and other countries in the region. Most repairs were completed by the end of January.

Published Sep 19, 2018 6:36 PM by **Jacob Styczynski**  

Submarine cables and the internet traffic they carry, including as much as 99 percent of international telecommunications data, have been a focus area for government officials in recent months. In June 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned entities supporting Russia's ""underwater capabilities,"" citing concerns of Russian activity ""tracking undersea communication cables."" The sanctions shortly followed the re-establishment of a NATO command post tracking Russian submarines in December 2017, prompted by the same concerns of Russian activity near submarine cables.  

Australian officials have sounded similar alarms regarding control of submarine cables. Recently, the head of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) directly intervened in negotiations to prevent Chinese firm Huawei from receiving a contract to lay cable providing internet to the Solomon Islands, citing Chinese ownership of a cable connected to Australia's network infrastructure as an unacceptable cybersecurity risk. Ultimately, in a deal finalized in June 2018, Australia agreed to cover two thirds of the construction costs using foreign aid funds to ensure an Australian firm received the award.  

Despite security apprehensions regarding submarine cables, attempts to interfere with their infrastructure are blunted by a number of factors. For example, clandestinely intercepting data on cables would likely be impeded by physical constraints, network operators' ability to monitor for atypical activity and an inability to make use of intercepted data, as nearly three quarters of internet traffic is encrypted in transit.  

Cable breaks are a relatively common occurrence today, and as many as 100 breaks occur per year on average; two thirds of which are the result of accidents involving commercial vessels. A more realistic threat is disrupting internet access by intentionally severing the cables. While some officials have warned that such attacks could ""immediately and potentially catastrophically"" impact the economy, redundant infrastructure would also limit the effects of these accidents and attacks.  

There are instances in which cable breaks can have outsized impacts, including incidents of simultaneous cable breaks or breaks within regions lacking redundant infrastructure. In 2006, an earthquake simultaneously severed eight cables off the coast of Taiwan, resulting in the loss of 90 percent of the data traffic between China, the U.S. and Europe. Similarly, in an incident in 2008, two cables carrying 90 percent of internet traffic through the Suez Canal were broken, obstructing internet access for 75 million people across North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia.  

Given the global nature of the maritime industry, and the need for offices and shoreside IT infrastructure, maritime organizations may be particularly vulnerable to disruptions of limited infrastructure serving isolated regions. While private sector organizations may have little control over nation-state activities targeting submarine cables, they can factor disruptive risks stemming from cable breaks, intentional or accidental, into decisions regarding the IT infrastructure used at sites around the world.  

To mitigate the impact of submarine cable breaks, companies can conduct assessments with their network carriers to identify sites in regions that lack cable redundancy. To prevent any incidents from occurring, companies can lease more fiber, engage with a separate ISP for backup or ensure critical data at sites without redundant connectivity are backed-up at facilities in other regions.

It will take three weeks to repair the damage. In the meantime, the Internet in Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Juba, the capital of South Sudan, is functioning at a reduced speed. It will impede the normal flow by about 20 percent, according to the BBC's Nairobi correspondent, Noel Mwakugu.

The Indian Ocean East Africa Marine Systems (TEAMS) cable, which connects East Africa to the United Arab Emirates, was severed when a ship dropped anchor in a restricted area – restricted because of the presence of the sea cabling. The Teams cable was carrying redirected traffic from the earlier cutting of three other cables in the Red Sea, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The outage comes at a time when Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, has assumed a much greater profile as a center of technological innovation and entrepreneurship, largely due to the recent availability of fast, reliable broadband connections. These undersea fiber-optic cables, laid in 2009 and which connect Africa to the world, have kicked off Kenya's high-tech industry and prompted an increase in Kenyan Internet users from 1.8 million to 3.1 million in the first year.

Bitenge Ndemo, Kenya's permanent secretary in the Ministry of Information and Communications, says that the cost of the internet outage could reach $500 million by the time repairs are finished.

""We do not have the cost yet but it runs into millions of dollars since TEAMS and EASSY carry almost 70 percent of the traffic from the East African Region,"" Mr. Ndemo told the Monitor. ""Most providers had cut off satellite thinking we have sufficient redundancy,"" Ndemo adds, and the Kenyan government has urged other new cable lines to land elsewhere to prevent future line cuts in the high-traffic sea-lanes outside Mombasa.

In the meantime, Kenya's losses have been significant. ""There have been major disruptions and loss of revenue in the past few days,"" Ndemo says. ""In my estimation we shall have lost up to $500 million by the time we are reconnected.""

Jessica Colaço, the manager of iHub, a high-tech incubator in Nairobi, estimates that the cut in Internet service will affect an estimated 10,000 people in Nairobi who work in the tech industry. All of those people, along with larger companies who have started to locate in the city -- such as Google, Microsoft, and Samsung -- will suffer the frustration of a substantial slow-down until the cable is repaired.

In addition to work taking longer, and therefore costing more, a slowing in the rate of information carried online could also cause multiple websites and online services to ""time out."" A time out is a limit on the duration allowed for an online instruction to be followed and is configured on a server-by-server or client-by-client basis. A time out will require a user to begin the process of retrieval again (and again). In many cases, users will never access the information at all, bringing work to a standstill for the duration of the repair.

“It is difficult to make an exact analysis [of the effects], because one cannot be sure about the amount of redundancy that is built into most of the operator networks to deal with something like this,” Paul Kukubo, CEO of Kenya’s ICT Board, said by email. 

“But the visible effects are that there has been a considerable slowdown on some Internet network speeds. Some service providers have been affected in terms of quality due to this, especially because the TEAMS networks provide high speed broadband that many have come to depend on. We have seen some slowdown on some government networks as well,” Mr. Kukubo said. 

“Computer users are used to the Internet malfunctioning, of course. But for most, malfunctions rarely can be traced to a single act of negligence, or greed, by a named individual. The Mombasa anchor episode, in this sense, resembles an incident in which an Armenian retiree in the Caucasian nation of Georgia brought down the Internet. 

As with the shovel incident, the Mombasa anchor incident is an unwelcome reminder that the high-minded world of technology remains vulnerable to physical human error.

TEAMS is owned by the Kenyan government, in conjunction with Etelisat, an Emirati company. It was created as an alternative to the South Africa-owned EASSy, or East African Submarine Cable System.","The article discusses the severing of the TEAMS undersea cable caused by a ship's anchor, leading to significant internet outages across six East African countries.

But who is the enemy?  

*   Why can I picture George Dubbya Bush in a scuba suit, holding a giant pair of sheers and screaming ""I'll cut off the terrorist's interweb tubes!""  
        *   I doubt it. If anything, we would want Iran to have 100% free and uncensored access for all citizens.  
            *   Our government doesn't want that for us so why would they want it for others?  
                *   Because an informed populace promotes change, especially when grave injustices are being done and the local government is shielding its populace from it. Elected US officials don't want an informed populace because they would be putting their own political lives on the line. That and infrastructure is expensive.  
                    *   (Posted in code so they can't understand it:)  
                        You are positing a hertofore unshown level of intelegence and understanding of the complexities of the mindset of countries other than the USA in the USA's current leadership. I respectfully suggest that they are more likely to try the direct approach, despite the accilary effects strengthening their enemies position. This seems to meet with the past record of those leaders actions.  
                            I don't see this as a reasonable action for Iran, if Iran were contemplating military action.  
                            *   *   The problem here is that this type of warning says: ""Time for you to set up a non-hardline source for Internet access."" That's why I don't really think it's a warning so much as a precursor to military action, or an action in and of itself, for instance to interfere with Iran's plans to set up a Euro-based oil market. I believe that they (as a country) are a net importer of oil, however this doesn't really reflect on an oil market. The USA is also a net importer of oil, and we certainly have oil markets. A market in Euros (further) destabilizes the dollar, and I would imagine that such things are on the front burner for our chief executive's advisers these days.","The article titled 'Fifth Cable Cut To Middle East' directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables, noting that the total number of incidents has reached five.

In a bizarre coincidence, a ship allegedly dropped anchor off the coast of Kenya on Saturday in a restricted area, cutting The East African Marine Systems (TEAMS) cable - shortly after three other cables were chopped in the Red Sea between Djibouti and the Middle East, the _Wall Street Journal_ reported.

TEAMS was already stuffed with the traffic from the other three cables, the Europe India Gateway (EIG), the South East Asia Middle East Western Europe-3 (SMW-3) and the Eastern Africa Submarine Cable System (EASSY), which were severed ten days before.

""It's a very unusual situation,"" Chris Wood, chief executive of West Indian Ocean Cable, the largest shareholder of the EASSY, and a major owner of data-capacity rights on the two other Red Sea cables. ""I believe these were accidental incidents, although more will be known when we bring the cables up from the sea bed.""

Naturally, the number of cables ruined in a short timeframe has sparked suspicions of sabotage. A source from African carrier Airtel told Ugandan independent newspaper the _Daily Monitor_ that the cables had been sliced on purpose.

""The EASSY and TEAMS cables were cut by malicious people at the weekend and this is causing connection problems. All internet providers, particularly Orange and Airtel have been affected because they all depend on these cables for service provision,” he said.

Wood told the _WSJ_ that the cables in the Red Sea had all been severed at the same time, around 650 feet below the Red Sea, but he said that a passing ship could have done the damage because the sea is so shallow.

He added that these cables should be fixed in the next three weeks.

Joel Tanui, general manager of the TEAMS cable, gave the same timescale for fixes to that cable.

""We wish to notify all our stakeholders of ongoing emergency repair works and apologise unreservedly for any inconvenience this may cause,"" he said. ""The cable should be fully operational within the next three weeks.""

BERLIN — Chinese scientists have been researching ways to cut undersea cables since at least the late 2000s, according to a recent report in the U.S. magazine Newsweek. The revelation comes amid a series of events in which undersea infrastructure in geopolitically tense regions was damaged under unclear circumstances.

Reporters at Newsweek uncovered two patent applications Chinese researchers filed for towed undersea cable-cutting devices and associated methods to inflict such damage.

The patent applications, which the magazine reported were both ultimately dropped for unknown reasons, show devices shaped similarly to anchors that are meant to be dragged along the ocean floor to dig up and sever undersea cables.

There is a striking similarity to recent events of purported sabotage of undersea cables by ostensibly civilian vessels dragging their anchors along the seabed. This happened in the Baltic Sea, severing communications and data transfer cables. It has also recently occurred close to Taiwan. The island, which has governed itself ever since the Chinese Civil War, is claimed by Beijing as part of China. President Xi Jinping has made it clear that annexation – or reunification, as Beijing calls it – is a central policy of his term.

Policymakers and experts have called these incidents acts of “hybrid warfare” and sabotage.

The more recent of the two patent applications was developed in 2020 by a group of engineers from Lishui University. The institution is located in Zhejiang province, just across the strait from Taiwan. The invention was filed as a “dragging type submarine cable cutting device.” Newsweek quoted the document’s authors as saying that “with the development of science and technology, more and more submarine cables and communication cables are laid on the seabed of all parts of the world and the cables need to be cut off in some emergency situations.”

The magazine also discovered an application from a coastal research institution in the south of China from 2009 for a similar device. That application referenced the need to be able to counteract “illegal” cables off Chinese shores, a purported use case that experts dismissed as being highly unlikely.

In response to the story, the Chinese embassy in D.C. told Newsweek that “the Chinese government had always welcomed and supported other countries and telecommunications companies laying international submarine cables in waters under China’s jurisdiction.” The spokesperson said China would “continue to work with the international community to actively promote the construction of global information infrastructure such as submarine cables, jointly protect submarine cables, and work together to build a community with a shared future in cyberspace.”

As a knock-on effect of the global geopolitical instability precipitated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, undersea infrastructure has become an area of focus and concern. In the Baltic Sea, countries are stepping up countermeasures after Chinese-owned ships operating out of Russian ports were involved in several incidents where pipelines and cables were damaged by dragged anchors.

It is unclear to what extent the Chinese government was involved in recent cable-cutting incidents involving apparently civilian ships in the Baltic Sea. In at least one of the incidents, the Chinese government has publicly called the event an “accident.”

Experts have also voiced concern that as part of Beijing’s pressure tactics surrounding Taiwan, attacks on undersea infrastructure could be used as a gray-zone, hybrid-warfare tactic.

Linus holds a degree in journalism, political science and international studies, and is currently pursuing a master’s in nonproliferation and terrorism studies.","The article discusses Chinese scientists' research into cutting undersea cables, particularly highlighting two patent applications for devices designed to sever these cables.

It details the geopolitical context of undersea cable damage, citing specific incidents in the Baltic Sea and near Taiwan, where undersea infrastructure has been compromised.

Work on the undersea connection will be completed on August 25, four days behind schedule.

Repair work on of Vietnam’s ruptured undersea internet cable will not be completed until 5.30 p.m. on August 25 due to adverse weather conditions, according to internet provider Asia America Gateway (AAG).

This is the second delay announced in three days. On Saturday, AAG said repair work would be completed on August 24, three days behind the original schedule.

Typhoon Dianmu, which hit northern provinces over the weekend, has hindered maintenance work, according to AAG.

In early August, Typhoon Nida broke two segments of the AAG cable, one located 80 kilometers from Hong Kong and the other 32 kilometers from Singapore.

In 2015 alone, the AAG ruptured three times, while in 2014 it went down twice.

This year, the cable system has experienced problems in March and June, heavily affecting outbound internet traffic.

Vietnam has four submarine cable systems, and the AAG was connected in November 2009 with a length of over 20,000 kilometers and a design capacity of 2 terabit/second, directly connecting Southeast Asia with America.

In addition to submarine cable systems, Vietnam has a land-based system with a capacity of 120 gigabit/second that goes through China, and there are plans to build another one.","The article titled ""Repairs to Vietnam's notorious internet cable delayed, yet again"" directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables by discussing the repair of the AAG (Asia America Gateway) undersea internet cable that was damaged by Typhoon Nida.

But what if you could switch off 1.28 terabits—four times as much bandwidth—with nothing more high-tech than an axe?

That’s what three men tried to do in an unsophisticated but effective form of sabotage in Egypt yesterday; their identities and motives are not yet known. Reuters reports the Egyptian coastguard intercepted a fishing boat off the coast of Alexandria and arrested three men trying to cut through the SEA-ME-WE 4 undersea cable. The cable is one of the main connections between Asia and Europe, running from France to Malaysia and linking Italy, north Africa, the middle east and south Asia. The men, whose pictures the navy uploaded on Facebook, are being interrogated by Egyptian authorities.

The Internet does not live in anything resembling a cloud, as Andrew Blum memorably put it in Tubes, his book about the net’s physical infrastructure. Instead it resides in hundreds of cables snaking underground and along the bottom of the sea, where it is susceptible to ship anchors, marine life, and sabotage.

Most big countries have several redundant cables landing on their shores. But the loss of even a single one means that all the traffic must be jammed through remaining connections, causing congestion. And there is nothing to stop determined attackers from targeting several cables. Indeed, since many cables go through geographic chokepoints like the Suez, it wouldn’t be difficult to disrupt a whole bunch of connections in a brief period of time.

That’s exactly the kind of attack that seems to be underway. The past week saw reports of several severed cables off the coast of Egypt that are part of Seacom, a network of cables serving much of Africa. At the time, Seacom officials suspected careless ships. But the arrest of the three men yesterday suggests there could a concerted effort to take down Egypt’s connectivity. A similar spate of cuts affected the region in 2008, though no culprit was officially established.

Yesterday’s attacks on the Internet’s infrastructure—Cyberbunker and the Egyptian cable—show two ways of waging asymmetric war in the Internet era. If your aim is a single company, it helps to know how to wrangle thousands of zombie computers into a precise, targeted attack. That also has the benefit of allowing regular users—and the attackers themselves—to stay online. But if your target is bigger, say a country or a continent, all it takes to cripple the network is scuba gear and a few sharp-edged tools.","The article discusses the SEA-ME-WE 4 undersea cable and an incident where individuals attempted to cut it.

February 6th, 2008 —  

First off, I want to thank everyone for the positive feedback that I have received for my last post, which illustrated the locations of the 5 submarine cables that have been damaged over the past couple of weeks. I’m glad to see that some news sites such as Slashdot featured my post and that people are starting to take a critical look at what is happening.

That being said, I’m sure that everyone is eager to read the results of my findings on why these cables may have been damaged, who has to gain from the damages, and where we, as concerned citizens, should start to look for answers.

Before I begin, I would like to point out that these findings are from my own research. I am not accusing anyone of anything here. I am simply providing a resource for the rest of the internet so that people can start to investigate what may really be happening over there. There are some facts out there that are just too big to ignore.

We have been told by various organizations that these damages are attributed to power failures or by an anchor being accidentally dragged along the ocean floor during a storm. However, it doesn’t take more than a 5th grade education to start to recognize that there may, in fact, be a pattern to what we are seeing here. When something like this occurs, it starts the mind roaming around the possibilities as to why this may have occurred.

### #4 – Big Telecom Companies  
In talking to a network operations manager about the damages that have been done to the cables, the first companies that he suggested, which stand to gain from this type of damage, are the larger telecommunications companies. Especially the land-based ones. Here’s why: when a huge pipeline providing tons of information to a particular area is damaged, re-routing almost always occurs before repair. This means, that the companies which surround the outage or are within the outage area stand to benefit from the sudden jump in needed bandwidth.

So, which companies have some ties into this mess? Well, there are a few companies that popped up while doing my research. However, for the scope of this article, let’s look at Verizon Business. To start things off, Verizon partially owns the SeaMeWe-4 cable that was severed. According to them the repairs could take days but they were going to offer an alternative network as quickly as possible. Alternative meaning, routing through somewhere else. How else might Verizon be involved with this deal? Verizon Business has ownership in many of the submarine cables that have been in recent news. In addition, they began work in 2007 on a new cable that will render others obsolete.

### #3 – December 2007  
In December of 2007, there were a few events that occurred related directly to the damages that we have recently seen. 

### #2 – Reliance Communications and FLAG  
First of all, you need to understand that Reliance Communications is part of a massive company that, grouped with Reliance Telecom and Flag Telecom, makes up Reliance Communications Ventures.

### #1 – The Iranian Oil Bourse  
Through the research that I have exhaustingly done over the past few days, this is the one that has struck me as the most likely reason for the damages that have occurred to submarine internet cables. First, a bit of background. A bourse is a, typically European, word which refers to a stock exchange.","The article discusses submarine cables extensively, including direct mentions of damages to these cables and the implications for telecommunications companies.

"2024 East Africa Submarine Cable Outage Report","Analyzes the May 2024 outages of SEACOM and EASSy cables, impacting internet connectivity for millions; emphasizes the need for resilience in critical communication infrastructure.","https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2024/2024-east-africa-submarine-cable-outage-report","2024-07-23T12:00:00.000Z","",Yes,"Ben Roberts","Reston, Virginia, USA","5000","2024-07-23","English","Internet Society","**2024 East Africa Submarine Cable Outage Report**

On 12 May 2024, two fiber optic submarine cables—SEACOM and EASSy—were damaged off the coast of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, significantly reducing Internet connectivity in multiple East African countries. The cause of the damage is a suspected dragging ship anchor, a common source of submarine cable cuts.

All cables were repaired as of 3 June 2024—approximately three weeks after the initial damage.

This report highlights the impact of these submarine cable cuts on local connectivity and the importance of developing resilience to maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of such faults.

### The Importance of Submarine Cables

Fibre optic submarine cables are critical communication infrastructures that form the backbone of international Internet connectivity. Currently, around 559 submarine cable systems span 1.5 million kilometers, connecting the smallest Pacific islands to the largest economies of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.

In 2009, the first submarine fiber cables were activated on East Africa’s coast, providing an alternative to satellite connectivity to many countries in the sub-region. Not only did these cables reduce latency in the sub-region by 400%, but they also reduced Internet costs by more than 50%—at the time, one megabit per second (Mbps) of satellite capacity cost roughly USD 2,000 per month or higher.

Since then, five more submarine fiber cables have been commissioned to connect East African countries south of Kenya.

While these submarine cables predominantly benefit the countries that connect directly to them via coastal landing stations, neighboring landlocked countries also benefit via terrestrial cross-border fiber connections.

Table 1 shows the submarine cables and terrestrial cross-border cables that provide connectivity to each country in the sub-region.

Although it is difficult to measure the amount of traffic flowing along submarine and terrestrial cables, it’s estimated that 2,000 Gigabits per second of traffic is exchanged within the sub-region.

Ben Roberts, Group CTIO of Liquid Intelligent Technologies, notes that most of this traffic exchange is with South Africa, where several hyperscale cloud services are located.

Burundi, Malawi, Mozambique, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda rely predominantly on SEACOM and EASSy to access these hyperscale cloud services in South Africa and were, as such, the most affected countries during the outage.

Luckily, no country experienced a total Internet outage due to the availability of other operational submarine and cross-border terrestrial routes, Internet Exchange Points, and local content caches.

### The Importance of IXPs

An IXP is a physical place, sometimes inside a data center, where different networks interconnect and send traffic to one another. IXPs also provide insight into local traffic connectivity. The more networks connect at an IXP, the more insight an IXP has.

The Internet Society has carried out many activities to support the establishment and growth of IXPs in the countries affected by this outage.

### The Importance of Locally Available Content

IXPs also often host or provide access to Content Delivery Network (CDN) caching servers that serve popular traffic locally.

Following the 12 May outage, Ugandan Internet Society Chapter member Lilian Achom reported having challenges accessing social media pages and e-learning resources.

### The Importance of Redundancy and Cooperation

The Internet is designed so that when one route does not work, traffic can be automatically rerouted via another. The more routes to and from destinations, the greater the redundancy when one route is affected, and the less likely users will be affected or notice any performance issues.

While IXPs and CDN caches help to offset the impact of international cable outages, the events of 12 May highlighted the level of international connectivity redundancy that countries have in the region.","The article titled ""2024 East Africa Submarine Cable Outage Report"" discusses significant incidents involving the damage of submarine cables, specifically the SEACOM and EASSy cables, which occurred on May 12, 2024.

It details the impact of these outages on internet connectivity in multiple East African countries, highlighting that the damage was likely caused by a dragging ship anchor, a common source of submarine cable cuts.

The report emphasizes the critical role of submarine cables in international internet connectivity and discusses how the outages affected local connectivity, the importance of developing resilience, and the reliance of several countries on these cables for access to services.

This thorough examination of the implications of cut sea cables, along with specific examples and discussions of their impact on telecommunications, confirms that the article treats the topic as a central theme rather than a minor mention."
"Damage to Fourth Undersea Cable Sparks Conspiracy Theories","Examines the effects of undersea cable damage on global connectivity, linking it to conspiracy theories surrounding the incidents.","https://callcenterinfo.tmcnet.com/analysis/articles/20044-damage-fourth-undersea-cable-sparks-conspiracy-theories.htm","2008-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","By Erik Linask - Group Editorial Director",Yes,"Erik Linask","Shelton, Connecticut, United States","20000","2008-02-05","English","TMCnet","**Damage to Fourth Undersea Cable Sparks Conspiracy Theories**  
February 05, 2008  

When three undersea cables providing connectivity in the Middle East and westward to Europe and North America were cut last week in the Middle East, the impact was immediate — and significant — as many with connections in the region were shut off from Internet communications. That meant VoIP service, IM, and email were suddenly unavailable.  

Now, repair work has begun on one of the three severed cables, with a second repair vessel expected to begin servicing a second line imminently, with hopes that service to the Middle East and Asia would soon be restored.  

Sunday, however, a fourth cable connecting Qatar and the UAR has also been cut, though apparently for a different reason. The first three, in the Mediterranean Sea and Persian Gulf, are said to have been severed by dragging anchors — though various reports claim that explanation has been retracted by the Egyptian Transport Ministry.  

According to the Ministry’s official report, “The Ministry’s Maritime Transport Committee reviewed footage covering the period of 12 hours before and 12 hours after the cables were cut, and no ships sailed the area. The area is also marked on maps as a no-go zone, and it is, therefore, ruled out that the damage to the cables was caused by shipping.”  

The fourth cable has reportedly been shut down due to power issues, which are expected to take several days to repair.  

With four cables now having been damaged in a week in the region, and particularly with the latest statement from the Ministry, speculation is running rampant as to whether the damage is a result of international sabotage. Reports claim a variety of sources that might have incapacitated the cables, from the U.S. Secret Service, to Islamic fundamentalists, or other military exercises. Others maintain the damage signifies retribution for the impending opening of the Iranian Oil Bourse, which will allow trading in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, potentially diminishing the value of the dollar.  

Clearly, the political impact, should the damage be attributed to military or financially motivated activity, poses severe implications, but apart from that, the mere impact on broadband connectivity within the region, and communications capabilities with Europe and North America have already been hampered, causing significant disruption to workflows at many businesses.  

“This has been an eye-opener for the telecom industry worldwide,” said According to Colonel R.S. Parihar, Secretary of the Internet Service Providers Association of India. “Today, the cause of the problem might have been an anchor, but what if it is sabotage tomorrow? These are owned by private operators, and there are no governments or armies protecting these cables.”  

Indeed, submarine cables carry nearly all global Internet and phone traffic — largely because it is considerably cheaper than satellite transmission — and further damage, or an inability to effectively repair the already disabled lines, could pose a significant impact on not only the global business community, which has come to rely heavily on IP-based communications.  

If the damage is, indeed, found to be accidental, the service disruptions, if nothing else, underscore the need for carrier network redundancies, which providers like VSNL have already taken to heart. VSNL was able to restore service to the majority of its Middle Eastern customers by virtue of its bi-directional backbone, which circles the globe, allowing eastward connectivity, should westward connections go down, as they did this past week.

**Authors:** Glenn O'Reilly, Joseph K. Kearney, John M. Lawler, Tom Looby

**Published Date:** 08/01/2017

**Content:**  
The objective of the paper is to develop a robust and reliable method to pinpoint submarine cable faults. Submarine cables have existed for over 100 years but there is still no single method used to determine the precise location of a submarine cable fault. The various methods used to pinpoint cable faults, both submarine and non-submarine were researched and investigated to produce a method which would accurately pinpoint submarine cable faults. From this, the idea of a hydrophone string was derived from a non-submarine pinpointing method currently used. The hydrophone string was tested and it accurately pinpointed the location of the cable fault.

**I. INTRODUCTION**  
Submarine cables have existed for over 100 years and throughout the years the role they play has varied. Historically, the main role of submarine cables was to supply power to lighthouses and isolated offshore facilities such as infirmary ships. Nowadays, submarine power cables have been developed for many more uses such as supplying power to islands and to neighbouring countries, the transfer of power from offshore renewable energy resources onto land and the supply of power to offshore facilities such as oil and gas rigs.

As countries strive to meet commitments under various agreements, such as the COP21 and EU2020 agreements, the importance of renewable energy resources increases. In many countries there is a heavy reliance on offshore-based renewable energy production to help meet these targets and because of this submarine power cables are seen as critical infrastructure.

Although submarine cables are designed to withstand the harsh conditions of the marine environment, they have a very high probability of at least one fault occurring during the cable lifetime. Faults are mostly caused by human activities or natural occurrences. Strong tides, landslides, hurricanes and earthquakes are the main effects of nature that cause cable faults, while human activities that cause faults include trawler fishing and ships laying anchors.

Faults in overhead lines are usually transient and self-restoring, and can be located quite easily and quickly. In comparison, submarine cable faults are much more complex; they are permanent faults and usually take a long time to repair. This puts a high priority on the time and accuracy of locating cable faults.

Locating the fault needs to be quick and accurate in order to restore power to homes and businesses, as well as keeping the cost of the repair as low as possible. Traditionally submarine cables would be hauled onto a barge or ship and the repair would be made there. However, as technology has advanced, there are a number of new methods, including the use of trained divers. Both methods are costly so completing the repair as quickly as possible is a necessity in keeping costs down.

**II. SUBMARINE CABLE FAULTS**  
Submarine cables have a high probability of at least one fault occurring during the life of the cable. In order to understand why there is such a high probability of a fault occurring, the different causes of submarine cable damage and the various types of faults will be investigated.

**A. Cause of Cable Damage**  
The majority of damage to submarine power cables is caused by human activities and natural disasters. Anchors and fishing equipment are the main human causes of damage to submarine cables. Natural disasters that damage submarine cables include strong tides, landslides, hurricanes and earthquakes. Fishing equipment is the most common cause of damage to submarine cables. Stow nets and pair trawling are two common fishing techniques that cause damage. The stow net technique involves large cone or pyramid shaped nets which are held using large anchors. These large anchors can cause damage to cables when they are dragged along the sea floor as well as the equipment fishermen use to recover lost fishing gear. The other technique that causes damage is pair trawling. This is one of the most popular methods of commercial fishing and involves two trawler boats travelling adjacent to each other with a net between the boats. The net has a heavy rope which weighs the net down and helps to keep the shape. Although this...","The article discusses submarine cables and their faults, directly addressing the topic of cut sea cables.

It explores the causes of cable damage, including human activities and natural disasters, and emphasizes the importance of accurately locating these faults to minimize repair costs and restore power.

This central theme aligns well with the criterion regarding cut sea cables."

Yet, late Friday, reports came in of a third cut cable (also a FLAG cable) in the Persian gulf, followed by Egyptian reports denying that the cuts were caused by ships, saying none were in the area. To top that off, on Sunday, reports came in of a fourth cable with problems in the Middle East (it’s unclear if this problem is as serious as a full cut cable), causing people to start thinking up conspiracy theories. It certainly is mighty strange to have four separate undersea cables with such problems in the same region within a few days of each other.

"Submarine Cables Cut After Taiwan Earthquake in December 2006","Eight submarine cables severed, disrupting internet services across Asia following the December 2006 earthquake.","https://www.submarinenetworks.com/news/cables-cut-after-taiwan-earthquake-2006","2023-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","Winston Qiu",Yes,"Winston Qiu","Hong Kong",-,"2023-02-06","English","SubmarineNetworks.com","On Tuesday December 26, 2006 at 12:25 UTC (20:25 local time), a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck off the southwest coast of Taiwan, approximately 22.8 km west southwest of Hengchun, Pingtung County, Taiwan. Eight submarine cables were cut after the earthquake and its aftershocks, catastrophically disrupting Internet services in Asia, affecting many Asian countries. Financial transactions, particularly in the foreign exchange market, were seriously affected as well. The 2006 Taiwan Earthquake rendered significant impacts on submarine networks.

Submarine Cables and Landing Stations in Taiwan
As of Dec 2006, there are 8 international submarine cables connecting Taiwan, including APCN, APCN-2, C2C, China-US CN, EAC, FLAG FEA, FNAL/RNAL, and SMW3, landing at Fangshan, Toucheng, Tanshui, and Pali cable landing stations.

Geographically, Taiwan locates in the circum-Pacific seismic belt, and the south and east coast of Taiwan are crowded with submarine cables, which makes the Taiwan coast a highly risk area in the submarine networks.

Cables Cut in the 2006 Hengchun, Taiwan earthquake
After the earthquake and its aftershocks, 8 submarine cable systems were cut, with 18 cable cuts:
- APCN, 2 cuts
- APCN-2, 2 cuts
- C2C, 3 cuts
- China-US CN, 3 cuts
- EAC, 3 cuts
- FLAG FEA, 1 cut
- FNAL/RNAL, 2 cuts
- SMW3, 2 cuts

Significant Impacts on Communications
As a result of the earthquake and multiple cable cuts, international communications over submarine networks were seriously disrupted, its impacts were immediately apparent and widely reported over the news media:
- Chunghwa Telecom, the largest operator in Taiwan, reported Internet outage of 100% to HK and South East Asia and 74% to Mainland China, though without impact to its northward traffic to Japan and the USA.
- PCCW, the largest operator in Hong Kong, reported more than 50% data capacity down.
- China Telecom and China Unicom, the top 2 Internet service providers in China, reported outage of more than 90% of traffic to the USA and Europe as most of their traffic going through Hong Kong and then northward to Japan and the USA. MSN, Hotmail, and Yahoo were completely disrupted.
- Singtel, KDDI etc. also reported serious impact.

The 2006 Taiwan Earthquake rendered on the telecommunications industry not just a disaster, but also had far more positive and significant impacts on the submarine networks and the industry:
- The importance of submarine networks to daily life and business worldwide was massively recognized.

As I was leaving to find my sleeping bag, several people insisted that sharing conspiracy theories about the three recent transcontinental fiber cuts was of greater importance than my own desire to sleep. Here goes…

It’s no secret that many governments tap undersea communications lines to install surveillance systems. One theory is that the cuts, initially reported as being caused by ships anchoring in rough seas, are actually a diversion to cover taps installed by a special submarine hundreds of miles away or by the repair ships themselves.

The USS Jimmy Carter is an example of a United States submarine equipped for this kind of mission, although other nations probably have this capability too. If such a submarine were doing this it seems unlikely that it would cause such massive interruptions. The whole point would be to do this covertly and so interruption would be momentary if it were noticed at all. More importantly, a tap is useless when the lines are out-of-service.

If the outages are intentional I suspect that there is something else going on.

(Updated: Feb-04 12:30 PST) I’ve edited this post and removed the ""lolsub"". These theories are getting more attention after Egypt retracted an earlier statement about this being caused by ships and a fourth cable had problems.

"Exploring Submarine Cables: The Internet's Undersea Infrastructure","99% of submarine cables are privately owned, with damage from fishing and shipping causing significant communication disruptions.","https://www.kentik.com/blog/diving-deep-into-submarine-cables-undersea-lifelines-of-internet-connectivity","","",Yes,"Phil Gervasi","San Francisco, CA, USA","1000","2023-03-28","English","Kentik","Under the waves at the bottom of the Earth’s oceans are almost 1.5 million kilometers of submarine fiber optic cables. Going unnoticed by most everyone in the world, these cables underpin the entire global internet and our modern information age. In this post, Phil Gervasi explains the technology, politics, environmental impact, and economics of submarine telecommunications cables.

Worldwide telecommunications began somewhere around 150 years ago, in 1850, with the first commercial international submarine cable between England and France. A few years later, by 1858, the first trans-Atlantic telegraph cable connected London with North America when 143 words were transmitted in about 10 hours.

Today, the United States’ financial and military command systems rely on global submarine cables. Trillions of dollars of daily transactions mean the entire global economy depends on submarine cables. Access to information for people around the world is dependent on submarine cables.

The infrastructure underpinning this incredible advancement in the transfer, availability, and access to information around the world is made almost entirely of submarine telecommunications cables running hundreds or thousands of meters below the waves on the ocean floor.

TeleGeograpy’s interactive map explores the world’s system of undersea fiber optic cables crossing oceans and following the coast of entire continents. And in a recent episode of Telemetry Now, Alan Mauldin, Research Director for TeleGeography, explained that the world of submarine cables is about politics, money, the environment, global commerce, and of course, moving data vast distances across a wire.

This post will explore some of these areas starting with the technology itself.

The submarine cables that move internet traffic around the world are made from silica glass fiber optic strands that most network engineers are likely familiar with. However, submarine cables need to allow light to travel very long distances with minimal attenuation, so the G.654 subset of fiber is used for undersea applications.

The cables make use of Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) to move large amounts of data by allowing different data streams in the form of multiple wavelengths of light to be sent simultaneously over a single fiber infrastructure. In the image below, notice how DWDM technology will take multiple data streams operating at different wavelengths and combine them for transport on a single optical fiber.

Submarine optical fibers are typically G.654A-D, meaning they are single mode and have better attenuation than most common land-based fiber optic cable types. G.654E fibers are in the same family of fibers but are typically used for more unique land-based applications requiring an even lower loss fiber.

Low attenuation, or low signal loss, is important since crossing oceans means light will be traveling considerable distances. G.654 compliant fibers have a zero-dispersion wavelength at about 1300nm and are optimized for use in the 1500 nm-1600 nm range. Attenuation is in the range of 0.15db/km-0.17db/km, which means there is very little loss over long distances. However, attenuation is not zero, so the signal does need to be repeated or amplified at prescribed points in the path of very long cables.

The amplifiers, sometimes called repeaters, are installed inline as part of the cable to restore the signal. These amplifiers are placed about every 70 km or so to enable the signal to travel vast distances while maintaining signal integrity.

Most submarine cables are powered with about 20k volts from both ends. Each power source powers half of the inline amplifiers. If power is lost from one end, the other power source can power the amplifiers throughout the cable until the power issue is resolved.

The image below is of a typical submarine cable amplifier, though they can vary in size.

A submarine cable is made up of several layers. Submarine cables are typically composed primarily of marine-grade polyethylene with steel strength members, copper conductors, and a glass fiber core.

At the core are the silicon glass optical fibers themselves, each of which is not much thicker than a human hair. Surrounding the fibers are various layers of protection and insulation.

The total thickness of a submarine cable without additional protective armor is only about that of a garden hose, approximately 20mm. The cable could be 50mm or more with the additional protective armor, depending on the application. The outermost armor layer protects the cable in the harsh environment at the bottom of the ocean.

Data transfer rates vary among the approximately 550 active cables running along the ocean floor. Because submarine cables are designed with a 25-year life expectancy in mind, some active cables are already two decades old and support a lower data transfer rate compared to one of the newer cables, the MAREA cable, laid in 2018 over 6,600km long, and with a transfer rate of 224Tbps.

When cables reach the end of their lifespan due to economic or technical reasons, they could be simply left unused on the ocean floor, repurposed in some way, or salvaged for raw materials.

There are approximately 1.4 million kilometers of active submarine cables in the world today. They vary in length from short spurs only a few kilometers long to long-distance cables such as the recently installed 2Africa cable at 45,000 km long. The 2Africa cable will connect 34 countries in three different contents and will be fully operational in 2024.

Some larger three-core power cables may also have some fiber strands to carry communication traffic. Still, dedicated communication submarine cables are generally much smaller, varying in size based on the amount of protective armor.

Cable landing stations

Ultimately, submarine cables lay on the ocean floor with terminations, or landings, on either end with the possibility for spurs along the path.

A cable landing station, or CLS, is chosen because the location typically has less marine traffic than much busier port cities. This piece of cable infrastructure is a critical component of the entire system as it serves as the point at which the cable makes landfall and transitions from under the water (wet) to land (dry).

The CLS is where the cable connects to land-based power and various networking provider infrastructure. A CLS could be a small, nondescript building in a small coastal town or part of a much larger data center. In either case, they are often secure facilities.

Since submarine (telecommunication) cables have a small footprint compared to much larger power cables and gas pipelines, their impact on the environment is minimal. In fact, when properly installed, a submarine cable will actually serve as a new marine ecosystem substrate within just a few months of installation. The area around certain sections of cables is dedicated cable protection zones which often also turn into marine wildlife sanctuaries as a side-effect.

Notice the cable in the image below encrusted with marine organisms.

Cable faults rarely occur due to marine life, such as shark bites or whale entanglements. The last reported incident of a submarine communication cable being damaged by a marine organism was from the mid-1980s when a damaged cable was recovered near the Canary Islands with shark bite marks on the cable itself.

As a result, cable armor has improved, and laying techniques have changed such that there is no evidence at all of any damage to a submarine cable due to any type of marine organism (including sharks) since then.

However, the environment does affect submarine cables in other ways. The ocean floor is inherently a harsh environment, and the naturally occurring activity at great depths, sometimes thousands of meters deep, can adversely affect the integrity of the cable structure.

Undersea current abrasion, weather events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes, and other natural phenomena have played a role in damaged cables over the years. But these events are very few and account for only around 10% of cable faults.

Fishing, trawling, and shipping activity all play a much more significant role in causing cable faults today. Despite cable protection zones being identified on nautical charts, the most common cause for cable damage is a ship anchor or fishing equipment coming in contact with a cable in shallower depths of less than 200m.

However, commercial fishing and ship anchors still routinely damage submarine cables in shallower depths despite these designated areas. Trawling gear or anchors getting tangled with cables is one of the main causes of a cable fault not because it completely severs the cable but because it can damage the armor layer and sheathing, protecting the fibers deep inside the cable structure. When this happens, salt water can enter the cable and disrupt communication activity.

Repair of damaged cables means sending a repair ship to the location of the problem, splicing the cable, repairing it, and re-attaching the ends.

In shallow waters, this can be done by divers, but in deeper waters, this requires capturing the cable and hoisting it up to a ship to repair it.

Damaged cables can result in a loss of capacity, increased latency, or in the worst case, a halt of all communication activity.","The article extensively discusses submarine cables, including their construction, operation, and the implications of cable damage.

It specifically mentions the causes of cable faults, primarily due to fishing and shipping activities, and explains how damaged cables can lead to loss of capacity and communication disruptions.

International underwater fiber optic cable systems currently dwarf Vietnam’s international connection output over land and by satellite.

**The AAG – ‘the backbone’**

Before 2009, Vietnam was completely reliant on its connection via two underwater Internet cable systems, namely the SMW3 (Southeast Asia - Middle East - Western Europe 3) and the TVH (Thailand-Vietnam-Hong Kong), both of which had limited capacity.

The Asia-America Gateway (AAG) officially came into operation in November 2009 and quickly proved crucial to the country’s connectivity.

The AAG is a 20,000-kilometer submarine communication cable, connecting Southeast Asia with the U.S. mainland across the Pacific Ocean via Guam and Hawaii.

The AAG was designed with an initial capacity of 2Tbps (2,000Gbps) but has undergone multiple upgrades since.

Nguyen Huu Khanh, then-director of Vietnam Telecom International (VTI), said that the AAG launch was expected to meet the demands of Vietnamese users for bandwidth.

Subsequently, the TVH system was slated for ‘retirement’ in late 2009. Also in November 2009, the Intra-Asia (IA) cable was put into operation with an initial total capacity of 320Gbps.

In late 2016, the Asia Pacific Gateway (APG) was completed, allowing for the highest Internet traffic capacity in Asia.

**Repeated ruptures**

Internet traffic in Vietnam is heavily impacted whenever the AAG cable ruptures, as it has the largest capacity of the three current systems. Since becoming operational in November 2009, the AAG has experienced repeated problems.

Experts maintain that the East Vietnam Sea and Singaporean waters invariably experience hectic shipping activity, which can lead to issues. In case of ruptures, the control station in the affected area will locate the breakage and inform the system operators. The average total timeframe for repair is between three and four weeks.

**Why optic fiber cables?**

The latest addition to Vietnam’s network of international submarine optic fiber cables is the AAE-1 (Asia - Africa - Europe). Submarine optic fiber cables are the telecom cables laid on the seafloor which have glass or plastic core and make use of light to transmit data. An average undersea optical fiber cable is 69mm in diameter and weighs an average of 10kg/m.","The article titled 'The Internet turns 20 in Vietnam: P7 – Fiber optic cable ‘gateways’' discusses submarine fiber optic cables, particularly the Asia-America Gateway (AAG), and details the significant impact of cable ruptures on internet connectivity in Vietnam.

It explicitly mentions repeated problems with the AAG since its operation began in 2009, indicating that these interruptions are common and have various causes, including marine traffic and weather conditions.

The article also describes the repair process for ruptured cables, detailing the steps involved and the timeframes required for repairs.

Undersea cables are hidden but increasingly vital enablers of the global economy. Everyday business activities rely on these cables.

Recent sabotage attempts on cables in the Red Sea and the Nord Stream gas pipeline explosion in Europe in 2022 are examples of an emerging geopolitical threat.

### Threats to undersea infrastructure

Three key potential threat sources: accidental damage, natural hazards, and sabotage/cyber-attack.

#### Accidental damage

More than 70% of cable faults stem from unintentional damage.

#### Natural hazards

Underwater infrastructure can be exposed to natural disasters such as tsunamis and storms.

#### Sabotage and cyber-attack

Underwater cables are relatively easy to locate, making them vulnerable to sabotage.

### The financial impact of damage to cable networks

**Ninety-nine percent of the world's digital communications rely on subsea cables. When they break, it could spell disaster for a whole country's internet. How do you fix a fault at the bottom of the ocean?**  
  
It was a little after 17:00 on 18 November 1929 when the ground began to shake. Just off the coast of Burin Peninsula, a finger-like protrusion on the south of Newfoundland, Canada, a 7.2 magnitude earthquake disturbed the evening's peace. Residents noticed only a little damage at first – a few toppled chimney pots.  
  
But out at sea, an unseen force was moving. By around 19:30, a 13m-high (43ft) tsunami made landfall on the Burin Peninsula. In total, 28 people lost their lives as a result of drowning or injuries caused by the wave.  
  
The earthquake was devastating for the local communities, but it also had a long-lasting effect further out at sea. It had triggered a submarine landslide. People did not realise this at the time, historical records suggest, because no one knew such underwater landslides existed. When sediment is disturbed by earthquakes and other geological activity it makes the water denser, causing it to flow downwards like an avalanche of snow down a mountain. The submarine landslide – called a turbidity current – flowed more than 1,000km (621 miles) away from the earthquake's epicentre on the Laurentian Continental Slope at speeds between 50 and 70 knots (57-80mph).  
  
Although the landslide was not noticed at the time, it left a tell-tale clue. In its way lay the latest in communication technology at the time: transatlantic subsea cables. And those cables broke. Twelve of them were snapped in a total of 28 places. Some of the 28 breaks happened almost synchronously with the earthquake. But the other 16 breaks happened over a much longer period, as the cables snapped one after the other in a kind of mysterious ripple pattern, from 59 minutes after the earthquake to 13 hours and 17 minutes later, and over 500km (311 miles) away from the epicentre.  
  
If they'd all been snapped by the quake itself, the cables would have all broken at the same time – so scientists began to wonder, why didn't they? Why did they break one after the other?  
  
It wasn't until 1952 that researchers pieced together why the cables broke in sequence, over such a large area, and at intervals that seemed to slow with distance from the epicentre. They figured out that a landslide smashed through them – the snapping cables traced its movement across the seafloor. Until that point, no one knew of the existence of turbidity currents. Because these cables broke, and because there was a record of the time they broke, they helped in the understanding of ocean movements above and below the surface. They caused a complex repair job, but also became accidental scientific instruments, recording a fascinating natural phenomenon far out of human sight.  
  
Over the following decades, as the global web of deep-sea cables expanded, their repair and maintenance resulted in other surprising scientific discoveries – opening up entirely new worlds and allowing us to spy on the seabed like never before, while also allowing us to communicate at record speed. At the same time, our daily lives, incomes, health and safety have also become more and more dependent on the internet – and ultimately, this complex network of undersea cables. So what happens when they break?  
  
Submarine cables form a global web at the bottom of the sea, keeping us all connected.  
  
There are 1.4 million km (870,000 miles) of telecommunication cables on the seafloor, covering every ocean on the planet. Laid end to end, these cables would span the diameter of the Sun, and are responsible for the transfer of 99% of all digital data. But for something so important, they are surprisingly slender – often little more than 2cm in diameter, or about the width of a hosepipe.  
  
A repeat of the 1929 mass cable outage would have significant impacts on communication between North America and Europe. However, ""for the most part, the global network is remarkably resilient,"" says Mike Clare, the International Cable Protection Committee's marine environmental advisor who researches the impacts of extreme events on submarine systems. ""There are 150 to 200 instances of damage to the global network each year. So if we look at that against 1.4 million km, that's not very many, and for the most part, when this damage happens, it can be repaired relatively quickly.""  
  
How does the internet run on such slim cables and avoid disastrous outages?  
  
Since the first cables were laid in the 19th Century, they have been exposed to extreme environmental events, from submarine volcanic eruption to typhoons and floods. But the biggest cause of damage is not natural.  
  
Most faults, with figures varying 70-80% depending on where you are in the world, relate to accidental human activities like the dropping of anchors or dragging of trawler boat nets, which snag on the cables. These usually occur in depths of 200-300m (but commercial fishing is increasingly pushing into deeper waters – in some places, 1,500m in the Northeast Atlantic). Only 10-20% of faults worldwide relate to natural hazards, and more frequently relate to cables wearing thin in places where currents cause them to rub against rocks, causing what are called ""shunt faults"".  
  
(The idea that cables break because sharks bite through them is now a bit of an urban legend, adds Clare. ""There were instances of sharks damaging cables, but that's long gone because the cable industry uses a layer of Kevlar to strengthen them."")  
  
Cables have to be kept thin and light in deeper waters, though, to aid with recovery and repair. Hauling a large, heavy cable up from thousands of metres below sea level would put a huge amount of strain on it. It's the cables nearer the shoreline that tend to be better armoured because they are more likely to be snagged by nets and anchors.  
  
If a fault is found, a repair ship is dispatched. ""All these vessels are strategically placed around the world to be 10-12 days from base to port,"" says Mick McGovern, deputy vice-president for marine operations at Alcatel Submarine Networks. ""You have that time to work out where the fault is, load the cables [and the] repeater bodies – which increase the strength of a signal as it travels along the cables. ""In essence when you think how big the system is, it's not long to wait,"" he says.  
  
While it took nine months to repair the last of the subsea cable damage caused by the 1929 Newfoundland earthquake, McGovern says a modern deep-water repair should take a week or two depending on the location and the weather. ""When you think about the water depth and where it is, that's not a bad solution.""  
  
That does not mean an entire country's internet is then down for a week. Many nations have more cables and more bandwidth within those cables than the minimum required amount, so that if some are damaged, the others can pick up the slack. This is called redundancy in the system. Because of this redundancy, most of us would never notice if one subsea cable was damaged – perhaps this article would take a second or two longer to load than normal. In extreme events, it can be the only thing keeping a country online.  
  
To repair the damage, the ship deploys a grapnel, or grappling hook, to lift and snip the cable, pulling one loose end up to the surface and reeling it in across the bow with large, motorised drums. The damaged section is then winched into an internal room and analysed for a fault, repaired, tested by sending a signal back to land from the boat, sealed and then attached to a buoy while the process is repeated on the other end of the cable.  
  
Once both ends are fixed, each optical fibre is spliced together under microscope to make sure that there is good connection, and then they are sealed together with a universal joint that is compatible with any manufacturer's cable, making life easier for international repair teams, McGovern says.  
  
Deep-sea cables can double as scientific instruments, giving us insights into life in the ocean.  
  
The repaired cables are lowered back into the water, and in some cases, they can continue to provide data about the ocean’s conditions, contributing to scientific research and monitoring.","The article titled ""The deep-sea 'emergency service' that keeps the internet running"" discusses the importance of undersea cables in global communications.

It mentions that ""Ninety-nine percent of the world's digital communications rely on subsea cables"" and provides a historical account of the 1929 earthquake that caused significant cable damage, noting that it ""snapped twelve cables in a total of 28 places."" Furthermore, the article states that there are ""150 to 200 instances of damage to the global network each year,"" primarily due to human activities.

The tanker is believed to have damaged submarine telecoms and electricity cables by dragging its anchor across the lines late last year.  

Late last month a series of subsea cables between Finland and Estonia were severed, causing significant disruption to data transport between both countries. An adjacent subsea power cable was also damaged.  

An investigation into the damage was quickly launched, Finnish authorities seizing the tanker Eagle S, which was in the vicinity when the damage occurred.  

Speaking the following day, Helsinki’s Police Chief Jari Liukku said Finnish authorities were “investigating grave sabotage”, with authorities further alleging that Eagle S is part of a so-called ‘shadow fleet’ of older tankers seeking to evade sanctions on the sale of Russian oil.  

On Friday, the ship’s owner, United Arab Emirates-based Caravella LLC FZ, had its request to release the ship denied by a Finnish court.  

Repairs to the cable system are expected to take two months.  

The Baltic has turned into a hotspot for subsea cable damage since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Late last year, a pair of submarine cables in the region were damaged in what is being investigated as an act of sabotage as part of Russia’s ‘hybrid warfare’ strategy to destabilise the region.  

In response, NATO has said it will boost its presence in the region to protect the critical infrastructure.  

The Baltic is not the only region seeing a worrisome increase in submarine cable damage in recent years. The Red Sea, for example, saw significant cable damage last year linked to Houthi rebels in Yemen attacking shipping routes.  

The geopolitically charged waters around Taiwan have also seen increased cable disruption. Today, a submarine cable in the region was cut off the north-east coast of the island, with authorities blaming a Cameroonian-registered cargo ship, the Shunxin-39, for causing accidental damage.

“SEA-ME-WE3 Cable between Perth and Singapore is currently down,” Vocus Communications told customers in a status update early on 3 December. “Customers can expect to see increased latency to Asian destinations until this link is restored.

“Our provider has advised that the location of the fault is approximately 1126km from the cable landing station in Singapore,” it said, adding that there is currently no estimate as to when the cable break might be fixed.

It was in late August that wild weather in parts of South East Asia, including Typhoon Hato and Severe Tropical Storm Pakhar, last knocked out the part of the undersea cable lying between Perth and Singapore. It wasn’t until October that services were back up.

While Vocus has warned its customers to expect some latency to Asian destinations, it is also using the latest cable break to talk up the construction of its Australia Singapore Cable (ASC) part of which will be laid in a shallow trench and buried specifically to avoid the type of breaks that have hit the existing SEA-ME-WE3 cable.

Specifically, the new cable will be buried up to four metres below the seabed between Singapore and Christmas Island using a 40-tonne plough. This is largely because the ASC travels through the Java Sea, which is shallow and highly trafficked.

“The SMW3 system is nearing end-of-life”, head of Vocus International, Luke Mackinnon, said. “It is a fragile system and as outages like this -- the third this year -- show, Australia requires more robust alternatives and more capacity to South-East Asia.”

In late November, it was revealed that Metronode’s Shenton Park data centre facility in Perth would be the landing station for Vocus Communications’ US$170 million ASC cable.

Vocus said on 28 November that building work on the new cable, which is being built in partnership with Alcatel Submarine Networks (ASN), had passed its halfway point as the manufacturing work nears completion.","The article discusses the severing of the SEA-ME-WE3 subsea telecommunications cable between Perth and Singapore, detailing its impact on internet latency for Australian users.

It became inoperable due to a “shunt fault” approximately 1,886 kilometers from Alexandria towards Palermo, Italy in the S4 section of the cable.

A shunt fault occurs when the submarine cable insulation becomes damaged and a short circuit occurs when it comes into contact with water. While repairs are underway it is likely that the outage will take a further 4 days at a minimum and might take up to 10 days depending on weather and sea conditions.

Until today, SEA-ME-WE-4 was operating with limited capacity, however, today starting 12 PM Pakistan Time, all west bound traffic from Egypt onwards has been shut down.

Meaning that all traffic to Europe and US (from Pakistan) may face higher latency – but not the blackout due to redundant/alternate pipes available for usage. Though they cost extra to service providers because of shift of all traffic load to secondary pipes.

In a telephonic communication a Transworld official told ProPakistani that Transworld has bought additional capacity, worth millions of dollars, for eastbound routes, initially landing at Singapore via Japan to United States and then to Europe.

This will increase the route distance hence the latency, but traffic will not be impacted at large, said the official.

Transworld and PTCL are only operators selling international voice and data traffic in Pakistan.

Transworld, that is a sister concern of Mobilink and a project of Orascom has 40 percent market share in Pakistan for International traffic, with major operators such as Wateen, Worldcall, wi-tribe, Neyatel etc on its network.","The article titled ""SEA-ME-WE-4 Outage to Affect Internet and Telcom Traffic"" discusses the recent cutting of the SEA-ME-WE 4 submarine cable, providing details about the location of the cut and its implications for internet traffic.

*By Chen Yu-fu / Staff reporter*  

Sea vessels from neighboring countries have repeatedly damaged submarine cables connecting Taiwan proper with outlying islands, a budget review report published by the National Audit Office showed.  

Communication between Taiwan proper and outlying islands depends mainly on underwater cable communication systems, supplemented by microwave transmission and satellite systems, the report says.  

Once underwater cable system malfunctions, it can severely affect communication among Taiwan proper, Penghu, Kinmen and Lienchiang (Matsu) counties, it says.  

A cable-laying ship connects an underwater Internet cable to a landing point in an undated photograph.  

The nation has 10 domestic submarine cables, all invested, constructed and maintained by Chunghwa Telecom, the report says.  

There were 36 cases of damage caused by external forces from 2019 to last year, with an average of about seven submarine cable failures per year, it says.  

Twelve submarine cable failures were recorded last year alone, the most in the past five years, the report says.  

“It is reported the damage was mainly caused by the operation or anchoring of various vessels, such as sand dredgers, fishing boats and merchant ships from neighboring countries. Repairs can sometimes take more than four months to complete, which greatly affects the lives of people on the outlying islands,” it says.  

Among the damaged cables is the No. 2 undersea telecom cable connecting New Taipei City’s Tamsui District (淡水) and Lienchiang County’s Dongyin Island (東引), which was suspected of being damaged by a fishing boat anchoring on Feb. 2 last year, it says.  

Another cable, connecting Caota (草漯) in Taoyuan and Lienchiang County’s Nangan Island (南竿), the No. 3 cable, was suspected of being damaged by a cargo ship on Feb. 8, resulting in the congestion of mobile communications and Internet services for more than 10,000 households in Matsu, it says.  

The incident seriously affected the operations of government agencies, financial transactions, medical services and transportation, it says.  

“The National Communications Commission says it has asked telecoms to reduce the risk of submarine cable damage through multiple protection mechanisms, including conducting telecom traffic diversion drills and replacing submarine cables in sections with higher failure rates. The capacity of the microwave backup system would continue to be expanded as well,” the report says.","The article discusses the frequent damage to submarine cables connecting Taiwan to its outlying islands, highlighting specific incidents, their causes, and the resulting impacts on communication.

Bangladesh has suffered major Internet cable damage, with an undersea cable being accidentally cut. The SEA-ME-WE 4 cable is a major source of Internet access to India, Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore, and the only submarine connection to Bangladesh. Businesses have been suffering extremely slow connections which has severely affected their operations, especially those involved in outsourcing and teleworking.

Ultra-high speed undersea cables form the Internet backbone which transfers data between countries and continents. Often almost all Internet communications for an entire country are routed through just a handful of cables, meaning damage to one causes significant problems.

In January 2008 millions of Internet users in the Middle East and Asia lost Internet access after a backbone cable off the coast of Italy was cut by a ship. The lack of access severely restricted many businesses in an area of the world known for its growing hi-tech industries.

Further damage to subsea cables in the Red Sea has the potential to cause major disruption to network connectivity.

We doubt the Houthis were behind recently-reported damage to underwater cables in the Red Sea. A telecoms provider reported damage to a few sea cables that it manages off the coast of Yemen on 24 February. And international and regional media outlets have subsequently said that the Houthis are the possible perpetrator. The group has denied it, which is unusual. It usually claims its attacks directly. We also understand that dredging or anchor drifting are other plausible causes. While the recent incidents did not appear to result in widespread network disruption, damage to cables in the Red Sea region have previously done so.

### Implications for internet connectivity

Damage to subsea cables in the Red Sea has the potential to result in major disruption to network connectivity. That is particularly in parts of East Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The EU has previously described the Red Sea as one of the ‘bottlenecks’ for the bloc’s connectivity with Asia; 16 intercontinental cables reportedly run through it. Cybersecurity firms noted that the cutting of two cables in the region (one where it passes overland in Egypt) in 2022 affected internet connectivity for millions of users for several hours in Africa and the Middle East, particularly in Ethiopia.

The recent incidents did not appear to result in wide-ranging disruption to internet services. Cloudflare Radar, which monitors internet traffic trends, said on 27 February that it did ‘[not] observe any clear changes in internet traffic or latency in potentially affected areas…including Djibouti, Egypt, Kenya and Tanzania’. A cable operator reportedly confirmed outages to its services from Kenya to Egypt starting on 24 February, but said internet traffic was rerouted through alternative paths. The internet connectivity tracker NetBlocks did report on network disruptions in Djibouti between 24-26 February, though.

### Analysis of potential causes

It is unclear what was the origin of the damage. The company that manages the cables said that it has begun an investigation. It would appear within the general means of the Houthis to damage the cables. The US on 18 February stated that they have struck an unmanned underwater vessel in Houthi-controlled areas. And waters in the Red Sea, especially around Bab Al-Mandeb, appear to be shallow enough (50-150m) to allow professional divers to cut the cables. But based on a recent EU report on sea cables security, anchor drifting or dredging can also potentially harm the cables.

We are not convinced by a recent flurry of news over the past few days speculating that this was a Houthi attack. Those reports have come from Israeli-based media outlets as well as the international press. This follows regional media outlets reporting in December 2023 and February this year that the group ‘may sabotage Western internet cables’. But these reports cite online accounts that are only allegedly linked to the Houthis, based on our monitoring of those channels.

### Houthis do not seem intent on attacking cables

The Houthi do not seem to want to target sea cables. The rebel group has publicly denied these and previous allegations; the Sanaa-based ministry of telecommunications on 27 February said it would ‘keep all submarine cables and its relevant services away from any possible risks’. There seems to be little the group has to gain from hiding responsibility it might have. On the contrary; the Houthis have openly claimed recent attacks on commercial shipping. The group launched at least 62 attacks against a wide range of commercial vessels since October, including Norwegian, Hong Kong and Panama owned.","The article titled 'Red Sea | Assessment of subsea cable damage' discusses the damage to subsea cables in the Red Sea, particularly mentioning a telecom provider's report of damage to cables off the coast of Yemen.

It states that 'damage to subsea cables in the Red Sea has the potential to result in major disruption to network connectivity,' highlighting the implications for internet connectivity in East Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.

Furthermore, it explores the potential causes of the damage, including the possibility of intentional acts versus natural causes like anchor drifting or dredging.

An Attack on a Spam Tracking Company and Cut Internet Cord Slows Down Speeds**  
March 29, 2013 &#151; -- ""The Internet almost broke."" ""The Internet slowed down."" ""Internet cable cut.""

Those are just a few of the statements bandied about by organizations and in the media after two separate, unrelated events this week: First, there was one of the worst cyberattacks ever on the Internet; second, an underseas cable off the coast of Egypt was cut. The two attacks have affected Internet speeds and stability.

**Spamhaus and Cyberbunker Denial of Service Attacks**  
It's been called the biggest denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in history and one of the fiercest cyberfights. So who was fighting and how did it happen?

At the center of it all are two companies – Spamhaus and Cyberbunker.

The Geneva-based Cyberbunker, which is based out of a former NATO bunker, is a hosting service, or a company that hosts websites and services on its servers. But it's not just a normal hosting company – this one will host any type of website. The only things it refuses to host or save is child pornography and terrorist sites. Sites with malware or other dangerous viruses, which can attack your computers, are free game. Cyberbunker also allows the sites that use the service to stay completely anonymous.

But when Spamhaus, a company that works to block spam, added the company to its list of suspected spam-hosting websites, Cyberbunker was far from happy. So it launched a massive denial of service attack (DDoS) at Spamhaus. A DDoS attack is a cyberattack that aims to make a service unusable.

""Imagine someone knocking on the door and you have to say, Hello, who is it?"" Tom Galvin, executive director of Digital Citizens Alliance, explained to ABC News. ""Now imagine that is happening every single second,"" he added, referring to the traffic Spamhaus had to respond to. ""What else are you getting done? It requires the network to verify who else is on the other side of the door and it locks the system up."" Continuing the traffic analogy, it was as if lots of cars were trying to get through on a road that is blocked off.

**Internet Slow Down?**  
In the case of Spamhaus, the attack was so large and so much data was being fired at the company that the congestion caused Internet speed disruptions. CloudFare, the company that helped Spamhaus fight the attack, said that at one point 300Gbps of attack traffic was being sent, which would make this one of the largest attacks ever reported.

""You can only force so much data and packets of information through a connection,"" Adam Wosotowsky, messaging data architect at McAfee Labs, explained to ABC News. ""When that packet is going across, it has to get to the other side cleanly, if you have contention issues and a lot of extraneous data, those packets start to collide and the network isn't as clean. It gets clogged.""

As a result of the unprecedented attack, there were service slowdowns for ordinary Internet users, and McAfee and other security companies have confirmed that some sites were affected with slow load times. CloudFare said it caused disruptions to London and Hong Kong's backend Internet systems. Netflix was said to be one of the services that was impacted by the slow load times, though Netflix has declined to comment and it hasn't been confirmed. Typically DDoS attacks, which occur all the time, don't have such far-reaching impact.

Madory didn't minimize the repurcussions of the Cyberbunker-Spamhaus spat, but he did say that another event this week could have had even bigger or more widespread implications.

""One of the biggest cables that connects Europe to the biggest cables was cut, that's a way to create a widespread impact,"" Madory said. [According to the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21963100), three scuba divers were caught trying to cut an undersea Internet cable off Egypt. The damaged cable caused service disruptions in Egypt, Africa and other parts of the Middle East. The motive of the men is unknown. Problems in Internet service in Egypt is not new: Two years ago, during the [Arab Spring uprising](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/embassy-attacks-put-critical-focus-obamas-arab-spring/story?id=17232430), Internet access in Egypt was cut off.

Other outages in the region were thought to be attributed to additional underseas cable disruption, likely caused by a boat or an anchor. Madory and Wosotowsky both said that there are other cable links to provide connectivity to the countries, but that it can have a significant effect on speeds and stability of the service.

""It's one thing with a DDoS attack, we are able to push that away with code, but when you cut a wire you have to get out there and splice that thing back together and get it up and running,"" Wosotowsky said. ""Hardware attacks are much more expensive and take a lot more time to recover from.""

**The Digital Mafia**  
The two attacks, while not related, do demonstrate that it's not just the individuals on the Internet, but the Internet itself, which stands in harm's way with the rise of cyberattacks.

""Bad guys are always going to be on the look for the weakness in the chain, that's why these things take place. It will either be a DDoS or cables being cut,"" Galvin said. ""It's the same way 50 or 40 years ago we made an effort to crackdown on the Mafia. We need to have the same focus on the criminals on the Internet today.","The article titled ""Is the Internet O.K.?

The 10 000km Eassy cable, which stretches from Sudan to SA, suffered a cut on 17 February between Djibouti and Port Sudan, says Chris Wood, CEO of West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC), which has an almost 30% stake in the network.

Wood says the rest of the cable is still functioning because its “collapsed loop network configuration” allows for the internal re-routing of traffic when a break occurs. The WIOCC chief executive also says the fault on Eassy did not have “much impact” on its customers either, as the vast majority of its data traffic exits Africa through Djibouti.

However, it was not only the Eassy cable that was sliced. The SMW3 and EIG networks, used by Eassy to carry traffic from Africa to Europe, were damaged just north of Djibouti in what appears to have been part of a single incident.

“It is believed that a cargo ship dragged its anchor over a distance of some 150km in the Red Sea, cutting all three cables one after the other,” notes Wood.

“Most Eassy owners also own capacity on other systems and have in-built redundancy in their networks. As such, most of the Africa to Europe traffic affected by the cuts to SMW3 and EIG has already been re-routed onto other systems, both in Djibouti and via South Africa,” Wood adds.

WIOCC says the SMW3 cable could be repaired by 12 March, a fix that could restore most of the affected traffic on its direct path to Europe. The company also says the EIG cable could be repaired by the same date as the Eassy cable, 20 March.

### Piracy threat?

The damage to all three cables, though, occurred in and around the area of the Red Sea, which has experienced problems of piracy - a factor that could potentially delay repair times, according to experts.

“It's a very dangerous spot to ever park a ship,” says JP Viljoen, a systems engineer at Neology, a wholesale bandwidth provider to ISPs in Africa.

The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Commercial Crime Services said on 15 February it received information that in the Bab El Mandeb Straits of the Red Sea “seven pirates in two skiffs... chased a chemical tanker”. The ICC Commercial Crime Services also said that in the same area of the Red Sea, on 27 February, the crew of a bulk carrier in the strait reported sightings of nine skiffs approaching their boat aggressively.

On both occasions, the alleged pirates aborted their attacks, according to the reports.

But Mike Last, director for marketing and international business development at WIOCC, says: “I don't think piracy is an issue with this.”

He notes that the time-scale of the planned repair is dependent on issues such as securing permits, sailing time and weather conditions. He says a ship from the Middle East is going to be sent to fix the cable. He did not specify when that ship would be sent exactly.

### Destructive anchors

Meanwhile, reports have emerged in the last few days that The East African Marine System (TEAMS) 5 000km undersea fibre-optic cable, stretching from Kenya to the United Arab Emirates, was also cut by a ship's anchor in the Kenyan port of Mombasa.

The disruption caused a 20% slowdown in Internet speeds in Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, Ethiopia and South Sudan, the BBC reported.

Wood says the Eassy cable is functioning normally from Mombasa.

He adds that some TEAMS owners are in the process of re-routing their traffic onto the Eassy system in Mombasa, to reduce the impact in Kenya and other countries in East Africa while the repair to TEAMS is undertaken.","The article titled 'Ship slices three undersea cables' directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables, mentioning specific incidents involving the Eassy, SMW3, and EIG cables.

It is extremely unlikely, although not impossible, that saboteurs were responsible for the cut in Seacom and other undersea cables north of Egypt last Friday, Seacom CEO Mark Simpson says.

Simpson’s comments come after news on Thursday morning that Egyptian authorities had arrested three divers off the coast of Alexandria suspected of trying to sever the Sea-Me-We 4 cable system that runs through the region.

According to reports by international news wires, Egyptian naval forces, which made the arrests, have not furnished the alleged saboteurs’ motives for wanting to the cut Sea-Me-We 4. The cable is a crucial link between Europe, the Middle East and Asia.

Simpson tells TechCentral that the divers were arrested just hundreds of metres from the Egyptian shoreline, where the cable was fairly easily accessible.

Last week’s break to the Seacom cable, on the other hand, occurred nearly 20km from the shore in much deeper water. Simpson says the cable break also had all of the characteristics of a having been cut by a ship’s anchor being dragged along the sea bed, making it more unlikely the cut was due to sabotage.

“You can never say never, but I’d be very surprised [if it was sabotage],” Simpson says.

The Seacom CEO said earlier this week that “external aggression” caused by ships dragging their anchors “remains a common cause of damage to cable systems globally, despite our continued efforts to protect the cable with armour, burying, notifications to ships of cable locations, and exclusion zones.” — _(c) 2013 NewsCentral Media_","The article titled ""Sabotage not suspected in Seacom cut: CEO"" discusses the cutting of undersea cables, specifically the Seacom cable and the Sea-Me-We 4 cable.

He did not give details of the divers' possible motive in severing the link he said belonged to Egypt Telecom, the country's monopoly landline provider.

“The armed forces foiled an attempt and arrested three divers while they were cutting a submarine cable,” he said.

It was not immediately clear whether the incident was related to disruptions off Egypt reported by cable operator SEACOM last week that it said hit several lines connecting Europe with Africa, the Middle East and Asia.

SEACOM did not give any explanation for the cuts it said hit its cables and other network systems funnelling telecoms traffic backwards and forwards in the early hours of Friday.

Web users have reported slower connections across Egypt since then.

The firm, which carries traffic for other companies, said on Wednesday services had been restored only to report hours later another connection had been cut.

The telecoms infrastructure snaking under the Mediterranean has suffered several disruptions in recent years. In the past, some operators and users have suggested cables had been caught in the propellers of passing ships.

Egypt Telecom said one of its cables had been cut 750m off the coast, according to a separate report on state news agency MENA on Wednesday. Services would be restored by Wednesday night, it added.

"Undersea Cables: Vulnerabilities and Global Impact","Explores targeted incidents affecting undersea cables, crucial for global communications, with significant implications for security and connectivity.","https://www.govtech.com/network/undersea-cables-too-valuable-to-leave-vulnerable.html","2017-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","December 12, 2017 • Tim Johnson McClatchy, Washington Bureau",Yes,"Tim Johnson","Folsom, California, USA","5000","2017-12-12","English","Government Technology","(TNS) WASHINGTON — Hundreds of thousands of miles of fiber-optic cable lay on the ocean floors, a crucial part of the global internet’s backbone, and only rarely do ship anchors, undersea landslides or saboteurs disrupt them.

Still, a few voices now call for stronger global mechanisms and even military action to protect the cables against future malicious activity by states, saboteurs or extremists.

“The infrastructure that underpins the internet — these undersea cables — are clearly vulnerable,” said Rishi Sunak, a British member of Parliament and champion of more vigorous action to protect submarine networks. “They underpin pretty much everything that we do.”

Undersea cables conduct nearly 97 percent of all global communications, and every day an estimated $10 trillion in financial transfers and vast amounts of data pass through the seabed routes. Satellites, once crucial but now limited in speed and bandwidth, handle only a tiny percentage of global communications.

As reliance on the underwater cables soars, a growing list of countries — and even companies — have the expertise to deploy unmanned vehicles to ocean depths to access them.

“Nowadays, there are a lot of countries and companies that have the ability to send vehicles down to the sea floor and have them manipulate, install or take away undersea cables,” said Bryan Clark, a retired naval submariner and former Navy strategist who is a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington think tank.

The optical strands inside the cables have extraordinary capacity to transmit data, millions of phone calls per fiber. The cables that house bundled fiber optics are no thicker than a human wrist.

Failures along cable routes are rare, numbering on average barely 200 a year along the estimated 650,000 miles of active international commercial cables laid along sea beds.

“It’s still vanishingly small when the amount of cable around the globe is considered,” said Keith Schofield, general manager of the International Cable Protection Committee, which has its headquarters in Lymington, England.

There are 428 known commercial fiber-optic cable routes worldwide. Many cables are laid parallel along heavily trafficked routes, like the U.S. to Britain, or through the Mediterranean and Red Sea toward India and the rest of Asia, and come ashore together. Florida has about 10 landing points for the two dozen or so cables that come ashore there.

Most problems occur close to landfall, not in the open ocean, and the majority involve nets from trawlers or damage by anchors, Schofield said.

But in recent years, a few incidents have drawn attention to sabotage and espionage.

In October 2015, U.S. authorities scrambled to monitor Russian submarine patrols and a high-tech Russian surface ship, the Yantar, in a corridor of the North Atlantic that hosts a cluster of undersea cables. The Yantar carried deep-sea submersibles and cable-cutting gear.

In an earlier incident, Egypt said in March 2013 that it had arrested three scuba divers who had tried to cut an undersea fiber optic cable in the Mediterranean off Alexandria that was a vital communications link between Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Egypt never explained who the three saboteurs worked for.

At one time, only the United States and the Soviet Union, now Russia, deployed submarines able to reach deep depths to manipulate fiber-optic cables. But deep-sea remotely powered vehicles are now widely available, putting the technology in more hands.

“All you need to do is give them a claw and sharp jaws and tell them to go down and clip the cable,” said Jim Hayes, president of the Fiber Optic Association, a nonprofit professional society based in Santa Monica, California.

Hayes said far simpler means can be found for those intent on damaging the cables, especially near the congested points where they make landfall.

“If you drag an anchor and start pulling with enough force, you can bend and kink the cable … and snap the fiber,” Hayes said.

Since the first submarine telegraphic cable was laid across the Atlantic in 1858, undersea cables have mostly been in private hands, left alone by governments and global bodies.

“Because cables aren’t owned by governments, governments have ignored them,” Schofield said.

Perhaps not entirely. The U.S. government in the 1970s is known to have tapped a cable off the Kuril Islands in eastern Russia. And in 2013, National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed that U.S. and British spy agencies were stealing data from undersea cables.

A handful of other nations are believed to have the same capabilities.

Sunak, the British parliamentarian, laid out a number of steps to protect the undersea cables in a 46-page study published Dec. 1 by Britain’s Policy Exchange think tank.

He called for enhanced global legal protections, establishing of cable protection zones above corridors used by multiple undersea cables and more robust protections at landfall sites.

“They are not secured to the level, for example, of a nuclear power station or a military base is secured at,” Sunak said in a telephone interview. “You can find them, sometimes they are just a wire fence and maybe a night-time security guy from the local town. It’s not exactly crack security against a terrorist operation.”

Sunak’s study — Undersea cables: Indispensable, insecure — calls for undersea sensors for cables, creation of backup or “dark” cables that would not be publicly identified, and recognition that an attack on cables would pose “an existential threat” to the world economy.

“We have allowed this vital infrastructure to grow increasingly vulnerable and this should worry us all,” former Navy Adm. James Stavridis, former U.S. Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, wrote in a preface to the study.

Others involved in senior U.S. cybersecurity positions concur.

“What it means is that concerned nations need to have robust capabilities to monitor those cables and to repair them or to separate any illegal intrusions,” Rand Beers, a former undersecretary of Homeland Security in the Obama administration, said in an interview.

In a statement to AFP, Denmark's foreign ministry said it was ""in ongoing dialogue with the countries most involved in handling this case, including China.""

It added that it could not provide any details on the ""diplomatic dialogue"".

Sections of two telecom cables were cut on November 17th and 18th in Swedish territorial waters of the Baltic Sea.

Swedish and Finnish police have opened investigations and European officials have said they suspect ""sabotage"" linked to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin has rejected the comments as ""absurd"" and ""laughable"".

The Yi Peng 3 sailed over the cables around the time they were severed, according to ship tracking sites, though there is nothing to indicate that it was involved in the incidents.

The ship has remained anchored in the narrow Kattegat strait between Sweden and Denmark since Tuesday.

China's foreign ministry has denied any responsibility in the matter.

""China is currently working with relevant parties including Denmark to maintain smooth communication through diplomatic channels,"" a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said Friday.

Denmark's navy said Wednesday it was shadowing the vessel, which is in international waters, limiting Danish authorities' possibility to intervene.

Sweden's coast guard joined it on Saturday.

Early on November 17, the Arelion cable running from the Swedish island of Gotland to Lithuania was damaged.

The next day, the C-Lion 1 submarine cable connecting Helsinki and the German port of Rostock was cut south of Sweden's Oland island, around 700 kilometres (435 miles) from Helsinki.

Tensions have mounted around the Baltic Sea since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

In September 2022, a series of underwater blasts ruptured the Nord Stream pipelines that carried Russian gas to Europe, the cause of which has yet to be determined.

In October 2023, an undersea gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia was shut down after it was damaged by the anchor of a Chinese cargo ship.","The article discusses Denmark's diplomatic talks with China regarding a ship linked to the cutting of two undersea cables in the Baltic Sea.

Sir Stuart Peach: Russia poses a ""new risk"" to economy and ways of living.

The UK's top military officer has warned that Russia could strike a ""catastrophic"" blow to the economy by targeting communications and internet cables that run under the sea.

Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, the chief of the defence staff, said the lines could potentially be cut or disrupted.

The suggestion raises several questions:

*   Is that something Russia's likely to do?
*   What would happen if they - or someone else - did such a thing?

**What do the cables do?**  
They provide internet and communications links between separate countries and continents.  
The full network of around 428 cables spans 683,508 miles (1.1 million km), circling the globe.  
Huge quantities of data fly around under the waves, in cables filled with fibre optics - strands of glass as thin as a sheet of paper.  
Unfortunately, while their technology is reliable, these pivotal cables are physically fragile. The fibres are encased in steel wire and then coasted in plastic - but many cables are still only around 3cm in diameter.  
Natural disasters can damage them and even a ship dropping anchor can sever a cord. That's happened before at the port of Alexandria in Egypt, straining connections between Europe, Africa and Asia.

**Why are defence chiefs worried?**  
The BBC's defence correspondent, Jonathan Beale, says fears of Russia cutting, disrupting or ""wire-tapping"" undersea communication lines are growing.  
Defence and intelligence chiefs cite the country's modernised navy, increased submarine activity and willingness to use information warfare.

Russian subs are increasingly present in the North Atlantic, particularly the GIUK Gap, a strip of ocean between Greenland, Iceland, and the UK.  
Air Chief Marshal Peach is flagging up that Britain and its Nato allies lack the subs, ships and aircraft to sustain constant vigilance.

**What would happen if the cables were cut?**  
Keir Giles, an expert in Russian information warfare who works with the Chatham House think tank, stresses that this is not a new concern.  
He thinks it's unlikely to happen as the economic fallout would also affect Russia ""but it is definitely a scenario for which they are practising"".  
And if it did happen, the damage would be considerable.  
""The fact that people wouldn't be able to log on to Facebook would be just a tiny, tiny aspect of all the disruption that would be caused if these cables were interfered with,"" says Mr Giles.  
""International trading and financial transactions are managed across sub-sea cables. The economic impact would be enormous and immediate.""

**What's in it for Russia?**  
Information control, in short.  
""They are probing the vulnerabilities of civilian communications infrastructure,"" Mr Giles says.  
""You can't see what they're doing underwater. You can see what they're doing on land or with satellites.  
What Russia learned from Crimea is that in order to take over communications for a target area you don't need expensive cyber weapons, you don't need noisy and disruptive techniques like denial of service attacks.  
All you need is physical access to the communications infrastructure and telecommunications expertise embedded with your special forces.  
They've been looking everywhere. They've been looking on land in the United States, they've been looking on land in eastern Europe... Anywhere that might in future be in an adversarial relationship with Russia should be concerned about this fixation that they have on achieving information dominance.","The article discusses the potential threat posed by Russia to undersea communication cables, directly mentioning the possibility of cutting or disrupting these cables.

Service providers quickly tried to redirect customers to the cables that had not been affected but the reduced capacity was no match for the normal workload of users, leaving an Internet service that was painfully slow or non-existent.  
by Marc Carnegie  
Hong Kong (AFP) Dec 28, 2006  
Internet and phone services were disrupted across much of Asia on Wednesday after an earthquake damaged undersea cables, leaving one of the world's most tech-savvy regions in a virtual blackout. From frustrated traders seeking in vain for stock quotes to anxious newshounds accustomed to round-the-clock updates on world events, millions of people from China to Japan to Australia were affected.  
The disruption was widespread, hitting China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong and elsewhere, with knock-on effects as far away as Australia for companies whose Internet is routed through affected areas.  
There was no chaos on the stock exchanges or any of the other doomsday scenarios, but reports that services could be down for weeks were dramatic enough.  
South Korea's information and communication ministry said all six undersea fibreoptic cables off Taiwan were hit, causing major disruption. All services, except for exclusive business lines, returned to normal shortly afterwards as they were switched to other systems.  
But officials could not put a timeframe on when business lines would be fixed. ""It is not a matter of days,"" said Hong Seoung-Yong, a ministry official handling the problem. ""It will take longer than that to repair the damaged lines.""  
A 7.1-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Taiwan on Tuesday night, which was followed by several smaller quakes in the region, apparently damaged the vast network of underwater cables that enables modern communication.  
""The Internet capacity in Taiwan is about 40 percent now, so the service is jammed,"" said a spokesman for Chunghwa Telecom, Taiwan's largest phone company.  
In China, web users in cities as far apart as Beijing in the north and Chongqing in the southwest reported difficulties accessing overseas websites, state media reported.  
The earthquake cut at least six undersea cables owned by China Telecom, one of the country's largest telecomunications and broadband providers, affecting Internet links with America, Europe and other regions, Xinhua news agency quoted the company as saying. China Mobile, another top Chinese telecom provider, also reported problems.  
Xinhua said repair work was likely to be hampered by aftershocks expected to continue for up to a week.  
Phone services in some countries were also disrupted, in particular for calls to the United States.  
""Several undersea data cables were damaged,"" said a spokesman for PCCW, Hong Kong's biggest telecoms company.  
Service providers quickly tried to redirect customers to the cables that had not been affected but the reduced capacity was no match for the normal workload of users, leaving an Internet service that was painfully slow or non-existent.  
""It's a nightmare, basically, because we have no idea what is going on in the markets today,"" said Steve Rowles, an analyst with CFC Seymour in Hong Kong, who echoed others in saying that damage was limited due to year's end.  
""It has happened on the right day as a lot of people are away for holidays, so there's low trading volumes,"" he said.  
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, the world's largest bourse outside of New York, was functioning without problems, a spokesman said.  
The Hong Kong stock exchange also said it was also working without problems, but after-hours crude trading in Singapore was affected as traders reported they could not access the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex).  
NTT Communications, the long-distance call business of Japan's largest telecom firm Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., said 1,400 toll-free phone lines and 84 international lines used internally by companies were affected.  
The crux of the trouble seemed to be in the underseas routes near Taiwan, which providers would try to bypass in favour of other routes through Europe, said a spokesman for Japanese telecoms firm KDDI Corp, Satoru Ito.  
""If there is too much traffic on that route, it might get blocked up and further slow down Internet connections,"" Ito said.  
**Earlier related report**  
**Undersea cables have the globe hardwired for communication**  
Sydney (AFP) Dec 27 - The disruption to international telecom and Internet services Wednesday caused by a strong earthquake in Taiwan highlight our increasing dependence on high-tech cable systems across the world.  
The earthquake, measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale, hit southern Taiwan hard late Tuesday and disturbed several of the massive submarine cables running offshore which link countries in Asia with the United States and beyond.  
Analysts said most international telecommunications are now carried by submarine cable, forming a multi-billion dollar network that spans the globe.  
Booming demand for increasingly sophisticated services is met by continually adding capacity but as countless users found out on Wednesday, they have become ever more dependent on a system which can be vulnerable at certain key points.  
Independent telecommications analyst Paul Budde said in a report earlier this year that the first undersea cables were laid about 150 years ago to transmit telegrams and they have evolved to reflect changing technology.  
The Australia-based analyst said it cost up to 500,000 US dollars a kilometre (1,000 yards) to lay modern cables and recently, there had been an increase in development of submarine infrastructure as demand for broadband Internet and cheap telephone services increased.  
""Changes in undersea systems have taken place on a giant scale -- not since the initial building of these networks 150 years ago have we seen such activity, mainly driven by the increase in data traffic.  
""Systems that were built as late as 1998 proved to be inadequate for the demand in capacity required a mere 18 months later.  
""Within a period of a few short years, there were ... at least 1,000 long-distance carriers and 10,000 ISP (Internet service providers) requiring global connectivity,"" he said.  
The disruption Wednesday was widespread, hitting services in China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong, with knock-on effects elsewhere.  
Operators said repairs were underway, with traffic being redirected over other cable systems in the meantime in an effort to ensure some services were available, albeit slower than normal.","The article titled ""Quake Cuts Off Much Of Asia Internet"" discusses the impact of a 7.1-magnitude earthquake that damaged several undersea cables, leading to significant internet and phone service disruptions across Asia.

It directly mentions ""undersea cables"" and details the consequences of their damage, including a reduction in internet capacity and difficulties faced by users in accessing services.

Alright. Grab your foil hats if you must, but there’s some things that need to be said here.

While working hard at my job today I was stunned after I read [engadget’s report](http://www.engadget.com/2008/02/05/fourth-undersea-cable-cut-near-uae-suspicions-rise/) that another large submarine internet cable had been severed. This comes after the news that other cables had been severed reducing the internet, phone, and television capabilities of many countries to nil. **EDIT** _Many readers have written in to inform me that Iran is, in fact, not entirely offline and that [InternetTrafficReport.com](http://www.internettrafficreport.com/asia.htm) is a terrible source. However, there are still millions of people without service. Thanks for keeping me in line._  

It seems, that something is not quite right here. Just when I am starting to doubt my gut instinct, the [Khaleej Times](http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data/theuae/2008/February/theuae_February155.xml&section=theuae) reports that it is in fact 5 submarine cables that have been damaged:

According to their reports, there was another cable severed that went unreported. So, here’s the list that they had of the 5 different cables:

We’re supposed to believe that these were most likely caused by an anchor from a ship fighting a storm. This author finds it hard to believe that this anchor was drug behind a boat from Egypt to Malaysia.

So everyone is scrambling to try and figure out why this would happen. Here’s some of the possible reasons that I have found while looking around the internet:

*   U.S. Government
*   Israeli Government
*   Aliens

"Russian-Linked Ship Spotted Near Undersea Cables","Examines the threat posed by a Russian-linked ship near undersea cables, referencing past cable damage incidents and government exercises simulating attacks on critical internet infrastructure.","https://lemmy.world/post/27137412/15903514","","",Yes,"Niall O'Connor","Germany","5000","2023-06-01","English","Lemmy.World","A cargo ship, linked to the Russian ghost fleet, which has been investigated for suspicious activity in the Baltic was spotted by an Irish Air Corps aircraft dropping an anchor close to an undersea cable in Irish waters.

It has emerged that the incident earlier this year occurred in waters off the north east coast. The Air Corps had dispatched an aircraft to monitor its movements as it is a list of Russian related vessels.

There have been several incidents in the Baltic Sea where anchors, dropped by Russian linked vessels, have damaged critical internet cables.

The Air Corps was able to film the ship, dropping the anchor in the area, and following communication from the Irish crew the cargo vessel fled. It was not confirmed if the ship was intentionally targeting undersea infrastructure or if it was a case of bad seamanship.

The ship, sailing under a flag from the Caribbean region, had been in trouble in the Baltic Sea in the same month. German authorities escorted it out of the area along with Swedish and Danish naval colleagues.

On that occasion, she was sailing from St Petersburg en route through the waters near Gotland, an island off Sweden.

The sighting of it in Irish waters was made earlier this year and it was being monitored after intelligence was shared from a friendly nation with the Irish State.

An Irish Air Corps maritime patrol vessel was dispatched to keep watch – it is understood that they recorded it, using specialist camera equipment, as it dropped the anchor.

It is understood the ship was contacted by radio by the Irish Defence Forces and directed to haul its anchor back up and it departed the area.

The Journal has learned that the ship is back in Irish waters and is heading towards the west coast.

It is understood that the ship has steamed from the Bay of Biscay and is currently off the Cork and Kerry coast.

Using an open source flight monitoring service, The Journal was able to follow an Air Corps CASA 295 aircraft which went to a location near the ship this afternoon.

This publication has previously revealed that Ireland held a major exercise behind closed doors to test how Ireland will deal with a complete loss of the internet after a targeted attack.

It is understood that the event, known as a tabletop exercise, was held in February and involved multiple Government departments and agencies including the Defence Forces, An Garda Síochána and other emergency services.

The scenario was a concerted cyber attack which was combined with the loss of multiple undersea cables.

There are a large number of fibre optic internet cables connecting Europe to the US and other parts of the world running through Irish waters. They carry all high speed internet traffic, including banking and other critical data.","The article discusses a Russian-linked ship dropping anchor near an undersea cable, which is a direct reference to the topic of cut sea cables.

It highlights previous incidents where Russian vessels have damaged critical internet cables and mentions the implications of undersea cables on internet connectivity.

Furthermore, the article references a government exercise that involved scenarios of losing multiple undersea cables due to attacks, reinforcing its focus on the topic.

Therefore, the article treats cut sea cables as a central theme rather than a minor mention."

The Internet is the thread that ties billions of people together for work, study, socializing, shopping, and gaming.

Much of the traffic generated from these activities is derived from the US and Europe. It makes its way to all other parts of the world through a vast network of data centers, routers, and switches interconnected globally by an array of submarine cables.

![Submarine Cable Map](https://pulse.internetsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Submarine_Cable_Map_2024_Global-eecc19b91a550daad0022ed71a11b951.jpeg)

Currently, around [559 submarine cable systems](https://blog.telegeography.com/this-is-not-a-drill-the-2024-submarine-cable-map-is-here) span [1.5 million kilometers](https://www.kentik.com/blog/diving-deep-into-submarine-cables-undersea-lifelines-of-internet-connectivity/), connecting the smallest Pacific islands to the largest economies of Europe, Asia, and North America. As of 2023, 98% of all global Internet traffic was carried by submarine cables, carrying [USD 9.47 Trillion in daily financial transactions](https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/fintech/digital-payments/worldwide).

Unfortunately, most businesses are not prepared for significant Internet disruption from whatever cause.

### Cable ‘Choke Points’ Impact Internet Resilience

By the nature of geography, the cables that span the world have ‘choke points’ where the volume and proximity of cables on the sea bed are greater. These places include:

*   The Suez Canal/Red Sea, a prime route for East-West connectivity
*   Singapore, the key South East Asia hub
*   Malta and Gibraltar, for European and African access.

Having so many cables nearby increases the risk of damage to one or multiple cables, which decreases the resilience of the Internet. This risk has been exposed recently in the Red Sea and off the coast of West Africa, where multiple submarine cables have been damaged from unforeseen circumstances.

Read: [Internet Society’s 2024 West Africa Submarine Cable Outage Report](https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2024/2024-west-africa-submarine-cable-outage-report/)

According to the United Nations, [150 to 200 subsea cable faults occur annually](https://www.csis.org/analysis/invisible-and-vital-undersea-cables-and-transatlantic-security). Fishing and shipping activities account for nearly two-thirds of the total (Figure 2).

Fishing techniques that touch the sea floor, such as trawl nets and dredges, are hazardous for cables but remain popular in parts of Asia. Anchoring incidents often occur when anchors are inadvertently dropped and dragged along the sea floor. Extreme weather and strong tides can also drag properly anchored boats into cables.

![Causes of Submarine Cable Faults](https://pulse.internetsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/causes-of-cable-faults.png)

Figure 2 — Causes of submarine cable faults. Source: [Telegeography](https://blog.telegeography.com/what-happens-when-submarine-cables-break).

Cable planners take several steps to minimize these risks, including:

*   Wrapping cables in armor and sometimes burying them deep when nearer to shore, where most fishing activities occur.
*   Coordinating with fishing crews and fleets.
*   Avoiding designated areas where ships anchor.

Proactive government efforts, including international treaties, some dating back to 1884, guarantee unique freedoms to lay, repair, and maintain cables, although national practices vary.

### Economic Cost of Cable Cuts

Economic disruption and impact following disruption to undersea Internet network infrastructure is becoming a priority for many national risk registers.

Estimating the financial impact of a submarine cable cut is tricky, given that nearly all are privately owned. A recent [report](https://subtelforum.com/8m-to-restore-subsea-cable-services/) suggested that it costs the West Indian Ocean Cable Company USD 2M to repair a single cable off the coast of West Africa. This does not consider the cost of lost traffic, the impact on reputation and insurance premiums, and the cost to service providers who need to purchase capacity on other submarine cables during restoration. Given that a typical deep-sea repair will take 3—5 days with favorable conditions, the cost can escalate quickly.

Many large global Internet service providers, such as Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, are investing in cable systems across all regions to provide diversity and increase the security of services for customers. However, it’s also up to businesses and Internet users to understand and advocate for protecting and maintaining these underwater threads that connect us. This includes:

*   Understanding where your business data is sourced, stored, and transmitted.
*   Forecasting and mitigating risks associated with non-locally stored data, including having alternative data hosting and backup and local data caching.

Ultimately, there is no single solution, and much will depend on risk profiles and data-critical applications. The important thing is to be proactive for the day when (not if) your services are compromised by a submarine cable outage.

Yesterday, Egypt's Coast Guard stumbled upon a suspicious fishing boat off the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria. There's no word on what tipped them off, but upon investigation, they caught the team of divers up to no good and apparently mid-cut. The cable in question is owned by Egypt Telecom, the country's monopoly landline provider, making it sort of an important link in [the vast network of undersea Internet connections](https://gizmodo.com/these-are-all-the-cables-that-carry-the-internet-under-5980965).

The Official Military Spokesman of the Armed Forces of Egypt put it this way [in a statement on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Egy.Army.Spox/posts/292211947576461) (translated):  
> [The] Navy today successfully foiled 3 divers, while they cut submarine cable for connection to the Internet, the company's Telecom Egypt, near the coast of Shatby in Alexandria ...

Less than 48 hours after the powerful quake ruptured the two crucial cables off Taiwan's southern tip, companies from South Korea to Singapore said they managed to partially restore most of their service to millions of customers.

They did it by rerouting traffic through satellites and cables that weren't damaged by the 6.7-magnitude tremor that killed two people.

Four repair ships were sailing to the quake zone, but they weren't expected to arrive until Tuesday, said Lin Jen-hung, vice-general manager of Chunghwa Telecom Co., Taiwan's biggest phone company.

The crews would need to find the fault, survey the conditions and pull up the cables for repair _ a job Chunghwa said could take two weeks.

Most international Internet data and voice calls travel as pulses of light through hundreds of undersea fiber optic cables crisscrossing the globe. The cables _ clusters of glass fibers enclosed in protective material _ are often owned by groups of telecom companies, who share costs and capacity.

""Cables break all over the place, from sharks nibbling, anchors dragged across,"" said Markus Buchhorn, an information technology expert at Australia National University.

But Buchhorn added the broken cables become a problem if _ like in the Taiwanese case _ several snap at the same time and there are not immediate backup lines to keep the traffic flowing.

Chunghwa estimated its revenue loss from the earthquake damage at about $3 million. Repairing the cables would cost about $1.53 million, the company said in a filing to the Taiwan Stock Exchange.

Millions of people were affected by the breakdown in the main fibre-optic link beneath the Arabian Sea 35 kilometers (21 miles) south of Karachi, which was detected late Monday, officials and Internet service providers said.

The complex repair work may require a complete shut down, potentially causing disruption in India, the United Arab Emirates, Djibouti and Oman, which are also linked to the damaged cable, officials said.

""This is a highly sophisticated operation and only specialised companies can undertake such a delicate task under the sea,"" Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) chief engineer Shahid Ahmed told AFP.

""Pakistan has no such ability.""

The cable is owned by a consortium of 92 countries with Singtel of Singapore acting as its operating agents. Singtel this month lost out on a bid for a key stake in the privatisation of state-run PTCL.

""We are holding a multilateral conference to fix the problem and asked Singtel to arrange for the rectification of the fault,"" Ahmed said.

He said Singtel has appointed E-Marine, a UAE-based company, to fix the fault. They had dispatched a ship which may take 18 to 24 hours to reach the site, he added.

Pakistan has more than 10 million Internet users, general secretary of Internet Service Providers (ISP) Association, V.A. Abdi said.

""I fear it could take two weeks to repair because it will require the removal of the faulty portion of the cable,"" Abid told AFP.

""The cable provides Pakistan's major outer communication means and its fault has disrupted almost all communications with the rest of the world.""

The cable fault is the latest problem to hit Pakistan's long-suffering telecoms users.

Services were affected earlier this month when tens of thousands of workers went on strike to protest at the privatisation of PTCL. At one point troops and police seized control of the firm's premises.

Earlier this month, some people in Northern Ireland started seeing their broadband speeds slow right down. How come? Well it turns out that an undersea fibre optic cable that supplies Northern Ireland with Virgin Media's broadband had broken. Fixing it would involve a crack team of specialist engineers, a boat and a robot.

97% of the world’s communications are carried by underwater cables. There are 277 globally, more than 20 of which connect to the UK. This is how they get laid:

Unfortunately, they can easily be torn by earthquakes, ships' anchors or trawler nets used in fishing. When that happens, they need repairing. Quickly.

That's where Peter Jamieson comes in. He's the lead engineer at Virgin Media and will be the first to be alerted when there’s a problem with one of the company’s two fibre optic cables in the Irish Sea.

If there's ever a breakage - and there have been two for the company in 7 years - the signal between the two ends of the cable will be disrupted, triggering an alarm.

""We’ll send out an engineer to both ends of the cable within about 30 minutes,"" says Jamieson. The engineer will carry out tests that will reveal the distance along the cable where the tear is.

""Then I call out a repair ship, which mobilises in about an hour,"" he says. ""Every cable damaged is an emergency, so we’ll try to fix it as quickly as we can.""

In this case, the ship called was the 100m-long Pierre de Fermat - which is shared by a consortium of companies that rely on undersea cables.

Once the ship reaches the right spot - which can take several days depending on where it's docked - the robot steps in. The Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) is dropped down into the water to inspect the damage.

Once it's found the break point, it will raise both sides of the cable to the surface so that engineers can repair it. The entire cable is just 6cm in diameter. ""People imagine them to be really big, chunky things, but they’re not,"" says Jamieson.

Inside the cable are 48 fibres, each of which is capable of taking eighty-eight 100 gigabit channels. ""One cable could take all the traffic from the UK,"" he adds.

The engineers take time to carefully splice in a new section of cable, connecting all of the fibres together. ""That’s the bit you've got to get right - it has to be perfect every time,"" he says. ""Once you put it back on the seabed you don’t want to go back again.""

Once it's fixed, the robot returns the cable to the seabed and buries it. The fibre is back in business, and Northern Irish customers can go back to enjoying cat videos.","The article discusses undersea cables in detail, including specific incidents of breakage affecting broadband services.

It describes the processes involved in repairing these cables and the implications of their damage on internet connectivity.

"Vocus Confirms Subsea Cable Outage","Details the SEA-ME-WE3 cable break causing significant latency issues for customers between Perth and Singapore, affecting multiple subsea cables.","https://www.zdnet.com/article/vocus-confirms-subsea-cable-outage","2017-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","Written by Corinne Reichert, Contributor Aug. 29, 2017 at 6:55 p.m. PT",Yes,"Corinne Reichert","New York, NY, USA","100000","2017-08-30","English","ZDNet","Vocus Communications has confirmed that the SEA-ME-WE3 (SMW3) subsea cable is down between Perth and Singapore due to a break in the line.

The cable system, which services South East Asia, the Middle East, and Western Europe, should be repaired by October 13, although Vocus said this is a ""tentative"" date that could change.

""SEA-ME-WE3 submarine cable between Perth and Singapore is currently down due to a confirmed cable break,"" Vocus said on Wednesday morning.

""Customers can expect to see increased latency to Asian destinations until this link is restored.""

According to a report by Viet Nam News, the Asia-America Gateway (AAG) and the Intra-Asia (IA) subsea cable systems are also currently down, with the AAG broken at two spots around 66km and 85km from the cable landing station in Hong Kong and the IA cable broken around 54km from Hong Kong.

""Internet providers in Viet Nam failed to provide an explanation as to why all three internet cables were down at the same time and were unclear about the timeline of when the cables would be fixed,"" the report said.

The SMW3 also suffered an outage due to the cable being severed back in 2013.

Vocus is currently working on constructing a replacement cable system for the SMW3, last week announcing that its Australia Singapore Cable (ASC) will be completed ahead of schedule, with services expected to launch in July next year.

Initially planned for September 2018, Vocus said that despite adding a spur to Christmas Island, the subsea cable will be ready to go live in less than a year ahead of competitor cable systems Indigo and Trident.

Trident, Indigo, and the ASC are all aimed at replacing the slower-speed SMW3 cable, which currently carries data traffic between Australia and Singapore.

Vocus signed Alcatel-Lucent Submarine Networks in December to help build the 4,600-kilometre ASC, which is designed to carry 40Tbps at a minimum across four fibre pairs.

According to Vocus, the ASC is the only submarine cable system to have all landing party permits and approvals in both Indonesia and Singapore, and to have a ""ready and waiting"" fibre network across Australia that's able to transport traffic from Asia to all Australian capital cities, with construction now under way at the landing sites in Singapore, Indonesia, and Perth.

The ASC's marine route survey and full system design have been completed and the marine transmission system manufacturing is ""in full swing"", Vocus said, with 50 percent of the work done on the marine cable, 80 percent on the land-based electronics and power systems, and 40 percent on the subsea electronics systems.

Originally a 50-50 joint-venture deal between Vocus and Nextgen Networks, the ASC will connect Perth with Singapore and Indonesia at a cost of AU$170 million.

Vocus subsequently purchased Nextgen Networks for AU$700 million in June 2016, paying an additional AU$27 million for the ASC and AU$134 million for the North West Cable System (NWCS).

The 28Tbps two-pair fibre-optic, 1,070-kilometre Trident subsea cable will connect Singapore, Indonesia, and Australia, with stage one slated to go live in April this year and the entire cable to be completed by the second quarter of 2018. It utilises 100Gbps coherent dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) technology, which is upgradeable to 400Gbps.

The Indigo subsea cable system, announced earlier this year, will connect Sydney, Perth, Singapore, and Jakarta, spanning around 9,000km with two fibre pairs and a design capacity of 18Tbps.

Indigo is expected to be completed by mid-2019.","The article titled 'Vocus confirms subsea cable outage' provides a detailed account of the SEA-ME-WE3 subsea cable break between Perth and Singapore, confirming a significant outage.

Grappling and dragging techniques used in ongoing efforts to repair undersea optic fibre cables damaged in the December 26 Taiwan quake that disrupted Internet services for millions of users in the Asia-Pacific region.  

by Ian Timberlake  
Singapore (AFP) Jan 12, 2007  
Workers are relying on 19th century technology to fix a very 21st century problem -- disruption of the Internet traffic that tech-savvy Asia relies on. Crewmen on boats south of Taiwan are dragging the seabed with grappling hooks at the end of long ropes to recover fibre optic cables damaged in a 7.1-magnitude earthquake that struck the region on December 26.  

""No electronics involved,"" said John Walters, general manager of Global Marine, one of the firms engaged in the repairs. ""It's an old and traditional technique.""  

Millions of people across the region, in Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and as far away as Australia, suffered Internet and telephone blackouts when the cables, linking Asian countries with the US and beyond, were damaged.  

Telecom operators have diverted the traffic to allow service to return to normal but the repair work continues.  

""At this point none of those cables have been repaired,"" Walters told AFP in an interview.  

""We are talking about cable that's lying on the surface of the seabed down to about 4,000 metres (2.5 miles),"" said Walters.  

Global Marine has two ships in the Bashi Channel and Luzon Strait area, between Taiwan and the Philippines, while other firms have provided four more ships, he said.  

The vessels, specially designed to repair submarine cables, are more than 100 metres (yards) long and carry about 60 British officers and Filipino crewmen, he said.  

They work 24 hours a day but the weather can hinder their progress. Walters said one ship is waiting for 30 to 40 mile-an-hour winds (48 to 64 kilometres- an-hour) to die down in the Bashi Channel. The winds have stirred up 10 to 12 metre waves.  

The second Global Marine vessel is closer to Taiwan and has been able to continue work, he said.  

After arriving at the scene they survey the ocean bottom to assess whether the contour has changed, and the degree of sediment movement.  

Then the traditional tools are brought out. A rope with a grapnel on the end is played out, down into the depths, and towed over the sea floor until tension registers on a graph on the ship, indicating contact has been made with the cable.  

Today's fibre optic cables are just 21 millimetres in diameter.  

""You can understand the magnitude of the difficulty that we have,"" said Walters, who has 17 years' experience.  

""What's key is the speed of the cable ship.""  

The grapnel is a metal tool about 18 by 24 inches (46 by 61 centimetres) which includes a cutter, like a fine razor blade, and a grabbing tool.  

As tension increases and the cable is slowly pulled up, it is cut, grabbed, and half of it is hoisted to the surface.  

Dropping the grapnel, dragging the sea bed and recovering the cable can take about 16 hours, Walters said.  

""It is a tried and tested method.""  

Once the severed half of the cable is on board the boat, debris is cleared from the damaged end, it is tested, sealed and the end boiled off. Then it is attached to a buoy on the water surface while the process is repeated for the second half of the cable before both halves are spliced together and dropped back to the ocean floor.  

Even before the Boxing Day earthquake, Global Marine had faced a busy year, with about 20 repairs after damage from fishermen or anchors. All those ruptures were fixed using the old grapnel method, he said.  

Global Marine has remotely-operated vehicles, a type of underwater robot, but they cannot operate below a depth of about 2,000 metres and are usually employed to bury a repaired cable in shallower water, he said.  

They are not quicker than grapnels, either.  

""We've learned our lessons, if you like, from history,"" Walters said, whose UK-based firm traces its origins back to 1850 when the first international submarine cable was laid between Britain and France.  

Grapnel design has evolved over the past century, giving operators a variety of tools to choose from depending on the underwater terrain, he said.  

A single cable repair can take about seven days but on this mission, most operators are quoting a 10-day repair period, he said. With about eight separate cable systems in the waters off Taiwan, and close to 18 faults caused by the earthquake, repairs will take time.  

""We anticipate that all of these systems should be repaired -- we're talking about end February,"" Walters said.","The article discusses the repair of undersea optic fibre cables damaged by an earthquake, detailing the implications for internet connectivity across multiple countries.

It directly mentions 'undersea cables' and thoroughly covers the repair efforts, making this a central theme of the article.

The disruption of services for millions and the methods used for repairs further emphasize the relevance of cut sea cables."
"Cables Connect the Digital World","Disruptions in communications across the Middle East and Asia due to the cutting of FLAGEurope-Asia and SeaMeWe-4 cables; challenges in repair exacerbated by poor weather.","https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Cables-connect-the-digital-world-3230242.php","2023-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","Peter Svensson; Associated Press",Yes,"Peter Svensson","San Francisco, California, US","27500000","2023-02-06","English","SFGATE","The lines that tie the globe together by carrying phone calls and Internet traffic are just two-thirds of an inch thick where they lie on the ocean floor.

The foundation for a connected world seems quite fragile - an impression reinforced this week when a break in two cables in the Mediterranean Sea disrupted communications across the Middle East and Asia.

India took one of the biggest hits, and the damage from its slowdowns and outages rippled to some U.S. and European companies that rely on its lucrative outsourcing industry to handle customer service calls and other operations.

Yet the cable network itself is fairly resilient. In fact, cables are broken all the time, usually by fishing lines and ship anchors, and few of us notice. It takes a confluence of factors for a cable break to cause an outage.

""Most telecom companies have capacity at multiple systems, so if one goes out, they simply reroute to a different system,"" said Stephan Beckert, analyst at research firm TeleGeography in Washington. ""It's just that in this case, both the main route and the backup route got cut for a lot of companies.""

The two cables - FLAGEurope-Asia and SeaMeWe-4 - were cut on the ocean floor just north of Alexandria, Egypt. There was speculation a ship's anchor might be to blame.

Egyptian officials said initial attempts to reach the cables were stymied by poor weather. Repairs could take a week once workers arrive at the site, and engineers were scrambling to reroute traffic to satellites and to other cables.

By an accident of geography and global politics, Egypt is a choke point in the global communications network, just as it is with global shipping. The reasons are the same: The country touches both the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, which flows into the India Ocean.

The slim fiber-optic cables that carry the world's communications are much like ships, in that they're the cheapest way for carrying things over long distances. Pulling cable overland is much more expensive and requires negotiation with landowners and governments.

So fiber-optic cables that go from Europe to India take the sea route via Egypt's Suez Canal, just as ships do.

Another Mediterranean cable makes land not far away, in Israel. But there's no cable overland from Israel into Jordan and to the Persian Gulf, which could have provided a redundant connection for the Gulf States and India. Going overland would have been more expensive and politically difficult - Israel and Arab countries would have to cooperate.

There is also no route that goes through Russia, Iran and Pakistan to India. The terrain is rugged, Pakistan is politically unstable, and India and Pakistan are not on good terms.

With two of the three cables passing through Suez cut, traffic from the Middle East and India intended for Europe was forced to route eastward, around most of the globe.

The main route goes through Japan and the United States, crossing both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. According to Beckert, this is normally the cheap way to go for Indian traffic, because capacity is high. However, the distance means more time required to reach Europe and get a response.

The other route from India to Europe goes over China into Russia and along the Trans-Siberian railroad.

Egypt is not the only choke point in the global network. The ocean just south of Taiwan proved to be one in December 2006, when an earthquake cut seven of eight cables passing through the area, slowing down communications in Hong Kong and other parts of Asia for months.

Another possible vulnerability is the U.S. island of Guam in the Pacific Ocean. It is the spider at the center of a web of cables from the United States, Japan, Australia, the Philippines and China.

Both cables that connect the United States to Australia and New Zealand run over Hawaii, creating another choke point.

These bottlenecks are likely to go away, however, as telecoms build more lines. But it will be years before the network across Asia is as resilient as the trans-Atlantic network, where multiple high-capacity lines over different routes provide a connection that's almost impossible to disrupt. And the factors that make the Suez Canal a vulnerable point now will likely remain.

Mustafa Alani, head of the security and terrorism department at the Gulf Research Center in Dubai, said the outage should be a ""wake-up call"" for governments and professionals to divert more resources to protect vital infrastructure.

""This shows how easy it would be to attack"" communications networks, he said.

Yet the owners of the undersea cables aren't concerned with terrorism, according to Beckert. They're too busy worrying about fishing boats.

""They want to publish maps of their cables as widely as possible, so fishing crews know where they are,"" Beckert said. ""The risk of accidental cuts is much, much greater than the risk of deliberate cuts.""

"Security Challenges and Governance of Submarine Cables in the Indo-Pacific","Explores vulnerabilities of submarine cables, including risks from accidental damage and sabotage, impacting global internet connectivity and supply chains.","https://www.melbourneasiareview.edu.au/securing-the-backbone-security-challenges-to-and-governance-of-submarine-cables-in-the-indo-pacific","","",Yes,"Jeslyn Tan","Parkville, Victoria, Australia","800","2024-02-06","English","Melbourne Asia Review","**Securing the backbone: Security challenges to and governance of submarine cables in the Indo-Pacific**  
**Author:** Jeslyn Tan  
**Published Date:** 06/02/2024  

Submarine cables form the backbone of international communication, responsible for 99 percent of international data traffic. Submarine cables are more feasible than satellites in terms of data transmission due to their high-capacity and low-latency. This means that fibre-optic cables are able to transmit large data volumes more rapidly and at relatively low cost compared with satellites.

In an era where digital connectivity is the lifeblood of economies and societies, submarine cables play a pivotal role in facilitating seamless communication, commerce, and collaboration on a global scale. This intricate web of fibre-optic cables on the ocean floor transports internet traffic essential for trade, defence, diplomacy, healthcare, and entertainment and underpins daily activities such as data transfers, emails, voice calls, video conferences, and financial transactions.

In the context of global supply chains, the importance of submarine cables cannot be overstated, particularly in the dynamic and economically vital region of the Indo-Pacific.

Despite the importance of submarine cables to the global supply chain and economy, this critical infrastructure is vulnerable to attack and damage, both intentional and unintentional. Attacks on submarine cables can be physical due to human activities at sea or cyberattacks which target cable landing stations and the network management systems used to monitor the cables remotely.

**Physical security risks**  
Submarine cables are vulnerable to a range of physical security risks due to their underwater placement and extensive geographical coverage. These risks can include accidental damage from ship anchors or fishing activities, intentional sabotage, and natural disasters such as earthquakes or undersea landslides. According to the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC), the majority of cable damage is caused by unintentional human activities at sea, with fishing accounting for almost half of the cable faults.

In the Indo-Pacific, several notable cases of damage to submarine cables in 2023 were reported in the waters of Guam, Taiwan, Vietnam, and the Solomon Islands. In February 2023, all five submarine cables that connect Vietnam globally malfunctioned simultaneously, impacting data flow, internet speed, and business operations. All five cables were only fully repaired by November 2023.

Due to the lack of advanced surveillance and monitoring systems for undersea infrastructure, it is difficult for maritime law enforcement agencies to prevent deliberate cable damage. Reports of these incidents are then shared by organisations such as the Information Fusion Centre (IFC) which notifies regional countries.

**Cybersecurity risks**  
Submarine cables are prone to cyberattacks or espionage by either state or non-state actors as part of grey-zone tactics. In recent years, competition between states has intensified, leading to increased risks for these cables.

On Christmas Day, an undersea power cable connecting Finland and Estonia, known as the Estlink-2, was severed, cut in an area where the seabed is difficult to access naturally.

Finnish authorities detected the damage during routine monitoring and quickly launched an investigation.

Late Sunday, Finnish police chief investigator Sami Paila told Finnish National Broadcaster Yle that police discovered an anchor drag trail extended for ""dozens of kilometers ... if not almost 100 kilometers (62 miles),"" suggesting deliberate actions.

This disruption, although having little immediate impact on services, has underscored the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure in the Baltic Sea.

The incident also followed damage to two data cables in November and bombings of the Nord Stream gas pipelines in 2022. Investigators of those incidents have said the cables and pipelines were deliberately targeted.

### The ship detained by Finland passed over the cables, investigators say

Finnish investigators have detained the Eagle S, a 70,000-ton crude oil tanker registered in the Cook Islands.

The vessel was operating in the vicinity of the cables at the time of the incident and had set off from Russia the day before. Finnish authorities said they noticed the Eagle S had slowed down as it passed over the cables at around the same time that the incident occurred.

Finland's National Bureau of Investigation on Saturday said it was investigating the ship under criminal charges including aggravated criminal mischief and aggravated interference of communications. It also said the ship's crew members were being questioned.

Authorities confiscated material from the ship for analysis, a process they said could take several months to complete.

### European leaders condemned the incident but have yet to publicly blame Russia

European leaders have condemned the incident, emphasizing the urgency of protecting critical infrastructure.

""Undersea cables and pipelines connecting our countries across the Baltic Sea have been there for years without any major incidents nor damages,"" Lauri Läänemets, Estonia's interior minister, told NPR, adding: ""It is highly unlikely, even naïve to think that 3 such incidents in just a year could be merely a coincidence.""

Läänemets was cautious about directly blaming Russia for this latest incident as Finland continues its investigation, but he did say Europe needed ""to take decisive steps sanctioning Russia's shadow fleet operating on the Baltic Sea.""

Undersea cables provide a large source of electricity to Estonia and other Baltic states. Fingrid, Finland's electricity transmission operator, said the repair could take months and warned the cable cut risked making it ""more likely that the power situation will become tight"" for Estonians.

Finland and Estonia promptly called on NATO to bolster its presence in the Baltic Sea.

NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte announced plans to enhance military operations in the region, including naval patrols.

But some accuse the EU of not being quick enough.

""We have been too slow in our action,"" Marko Mihkelson, the chair of the Estonian Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, told NPR on Friday, referring to the EU's failure to respond to previous similar incidents.

In November, two fiber-optic Baltic Sea cables were severed. German officials called it sabotage and the Danish navy stopped a Chinese cargo ship that passed over both cables.

In October 2023, a Chinese ship dragged its anchor hundreds of miles, destroying undersea cables and an undersea gas line connecting Finland and Estonia. China said its ship was responsible but said it was an accident.

""We said after the NATO membership of Sweden and Finland, that the Baltic Sea is like a NATO lake. Is it? What can we do to secure critical infrastructure?"" Mihkelson said, adding he would ""like to see more robust action from the side of NATO.""

The European Commission has proposed targeted sanctions against Russia's shadow fleet. These measures aim to deter future sabotage and reduce the fleet's impact on global security and the environment.

### What to know about Russia's alleged ""shadow fleet""

Russia's shadow fleet refers to a network of older vessels used to evade Western sanctions and, allegedly, conduct covert operations. The ships take steps to sell Russian oil while concealing its origin.

These tankers often operate without Western-regulated insurance and employ tactics such as signal jamming to hide their movements. Many are registered under foreign flags to obscure their origins.

Following the European Union's price cap on Russian oil, nearly 70% of Russia's oil exports are now transported by these fleets, according to a European Parliament briefing.

Analysts believe the Kremlin has invested billions to expand this network, with the alleged covert operations being used to create instability across Europe.

""Russia has dramatically stepped up its game in its operations against democratic European countries,"" Janne Riihelainen, a national security columnist for multiple Finnish news outlets, told NPR.

He added: ""Russia is stepping up pressure against the West amid its continued support for Ukraine by trying to disrupt the lives of everyday people.","The article titled ""What to know about Finland, Russia and a severed undersea cable"" discusses the severing of the Estlink-2 undersea power cable connecting Finland and Estonia.

It details the investigation into the incident, linking it to a Russian-affiliated vessel and highlighting the implications for European infrastructure security.

The article mentions the cut cable as a central theme, discussing its impact on electricity supply and the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure in the Baltic Sea.

Given these points, the article clearly meets the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables."

more often than you’d think  

also from what i know the first 2 cables got cut at the same time so i assume they were damaged by the same cause (anchor from a ship apparently)

Well, if you read “Blind Man’s Bluff” about US undersea operations, you’d know how this stuff happens. The question is whether this has anything to do with preparing for an upcoming US attack on Iran.

Paul,  
sea cables often rip apart. Around the world such a cable breaks every few days. Usually the public only takes notice when multiple breaks occur at a single place like next to Taiwan some years ago.

On the recent cable ruptures:  
There was a bad weather system in the south-east Mediterranean which then moved eastwards to the Gulf.  
It first ripped apart two lines a few miles off Alexandria, Egypt. Because two lines broke at the same time, the public took notice.

The line breaks may have been through ships slipping/dragging in the storm with anchors down in relatively shallow water or simply by sea ground waves.

Alexandria is (for far too long) known as a quite critical point of failure for global internet traffic because too many sea cables are landing there without structural redundancy.

As the bad weather moved east, a line off Dubai broke. This is the third line that has you wondering. There the line is part of the FALCON ring cable structure and one cut in a ring still allows traffic to be rerouted across the other leg.

According to FLAG Telecom, the cable owner, traffic on the Persian Gulf system is by now mostly restored despite that cut. As they also report the repair ship there (UAE) is not allowed to leave the harbor by officials because of bad weather!

There are currently some rumors on conspiracy sites that say a fourth cable is cut in the Gulf and Iran’s internet is down.

These rumors are definitely FALSE AND UNFOUNDED! (Yes, I have tested the connections and the “evidence”.)

I have some years of professional experience with the business and technical sides of such lines.  
Currently I have no interest and relation to them or the involved companies.

Two undersea cables carrying internet data deep in the Baltic Sea were damaged, European telecommunications companies said this week, drawing warnings from European governments of possible Russian ""hybrid warfare"" targeting global communications infrastructure.

On Wednesday, interest was focused on a Chinese-flagged cargo ship called the Yi Peng 3, which data provided by the maritime tracking service Vessel Finder showed to have been in the area around the time the cables were damaged.

The Yi Peng was anchored Wednesday in Danish waters, and Denmark's military confirmed in a brief statement that it had a presence near the vessel, offering no further information. Vessel Finder tracking data showed a Danish navy patrol ship close to the anchored cargo vessel.

According to data from Vessel Finder, the bulk carrier, owned by Chinese firm Ningbo Yipeng Shipping Co. Ltd, departing from the remote northwest Russian port of Ust-Luga on Nov. 15, with a scheduled Dec. 3 arrival at Egypt's Port Said.

Speaking to reporters Wednesday in Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied any Russian involvement in the cables being damaged, calling it ""quite absurd to continue to blame Russia for everything without any grounds."" Peskov suggested Ukraine could have been behind sabotaging the cables.

The Finnish company Cinia confirmed that its submarine cable between Finland and Germany was damaged in the early hours of Monday morning. The cable is about 730 miles long and connects telecommunications networks in central Europe to Finland and other Nordic countries.

""The details of the fault are yet not known and are currently being investigated,"" the company said in a statement on its website.

The foreign ministers of Finland and Germany said in a joint statement Monday that a cable connecting the two countries had been cut and that the incidents had raised suspicion of possible sabotage.

""A thorough investigation is underway. Our European security is not only under threat from Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, but also from hybrid warfare by malicious actors,"" the ministers said, without blaming any particular entity for the possible sabotage.

Swedish company Arelion confirmed to CBS News on Tuesday that one of its cables had also been damaged, on Sunday morning.

""We can confirm that one of our subsea fiber cables — the one between Gotland, Sweden and Šventoji, Lithuania — is damaged. The issue was detected on November 17, and we currently do not know what caused it as we have not been able to examine the cable,"" Arelion spokesperson Martin Sjögren told CBS News.

""Arelion is in contact with Swedish authorities and the Swedish Armed Forces regarding the incident. The cable will be repaired over the next few weeks depending on weather conditions,"" he said.

The Swedish Prosecutor's office confirmed to CBS News Wednesday that there was an ongoing investigation into ""sabotage in the Baltic sea."" In a separate statement, Sweden's national police force confirmed it was, ""also interested in a ship seen at the locations in question. It [the ship] is not currently in Swedish waters.""

""If I had a nickel for every time a Chinese ship was dragging its anchor on the bottom of the Baltic Sea in the vicinity of important cables I would have two nickels, which isn't much, but it's weird that it happened twice,"" Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said in a statement posted on social media.

Audrius Stasiulaitis, a spokesperson for the Swedish multinational telecom company Telia, which uses and operates the Arelion cable, said Tuesday that the company believed the cable had been physically damaged.

""We can only speculate on what has happened, but as far as we see, it is not affected by equipment failure and we presume it's physical damage,"" he told CBS News over the phone.

The damage to the cables comes after reports over the past year that Russia may be targeting key infrastructure connecting Nordic countries.

An April 2023 joint investigation by the public broadcasters of Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland found that Moscow was operating a fleet of suspected intelligence vessels in Nordic waters as part of a Kremlin campaign potentially aimed at targeting underwater cables and wind farms.

There have been attacks on European infrastructure since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine 1,000 days ago. In September 2022, the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines, both designed to carry natural gas from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea, were damaged by explosions.

Both Ukraine and Russia denied any involvement in the explosions. In August, German media reported that prosecutors had issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian man over the pipeline attacks.

Sweden and Finland have both joined the NATO military alliance over the past two years, as the war in Ukraine fuels concern about Russia's possible intentions, and just this week, both countries updated their war preparation guidance and published online booklets for citizens to prepare for the eventuality of a war or other crisis.","The article titled ""Undersea cables cut or damaged, leading European nations to investigate possible sabotage"" discusses the damage to undersea cables in detail.

The fault knocked out 70% of Nigeria's bandwidth, causing severe problems for its banking sector, government and mobile phone networks. 

Services were severely disrupted or knocked out in Togo, Niger and Benin. 

Countries had to either reroute traffic overland or use expensive satellite links to maintain connectivity. 

Nigeria was particularly badly hit because around 70% of its bandwidth is routed through neighbouring Benin. 

The network, run by Suburban Telecom, was set up to bypass Nigeria's principal telecoms operator Nitel which runs the SAT-3 branch cable which lands in Nigeria.

""Einige Fachleute bezweifeln, dass ankernde Schiffe die Kabel versehentlich zerrissen haben könnten"", sagte Al Basheer bei einer Sicherheitskonferenz in Katar, ""schließlich verlaufen die Kabel in großen Tiefen und in Gebieten, die von Schiffen nicht passiert werden dürfen"".

Ende Januar waren im Mittelmeer vor Ägypten zunächst die beiden Europa-Asien-Kabel FEA (FLAG Europe Asia) und SEA-ME-WE 4 beschädigt worden. Zwei Tage später musste die FLAG Telecom Group auch den Ausfall des um die Arabische Halbinsel führenden FALCON-Kabels vermelden. Wiederum drei Tage später fiel ein zwischen Katar und den Vereinigten Arabischen Emiraten (VAE) verlegtes Seekabel aus. Den Angaben zufolge wurde dieses etwa 200 Kilometer lange Kabel aber nicht durchtrennt. Vielmehr soll es Probleme mit der Stromversorgung gegeben haben. Wegen der Häufung der Vorfälle im arabischen Raum machten schnell Verschwörungstheorien die Runde. Beweise für Sabotagehandlungen konnten bislang aber nicht erbracht werden.

Die zum indischen Reliance-Communications-Konzern gehörende FLAG Telecom Group erklärte im Zuge der Reparaturarbeiten, für das Zerreißen des FALCON-Kabels sei ein vor der Küste Dubais ankerndes Schiff verantwortlich gewesen. Gefunden und geborgen wurde an der Unglücksstelle ein fünf bis sechs Tonnen schwerer Anker. Auch für die Beschädigungen des FEA- und des SEA-ME-WE-4-Kabels waren zunächst ankernde Schiffe verantwortlich gemacht worden. Die ägyptische Regierung erklärte später jedoch, in den zwölf Stunden vor und nach Bekanntwerden der Beschädigung vor Alexandria sei kein Schiff in der Nähe der Kabeltrassen gewesen. Dies hätten Untersuchungen, darunter Auswertungen von Videoaufnahmen, ergeben.

Gerissene Unterwasserkabel sind alles andere als selten. Nach Angaben von Global Marine Systems, einem der größten Dienstleister auf dem Gebiet der Seekabelverlegung und -reparatur, wurden allein im Atlantik im vergangenen Jahr mehr als 50 Kabel beschädigt. Das Unternehmen, das eigenen Angaben zufolge über die größte Flotte von Kabelverlegeschiffen und Unterwasserfahrzeugen verfügt, ist ständig auf allen Weltmeeren im Einsatz. In den Mittelpunkt des Interesses rückten die Vorfälle im Nahen Osten vor allem deshalb, weil davon insbesondere Indien betroffen war, dem Outsourcing-Weltmarktführer. Über die Europa-Asien-Kabel wird ein Großteil des Datenverkehrs von Indien in den atlantischen Raum transportiert.

Zusammengenommen haben die im Mittelmeer gerissenen, inzwischen aber wieder einsatzfähigen Kabel eine Kapazität von etwa 620 Gigabit pro Sekunde. Hinzu kommen mit dem älteren (nicht beschädigten) SEA-ME-WE-3-Kabel rund 70 Gbit/s.

But Telecom Egypt executive manager Mohammed el-Nawawi told the private TV network CBC that the reason for the region's slowdowns was not the alleged saboteurs — it was damage previously caused by a ship.

On March 22, cable provider Seacom reported a cut in its Mediterranean cable connecting Southern and Eastern Africa, the Middle East and Asia to Europe; it later suggested that the most likely cause of the incident was a ship anchor, and that traffic was being routed around the cut, through other providers.

But repairs to the cable took longer than expected, with the Seacom CEO announcing March 23 that the physical capability to connect additional capacity to services in Europe was ""neither adequate nor stable enough,"" and that it was competing with other providers.

The repairs continued through March 27, after faults were found on the restoration system; that same day, Seacom denied that the outage could have been the work of the Egyptian divers, but said that the true cause won't be known for weeks.

'We think it is unlikely that the damage to our system was caused by sabotage,' the CEO wrote in a statement.

India lost half its Internet capacity on Wednesday when two strands of fiber as thick as a thumb snapped. While service is returning to normal, it may be weeks before the cables are repaired. The fact that a pair of central Internet paths are just 2 km apart should serve as a cautionary tale as to just how fragile the Internet can be.

TeleGeography, a company that tracks cable capacity, said the two cables ""account for the majority of international communications capacity between Europe and the Middle East."" With both cables cut, capacity has been reduced by 75 percent to only 620 Gbps. The cables also carry a considerable amount of traffic bound for India and Pakistan.

The Internet is designed to deal with outages. Its protocols are inherently resilient and can circumvent regional outages by finding new routes, but it can take hours for routers to agree on new paths around a breakage. Even once those new paths are established, they may not be as fast. In this case, the severed links were two of the fastest in the region, and now some data has to travel via satellite or across the Pacific rim.

We contacted Sef Kloninger, senior director of service performance at Akamai, to find out just how slow links became. Kloninger told us that for a 9-hour period — from 4 a.m. GMT to 1 p.m. GMT on Jan. 30 — tests from four cities in India across regular Internet connections climbed from their usual 2 to 6 seconds’ response time to as high as 15 to 30 seconds, and that those sites were only available to Indian users 50 percent of the time.

Akamai offers a service called ""web application acceleration"" that makes dynamic applications more responsive than they would be across such links. Kloninger said that even Akamai’s customers were momentarily disconnected following the break, but that unlike regular Internet users the company’s optimized routing algorithms detected the problem immediately and routed around it within minutes. ""We saw most of the effect of routes into India, where connectivity was quite impacted,"" he said.

India-to-U.S. response time is returning to normal. But Egypt’s minister of telecommunications, Dr. Tarek Kamel, expects the fix to take up to two weeks, and inclement weather is already hampering repair crews.

The fact that these two cables — which are supposed to provide redundancy — were so close together should be cause for alarm. When companies build data centers, they go to great lengths to ensure that power supply into the data center comes from multiple directions in order to avoid interruptions. But geographic and technical constraints mean some places are particularly crowded, much like modern versions of the Suez and Panama canals. And with this concentration comes vulnerability.

The cut also serves as a reminder of our increasing reliance on global internetworking. Customer service and offshore development are the obvious victims. But the Internet is so much a part of our lives that everything from Skype calls to family wire transfers were affected.

In May, hackers showed they could bring down an entire country. Massive botnets like Storm can control millions of computers with hundreds of thousands active daily. And a couple of simple cuts can leave millions digitally stranded and bring industries to a halt. As we come to depend on the Internet for more and more, we need to take a much closer look at its weaknesses.

**Update:** The BBC is reporting that a third cable in the Middle East, known as Falcon, has been cut as well. The Falcon cable won’t compound the problems of the previous two breaks, as the older Sea-M-We 3 cable is the one now carrying the bulk of data that Wednesday’s break interrupted. But conspiracy theorists are sure to start speculating.

"Protecting the Submarine Cables That Wire Our World","Explores causes of submarine cable damage, with 70% attributed to ships' anchors; details major outages from incidents like the Alexandria fire affecting East Africa.","https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/a8773/protecting-the-submarine-cables-that-wire-our-world-15220942","2022-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","John Brandon",Yes,"John Brandon","Easton, Pennsylvania","63250","2022-06-22","English","Popular Mechanics","**On March 11, 2011, Andy Palmer-Felgate** was on his way to work in England when he first heard the news. A major earthquake and tsunami, and a subsequent nuclear meltdown, had hit Japan. As the country struggled to recover after Fukushima, he knew it was time for him to get to work on a problem that probably wasn't in the news.

Palmer-Felgate is a Verizon project manager who engineers and directs submarine-cable repairs all over the world, on about 80 cables leased or owned by Verizon. In the midst of the damage and devastation, the submarine cables lying along the ocean floor, which carried voice and Internet communications into and out of Japan, had also been severed.

After Fukushima, Palmer-Felgate helped direct the cable companies and engineers to pinpoint the location of the breaks by sending a pulse from a landing station on the coast and measuring the distance to the fault. His team piloted undersea remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) to find the broken links; the operators then located, lifted, and rejoined the cables. Then they sent ROVs to blast jets of water to make a new trench to bury the cable. It took several weeks to restore the country's full connectivity, he says.

""The Japan earthquake caused a whole series of underwater landslides,"" he says. ""At least seven of our cables were buried over by several kilometers of sediment.""

Today there are over 200 submarine cables buried in the ocean worldwide, creating the backbone of the 21st-century world economy. In 2013 wireless carriers and dedicated cable installation companies will lay another 12 lines to connect even more countries. (For example, the small island country of Tonga is getting one this year.) The longest cables, stretching thousands of miles under the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, run at fantastic speeds: The total bandwidth stretching under the Atlantic runs at an amazing 19 terabits per second.

The burning question: What happens when they break, and what can we do about it?

**Building Cables**

When you send an email, a small collection of bits containing your message travels from a local server to a high-speed fiber-optic cable. These fibers, strands of glass that carry a waveform of light, move data at speeds up to 100 Gbps. One undersea cable might have hundreds of wavelengths per strand and several fibers. A submarine cable is about 0.75 to 2.5 inches in diameter, or about the thickness of three ordinary garden hoses. The longest cable, called the Southern Cross, runs under the Pacific, stretching 18,500 miles.

Most cables take several weeks to install. Surveyors must work with local fisherman, carriers, survey teams, and a number of private companies to determine the best route along the ocean floor, avoiding deep caverns and potential hazards. It takes a day to lay 80 to 90 miles of cable. In shallower waters near the shore, where there's more to go wrong, operators lay just 8 to 9 miles of cable a day.

Palmer-Felgate says the first step is to dig a trench near the shore, usually about 3 to 9 feet deep, using a huge plow dragged behind a 100-to-200-foot cable ship. The ship feeds the cable into the trench just behind the plow; sediment falls over the cable to protect it. ROVs then fire jets of water to blow more sediment to fill over the newly installed cable. (In much deeper waters, where there is less risk to the cable, engineers lay it directly on the seabed.)

Andrew Blum, the author of the book Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet, says that with each new installation, the world becomes more connected. African countries such as Nigeria and Cameroon are the center of a lot of current construction. With data speeds approaching 100 Gbps per fiber-optic strand (10,000 times faster than a 10-Mbps line to your home or workplace), it's no wonder there is an ongoing effort to link the world by submarine cable.

**Breaks Happen**

Redundancy is another reason the seafloor cable-building craze continues. On Valentine's Day, according to Internet monitoring company Renesys, a fire in Alexandria, Egypt, severed six of the submarine cables on the coast. There was a widespread Internet outage in several East African countries, including Kenya.

""That was a reminder, when the Kenyan cable went down, that you really need two or three—that one [cable] is not enough to build an economy,"" Blum says. ""It made everyone nervous because the cables were too close together—there is a greater risk.""

Breaks occur most often when a ship drops anchor near a submarine cable, snags the cable, and ruptures it. (Ships use maps that show the cable lines, but sometimes ignore them or forget.) Anchors cause about 70 percent of all breaks, Palmer-Felgate says. Another 10 percent come from fishermen who are unaware they're dragging up more than just tuna. Natural disasters can also cause major breakages, such as what happened in Japan.

What hasn't happened yet, according to the firm TeleGeography, is a terrorist attack—though given their status as crucial infrastructure, the cables would be tempting targets. Blum says the cables are designed for redundancy, especially in areas like L.A. and New York City, where there might be 10 lines running into multiple landing stations.

""Cutting submarine cables is as hard as cutting off all air traffic to New York,"" Blum says. ""To cut off New York, you'd have to cut at least 10 cables. There is still a possibility to bring traffic in around Asia and Europe. You could isolate a place like Australia or a Pacific island. If you succeed in cutting five cables, you'd be perceived as cutting off the global economy. Unless you were fully successful, you'd have negligible impact."" Palmer-Felgate says companies like Verizon install multiple submarine cables and automatically reroute web traffic when a break occurs.

Although there have not been attacks, these cables are at the center of national security disputes. For example, the proposed $300 million trans-Atlantic Hibernian Express project is delayed because of rising cybersecurity tensions between China and the U.S.

**Diversify, Diversify, Diversify**

The real problem with undersea cables and infrastructure security is not that cables break and need to be repaired. Most of the experts said natural disasters will continue to break undersea cables and ships will drop anchor in the wrong places. Instead, Blum says, the real issue has to do with a lack of diversity on the Internet.

""There is no doubt [that] as more and more things connect to the Internet, everything becomes the Internet,"" Blum says. ""The best way to embrace the health and safety of the Internet is to embrace the 'inter'—to embrace this network of networks. The more networks there are, the more robust it is. The greatest risk is any single network getting too large. It is the Googles and the Verizons and the Comcasts that are the greatest risk to the Internet,"" he says, because having so few companies in control means you lose checks and balances.

The Internet should not be viewed as a single holistic thing. It is a place with great diversity, with many different ideas and people groups. The diversity is what ensures safety and redundancy, he says. The more a network spreads out, like a contagion that crosses geographic boundaries, the more powerful it becomes. That's ultimately the goal: more lines and more companies involved.

As for Palmer-Felgate, there is no question his team will keep repairing undersea cables. In the U.S. there might only be one fault per year, but in other countries, say, off the eastern coast of China in winter, there may be one cable break per week. In a world wrapped by 1000-mile fiber strands, breaks are a way of life.

""Engineers are constantly working to improve the armoring of cables, improve the routing of cables to avoid fault-prone areas, and bury cables more,"" says Alan Mauldin, a researcher at TeleGeography. ""I am not sure you can ever engineer something that is 100 percent reliable, but cables are very reliable if you consider the harsh environments in which they operate.","The article discusses various aspects of submarine cables, including specific incidents of cable damage, particularly in the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster, where multiple cables were severed.

It details the common causes of breaks, such as ships dropping anchors, which account for about 70% of all breaks.

The article also highlights the impact of cable disruptions on global connectivity, referencing a significant incident in Alexandria, Egypt, where a fire severed six submarine cables, leading to widespread Internet outages in East Africa.

Overall, it maintains a strong focus on the topic of cut sea cables, fulfilling the criterion."

The cables belonged to Telecom Egypt, Reuters said. It does not appear that the company has addressed the incident; at this point, it has only posted on its Facebook page a link to a news story about the capture of the divers.

The report comes several days after cable operator Seacom experienced an outage in Southern and Eastern Africa.

Seacom said in a Wednesday statement that its SW4 cable system ""suffered a cable cut off the coast of Egypt,"" prompting the service disruption, but ""all services on both SMW4 and IMEWE cable systems"" have since been restored.

In an updated statement this morning, Seacom said it had received multiple queries about the divers captured by Egyptian authorities. At this point, however, ""the investigation is in its early stages and nothing is as yet confirmed in regard to the cause of the damage to SMW-4.""

Still, Seacom said that sabotage is an unlikely reason for its recent outage, due to ""the specific location [of the affected cable], distance from shore, much greater depth, the presence of a large anchored vessel on the fault site which appears to be the cause of the damage, and other characteristics of the event.""

""The final cause of the cable cut will be determined once the cable is repaired in the coming weeks and the damaged section is recovered from the seabed and inspected,"" Seacom concluded.

Subsea fiber-optic cables, a critical information and telecommunications technology (ICT) infrastructure carrying more than 95 percent of international data, are becoming a highly consequential theater of great power competition between the United States, China, and other state actors such as Russia. The roughly 600 cables planned or currently operational worldwide, spanning approximately 1.2 million kilometers, are the world’s information superhighways and provide the high-bandwidth connections necessary to support the rise of cloud computing and integrated 5G networks, transmitting everything from streaming videos and financial transactions to diplomatic communications and essential intelligence. The demand for data center computing and storage resources is also expected to increase in the wake of the artificial intelligence revolution. Training large language models takes enormous, distributed storage to compute, and if those networks are globally oriented, they will require additional subsea capacity to connect them. These geopolitical and technological stakes necessitate a consideration of the vulnerabilities of subsea systems and the steps the United States can take to fortify the digital rails of the future and safeguard this critical infrastructure.

**Undersea Cables: Why Do They Matter?**

Subsea cables are critical for nearly all aspects of commerce and business connectivity. For example, one major international bank moves an average of $3.9 trillion through these cable systems every workday. Cables are the backbone of global telecommunications and the internet, given that user data (e.g., e-mail, cloud drives, and application data) are often stored in data centers around the world. This infrastructure effectively facilitates daily personal use of the internet and broader societal functions. In addition, sensitive government communications also rely extensively on subsea infrastructure. While these communications are encrypted, they still pass through commercial internet lines as data traverses subsea infrastructure. Subsea cables carry a much larger bandwidth and are more efficient, cost-effective, and reliable than satellites; consequently, they have been credited with increasing access to high-speed internet worldwide, fueling economic growth, boosting employment, enabling innovation, and lowering barriers to trade. These networks are now indispensable links for the modern world and are pivotal to global development and digital inclusivity.

**Cable Laying, Ownership, and Control**

Undersea cables are built, owned, operated, and maintained primarily by private sector companies. Approximately 98 percent of the world’s undersea cables are manufactured and installed by four private firms: in 2021, the U.S. company SubCom, French firm Alcatel Submarine Networks (ASN), and Japanese firm Nippon Electric Company (NEC) collectively held an 87 percent market share, with China’s HMN Technologies holding another 11 percent. Commercial undersea cables can be owned by a single company or a consortium of companies, including telecommunication providers, undersea cable companies, content providers, and cloud computing service providers. Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft now own or lease around half of all undersea bandwidth worldwide. The companies that build and own these cables often lease out bandwidth on their cables through indefeasible rights of use (IRUs), which grant long-term access to a portion of the cable’s capacity. IRU holders can also lease this bandwidth to other third parties, creating a layered leasing market that extends the cable’s reach and utility across various sectors and regions.

China’s rapid emergence as a leading subsea cable provider and owner has been the centerpiece of Beijing’s ambitious Digital Silk Road initiative launched in 2015, which aims to capture 60 percent of the global fiber-optic cable market by targeting emerging economies in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and the Pacific. While Chinese companies have been recently blocked from subsea cable projects involving U.S. investment and firms due to U.S. concerns about the national security risks that come with HMN Technologies’ unbridled growth, the company has provided 18 percent of the subsea cables (in terms of the total length of cable) that have been laid worldwide over the past four years. HMN Technologies has also become the world’s fastest-growing subsea cable builder over the past 10 years. A 2020 Federal Communications Commission (FCC) report referenced the fact that HMN Technologies has “built or repaired” almost 25 percent of subsea cables and is due to build only 7 percent of the cables currently under development globally, perhaps indicating a potential trend of the Chinese firm’s slowing control over international cable construction.

**The Vulnerability of Cable Systems and the Potential for Chinese Exploitation**

Undersea cables can be highly vulnerable to a variety of factors. Most cable damage is unintentional, mainly stemming from accidental human interaction with the cables. Still, potential hazards to the cables range from anchoring and fishing equipment to extreme weather such as earthquakes and landslides. Damage to submarine cables is relatively common—an estimated 100 to 150 cables are severed each year—mostly from fishing equipment or anchors.

The scale and exposure of undersea infrastructure also make it an easy target for saboteurs operating in the gray zone of “deniable attacks short of war.” In 2023, Taiwanese authorities accused two Chinese vessels in the area of cutting the only two submarine cables that supply internet to Taiwan’s Matsu Islands, plunging its 14,000 residents into digital isolation for six weeks. Although there was no clear confirmation of a deliberate attack, Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) pointed to a remarkable frequency of Chinese vessels causing cable disruptions—27 times since 2018—and accused Beijing of harassing Taiwan in a classic case of “gray-zone aggression.” Similarly, in October 2023, a Baltic Sea telecom cable connecting Sweden and Estonia sustained damage at the same time as a Finnish-Estonian gas pipeline and cable.

Subsea infrastructure's vital contribution to global business, and the emerging threats posed by damage and sabotage.

### Key insights

* Ninety-nine percent of the world's intercontinental internet traffic depends on undersea fiber-optic cables.
* Undersea cables and gas pipelines are vital enablers of business activities and energy security.
* The ""blue economy"" — the economic activities set in oceans and their shores — faces emerging threats due to a more challenging geopolitical landscape and the threat of sabotage.
* The consequences of damage to undersea assets can incur costs of billions of dollars, with the greatest risk occurring in areas that rely on a single subsea cable.
* New regulation is coming into place to address and respond to threats impacting vital infrastructure.

Undersea cables are hidden but increasingly vital enablers of the global economy that most people take for granted. Everyday business activities, such as sending emails, making video calls, transmitting data and transferring money, rely on the services provided by telecommunication cables that traverse the floors of the world's seas and oceans.

Along with gas pipelines and electricity connectors, subsea cables are a critical component of global infrastructure, powering global business and maintaining energy security.

Extensive development of new facilities is reinforcing the criticality of blue economy infrastructure, supporting the expansion of the digital economy and explosion of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). Among other things, subsea telecommunication cables are responsible for transmitting 99% of intercontinental internet traffic.

As business and society become ever more reliant on critical subsea infrastructure, it creates a growing source of vulnerability. Recent sabotage attempts on cables in the Red Sea and the Nord Stream gas pipeline explosion in Europe in 2022 are examples of an emerging geopolitical threat.

While it has yet to be formally announced, NATO is understood to be backing an initiative that will make it possible to reroute internet traffic from submarine cables to space in the event of an attack.

The Blue Economy continues to grow rapidly, fueled by the exponential growth of data in the digital age. Meanwhile, the transition to net zero and the ongoing drive to achieve energy security are driving the development of submarine energy cables.

A vast network of underwater infrastructure with thousands of miles of submarine cables, pipelines and other critical infrastructure is vital for the flow of data, energy and resources across country borders and between continents.

As well as channeling data, submarine cables enable the transmission of electricity generated from offshore wind farms, tidal energy facilities and other marine renewables, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and supporting the transition to net zero.

With an ever-increasing need for data storage and access and increasing pressures to move forward on the journey to net zero, the reliance on this critical yet vulnerable underwater infrastructure will continue to grow.

### Underwater infrastructure, the foundation of the Blue Economy, consists of:

### Undersea infrastructure powers innovation and growth

As the services the global digital economy provides continue to expand and interconnect, the infrastructure required to support this growth will also expand, contributing to economic development at multiple levels.

**Economic Impact of Subsea Cables' International Connectivity**

Many projects are already underway to further increase the existing network of global submarine cables. The explosion of AI is one factor behind such investment: Large language models require substantial data capabilities to stay operational, and subsea cables offer high bandwidths (upwards of 300-400 terabytes per second), with low lag time.

Meanwhile, global tech giants are in a race to set up data centers across the globe to support the growth in cloud services and cater to the growing demand for edge computing, Internet of Things and GenAI.

While the concept of underwater data centers is still in its infancy, it's likely to gain traction as one way of meeting future needs while reducing carbon and water footprints and boosting security.

All this demand means that businesses' profitability and capacity to innovate are going to become increasingly dependent on the effective operating of subsea infrastructure.

From an energy perspective, countries are transitioning away from fossil fuels, such as coal and gas, to renewable sources such as offshore wind and solar. The shift in energy mix brings more immediate challenges to the fore, including energy security and more volatile grid loads. This increases the importance of gas pipelines, subsea cables and interconnectors and their role in moving surplus gas and electricity from where it's produced to where it's needed.

The Greece-Egypt electrical interconnection (GREGY) is a 1,373-kilometer subsea electricity cable due to come online in 2029-2030 that will carry 3,000 megawatts of electricity, with the potential to power up to 450,000 households, from northern Egypt to Attica in Greece.

Subsea cables and interconnectors: The statistics

* The global submarine cable network stretches over 1.3 million kilometers and supports over USD10 trillion in economic activity annually.
* Across 66 developed countries, a 10% rise in broadband penetration could lift gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates by 1.2 percentage points.
* The market for submarine power cables is expected to grow to USD32.9 billion by 2032, driven by the need for efficient power transmission from renewable sources like offshore wind farms.
* The SEA-ME-WE 3 cable is currently the longest submarine fiber-optic cable in operation, spanning 24,233 miles, connecting Europe, the Middle East and India.

### Threats to undersea infrastructure

The importance of undersea cables and other infrastructure in the operation of the global economy means that any disruption to this infrastructure could have serious ramifications in terms of business functionality and profits.

""The rapid expansion of global connectivity is driving the need for an ever-increasing network of subsea cables,"" noted Adam Carrier, head of Consulting at AnotherDay, a Gallagher company. ""As our world becomes more interconnected and the demand for data continues to surge, a significant number of undersea cables are currently under development. In the places where the subsea cables are fewer in number, any damage to those cables can cause a massive setback to the country's economy.""

There are three key potential threat sources to consider: accidental damage, natural hazards and sabotage/cyber-attack.

#### Accidental damage

Reports suggest that more than 70% of cable faults stem from unintentional damage. Subsea cables can be inadvertently damaged in a number of ways: By fishing trawlers or ships dropping anchor, for example, or as a consequence of coastal development, port construction and dredging activities.

Damaged cables rely on specialized equipment and services to get them up and running again, but the global availability of such services is limited, which can cause delays and additional cost.

#### Natural hazards

Underwater infrastructure can also be exposed to natural disasters such as tsunamis and storms, even when laid beneath the seabed.

Submarine cable routes often cross tectonic plate boundaries. Earthquakes can trigger submarine landslides near the junction of tectonic plates, creating turbidity currents that flow over long distances, potentially breaking multiple cables in sequence.

#### Sabotage and cyber-attack

Despite being difficult to access, underwater cables and pipelines are relatively easy to locate, as companies make their whereabouts public to aid navigation and minimize accidents. This public information makes them vulnerable to sabotage.

Attacks on underwater cables are an increasing concern amid ongoing geopolitical tensions, with real potential to cause major damage and disruption. Meanwhile, the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in 2021 is a reminder of the growing cyber risk exposures faced by all critical infrastructure.

### The financial impact of damage to cable networks

Where an item of subsea infrastructure is not backed up by alternative routings, damage to an internet or energy pipeline can cause substantial disruption, resulting in internet outages or even energy blackouts.

Consequently, areas of the world that rely on a single subsea cable or a handful of interconnectors are most vulnerable to disruption.

When fiber-optic cables are damaged:

* Businesses may suffer financial losses due to disrupted operations, missed opportunities, and decreased productivity.
* Extended outages can harm a company's reputation and erode customer trust.
* Companies relying on global supply chains may face delays in shipments and communication with suppliers.
* Low internet connectivity can lead to downtime for online services, affecting customer experience and revenue.

In January 2022, an 827-kilometer fiber-optic cable connecting the South Pacific nation of Tonga to the rest of the world was damaged during the eruption of a volcano. It took a month to fully reconnect the island's population to the internet.","The article titled 'Hidden Dangers: Undersea Cables and Mitigating Economic Risk' discusses the critical importance of undersea cables for global connectivity and highlights the threats they face, including accidental damage and sabotage.

It states that over 70% of cable faults are due to unintentional damage and provides a specific example of a fiber-optic cable connecting Tonga that was damaged during a volcanic eruption.

This indicates a direct relevance to the topic of cut sea cables, as it treats the implications of such damage as a significant concern.

[Viet Nam News](https://vietnamnews.vn)

HÀ NỘI — The repair of a major internet submarine cable, SE-ME-WE 3 (SMW-3), has been delayed again, meaning Vietnamese internet users will see slower speeds for longer.

The cable, broken since mid-October, is located deep under the sea and its repair has been repeatedly delayed due to bad weather. Originally slated to be fixed by October 20, it is now expected to be repaired between December 21 to 26, according to the Việt Nam Posts and Telecommunication Group (VNPT).

After processing the SMW-3 submarine cable, the repair vessel will travel to fix the Asia American Gateway (AAG) cable, which broke down on November 7, not long after an earlier breakdown was repaired on October 22. Since AAG will be repaired only after SMW-3, the repair date for AAG has also been delayed from December 14-18 to sometime after December 26.

This is the fifth time AAG has faced problems this year. It’s one of several international internet cables that connect Việt Nam to the world.

The SMW-3 submarine cable was completed in late 2000. It has a system capacity of 320Gbps connecting Việt Nam with 39 countries and territories around the world. In Việt Nam, SMW-3 has a landing site in the central city of Đà Nẵng. It stretches across Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Western Europe.

The AAG cable, with a capacity reaching 2T/s, is one of the four intercontinental internet cable systems of Việt Nam. It is used by major local providers, namely FPT Telecom, VNPT, Viettel and SPT.

AAG was put into operation in November 2009 with a total length of 20,191 km and capacity reaching 2T/s, connecting countries in Southeast Asia to the United States. The system’s frequent breakdowns and problems have caused internet disconnections between Việt Nam and other countries. — VNS","The article titled 'Undersea internet cable repair delayed again' provides extensive coverage on the topic of cut sea cables.

But relatively high-tech techniques are not the only way to severely slow down the global Internet. As it turns out, you can achieve the same damage, and probably even more, with an axe.

On Wednesday, three Egyptian divers were arrested when they were trying to cut off a SeaMeWe 4 undersea cable, one of the main Internet wires that connects countries throughout Europe and Asia, as reported by Reuters. While their motives are still unknown (although we can see their faces, uploaded by the Egyptian navy on Facebook), their action might be linked to a series of disruptions and severed connections suffered by SEACOM, an African submarine cable operator, in the last few weeks.

SEACOM hasn't confirmed whether the previous disruptions have been caused by sabotage or perhaps just malfunctions or careless ships that inadvertently cut off cables. Whatever the case, this is not the first time that the region has suffered these types of cuts, similar incidents were reported in 2008 as well.

By cutting off an undersea cable like the one the three Egyptians were attempting to sever, you can basically completely switch off 1.28 terabits of data, four times as much data used in the Spamhaus attack. Taking out a cable like that would force the data to be re-routed through some of the other redundant cables than funnel Internet bits around the world. That can cause congestion and slowdowns.

Despite being the main provider for internet traffic connection, however, Telkom said its fiber optic failure did not completely cut internet services.

""We are still trying to identify what caused the connection failure,"" Telkom spokesperson Edy Kurnia told The Jakarta Post.

""We have sent a ship and a crew directly from Singapore to investigate.""

Edy said traffic capacity would be back to speed on Saturday after the Jakarta-Singapore connection was re-routed.

He said the re-route would use an alternative fiber optic connection, a satellite connection and digital radio transmissions.

The connection failure to Singapore happened amid already-disrupted Jakarta-Palembang fiber optic connections, which started Wednesday due to toll road construction in Palembang.

A re-routing of traffic would be temporary, Edy said.

The last time Indonesia's internet connection with the rest of the world was lost was in December 2006 when an earthquake off Taiwan measuring 7.2 on the Richter scale damaged undersea cables.

The damaged cables not only disrupted internet connections, but also telephone services across Asia after connections to main servers in the U.S. were severed.

Heru Sutadi, a member of the Indonesia Telecommunication Regulatory Body, said the undersea connection could have been disrupted by an earthquake or a failure of electronic machinery.

""It could be due to decaying machines or cables,"" he said.

Some of the fiber optics used for the Jakarta-Singapore connections were from the 1990s.

Heru said new companies as well as Telkom, PT Indosat and Excelcomindo were planning to invest in fiber optic connections, which would provide more alternatives for internet traffic and telephone connections.

Indonesian Internet Providers Association chairwoman Sylvia Sumarlin said a slowdown in connection speed was felt throughout the city but that no terminations occurred.

""Telecommunication operators and internet providers have learned from past experiences that they cannot rely solely on one route,"" she said.

""That is why when Telkom's connection is out, the backup connections automatically activate.""

To further secure connectivity to other internet hubs other than Singapore the development of the so called Palapa Ring Project must be accelerated.

The Palapa Ring is an ambitious project which aims to link Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, Nusa Tenggara, Sulawesi, Maluku and Papua and eight existing network connections or backhauls through an estimated total 35,280 kilometers undersea and 21,870 kilometers of underground fiber-optic cable.","The article discusses the failure of undersea fiber optic connections to Singapore, leading to a reduction in internet capacity for PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia.

But what if you could switch off 1.28 terabits—four times as much bandwidth—with nothing more high-tech than an axe?

That’s what three men tried to do in an unsophisticated but effective form of sabotage in Egypt yesterday; their identities and motives are not yet known. Reuters reports the Egyptian coastguard intercepted a fishing boat off the coast of Alexandria and arrested three men trying to cut through the SEA-ME-WE 4 undersea cable. The cable is one of the main connections between Asia and Europe, running from France to Malaysia and linking Italy, north Africa, the middle east and south Asia. The men, whose pictures the navy uploaded on Facebook, are being interrogated by Egyptian authorities.

The Internet does not live in anything resembling a cloud, as Andrew Blum memorably put it in Tubes, his book about the net’s physical infrastructure. Instead it resides in hundreds of cables snaking underground and along the bottom of the sea, where it is susceptible to ship anchors, marine life, and sabotage.

Most big countries have several redundant cables landing on their shores. But the loss of even a single one means that all the traffic must be jammed through remaining connections, causing congestion. And there is nothing to stop determined attackers from targeting several cables. Indeed, since many cables go through geographic chokepoints like the Suez, it wouldn’t be difficult to disrupt a whole bunch of connections in a brief period of time.

That’s exactly the kind of attack that seems to be underway. The past week saw reports of several severed cables off the coast of Egypt that are part of Seacom, a network of cables serving much of Africa. At the time, Seacom officials suspected careless ships. But the arrest of the three men yesterday suggests there could a concerted effort to take down Egypt’s connectivity. A similar spate of cuts affected the region in 2008, though no culprit was officially established.

Yesterday’s attacks on the Internet’s infrastructure—Cyberbunker and the Egyptian cable—show two ways of waging asymmetric war in the Internet era. If your aim is a single company, it helps to know how to wrangle thousands of zombie computers into a precise, targeted attack. That also has the benefit of allowing regular users—and the attackers themselves—to stay online. But if your target is bigger, say a country or a continent, all it takes to cripple the network is scuba gear and a few sharp-edged tools.","The article titled ""How To Take An Entire Continent Offline"" directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables by discussing an incident involving an attempted sabotage of the SEA-ME-WE 4 undersea cable.

Internet and telephone users in Asia will have to wait at least another week before systems hit by last month's earthquake are back to normal.

Work is getting under way on undersea telecommunications cables which were damaged by the quake off Taiwan.

A UK firm involved in the work said most repairs should be completed in a week to 10 days.

Traffic was switched away from the cables after the quake, but connections have been slower than normal.

The magnitude 7.1 earthquake on 26 December badly damaged some eight submarine optic fibre cables on the seafloor of the Bashi channel between Taiwan and the Philippines.

The cables serve Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, South Korea and Japan - all of whom suffered severe disruption to their internet and telephone networks.

UK-based Global Marine Systems is sending three of some six or seven ships that will work on retrieving the cables from the 4,000m deep sea bed and fixing them.

The firm's regional director, Ian Douglas, said the earthquake had caused an unprecedented level of damage to the cables.

""Twenty-one support cable faults occurred. That's more than we would expect to see across the whole of Asia in 12 months,"" he told the BBC News website.

He said the job would be extremely difficult as some cables had become trapped under the seabed or were tangled up.

""The very deep water is beyond the limits of the unmanned subs that we would normally have used,"" he said.

""Instead, we must use a kind of grappling hook - a rope with chains and hooks attached - that can be dragged along the sea bed to try and find the cable.""

He said, in some cases, up to 100km of cable may have been buried or damaged.

Despite the difficulties, Mr Douglas said that by next Monday ""we hope enough cables are restored so that there will not be the current degradation in internet speeds.""

He predicted it would take a week to 10 days to correct most of the faults.

Telecoms operators routed services through other means such as overland cables after the undersea cables were hit.

It's not just Egypt, either; other countries throughout the Middle East also suffered outages, with some being completely disconnected. And both India and Egypt, which run high-volume call centers, have taken a major hit in communications because of the disruption.

""Two of our cables are affected; everyone will go onto a third cable,"" ministry spokesperson Mohammed Taymur [told the AFP](http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080131/tc_afp/egyptinternet). ""But that will not be enough bandwidth. \[...\] People should know how to use the Internet because people who download music and films are going to affect businesses who have more important things to do.""

No one is exactly sure what happened to the two cables—the ministry says that they were more than two kilometers away from each other, and that ""\[t\]he break off may have occurred for natural or climatic reasons."" Officials hope to have solved the caper of the mysterious cable cutoff within a couple of weeks, the ministry said.

This isn't the first time such a thing has happened. Egypt's ministry says that Algeria, Taiwan, and India have all suffered similar incidents in recent years, although none were as high-profile. Last June, however, [some fishermen made headlines](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070608-phishing-plumbs-new-depths-vietnamese-fishermen-sever-fiber-optic-lines.html) by pulling up Vietnam's fiber optic lines in an attempt to salvage scrap copper from the ocean floor. Vietnam's own ministry later acknowledged that the fishermen—and even some officials—had a very ""simple understanding"" of the consequences of severing the cables.","The article titled 'Egypt says lay off music, movie downloads after 'Net outage' discusses the severing of two undersea cables that significantly impacted Egypt's internet connectivity, with 70% of the nation's internet being disconnected.

**Monday Update**: Over the weekend repair crews were dispatched for all three cables. Engineers arrived at the SEA-ME-WE3 and SEA-ME-WE4 cables on Sunday. India, Singapore, and about 80 percent of Egypt (according to the Egyptian government) regained internet service. Reliance said it expects the FLAG cable break to be repaired this week. The cause of the cuts remains unclear.

**Update**: Research firm TeleGeography emailed us that three international submarine cables in the Mediterranean Sea were damaged today, causing disruptions to internet and phone traffic in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, India and all of the Gulf states. TeleGeography pinpoints the faults between Tunisia and Italy, and claims the damaged cables are the FLAG Europe-Asia cable, operated by Reliance Globalcom, and two consortium cables, SeaMeWe-3 and SeaMeWe-4 owned jointly by several telecommunications companies. From the TeleGeography statement:

> The current series of faults is reminiscent of the submarine cable faults that occurred in January 2008. Today’s events have the potential to create worse disruptions: while the January 2008 accidents broke two of the three cables connecting Europe with Asia via the Middle East, Friday’s cable failures have caused faults on all three. France Telecom projects that service on all cables will be restored by December 31. Until then, many carriers in the Middle East and South Asia will need to route their European traffic around the globe, through South East Asia and across the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

It’s unknown if the Malta cable problems are related to these cuts, perhaps from a weather or seismic event. However in the online world the cuts are certainly related in how they will make it that much slower or impossible for users to connect around the world.

In a reminder of both the frailty and the flexibility of the web, the Times of Malta is reporting that last night, a submarine cable delivering traffic to subscribers of GO’s broadband service experienced a “fault.” Thousands of Maltese lost their web connections. Combine Malta’s experience with the earlier epidemic of a few undersea cables getting cut over a period of days, and a fight by Sprint and Cogent in the U.S. over peering agreements that cut off the web for some users, and it becomes clear that we should consider the web not only as physical infrastructure, but also held together by political and economic agreements.

It’s like an information superhighway, but also a like series of treaties that allow trade to various points of the globe. In Malta’s case, an agreement with Vodafone to share its cable kept the physical infrastructure from staying out. But as the Sprint/Cogent peering fight proved, when those agreements fail, the web is vulnerable in a way roads are not.","The article titled ""Optical Cable Cuts Disrupt Internet Service in India & the Middle East"" discusses significant disruptions caused by damage to three submarine cables: SEA-ME-WE3, SEA-ME-WE4, and the FLAG Europe-Asia cable.

When the world’s first transatlantic cable failed in 1858 – just three weeks after it had been inaugurated with a congratulatory telegram from Queen Victoria to US President James Buchanan – it took eight years until a replacement was operational. The cable, made of copper wires insulated with natural latex from the gutta-percha tree, probably had manufacturing faults and burnt out when its electric load was cranked up to compensate for rapidly deteriorating signal strength.  

When the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami devastated Eastern Japan on 11 March 2011, it killed more than 15,000 people and destroyed roads, bridges and nuclear reactors. It also damaged around half the transpacific cables connecting the country with the rest of the world. Within just a few days, ships had started lowering remotely operated vehicles (ROV) into the sea to repair the twisted and torn fibre optic cables.  

To repair fibre-optic cables at depths of 2,500m, the Kokusai Cable Ship Company Ltd (KCS), a Japanese cable installer, turned to the Marcas IV produced by a UK company, Soil Machine Dynamics. The company is a leading manufacturer of remote intervention equipment, operating in hazardous environments worldwide.  

With a particular focus on subsea engineering, SMD has become a major designer and manufacturer of specialist subsea ROVs worldwide. Marcas IV, and similar high-tech ROVs, have ‘multifunctional capabilities – where one asset can do multiple tasks, working with soft ground and hard ground cables,’ says Graeme Walker, SMD’s sales manager.  

In May, Global Marine Systems (GMS), a global supplier of submarine cable installation, maintenance and repair services, launched the DXr1 camera – an x-ray camera to monitor the quality of repairs of a cable joint. Its outstanding feature is that it uses digital imaging technology in place of traditional film. The camera allows a real-time review, so that it is possible to ‘make sure, right there on the ship, whether the cable is connected properly,’ says Anne Dellos LeBoutillier of GMS.  

Also reducing repair time is new technology to locate and retrieve broken cable ends, for example with new grapnel hook technology that makes it possible to grab and cut cable ends simultaneously. This reduces repair time by a day or more, says Andy Palmer-Felgate, project manager in charge of cable repairs at US telecoms giant Verizon, a company that owns or leases more than 80 cables worldwide.

HÀ NỘI — Three out of four internet submarine cables linked to Việt Nam broke down on Monday, slowing down internet speed nationwide.

Viettel, one of the largest Vietnamese internet providers, confirmed the incident, saying international undersea cables AAG and Inter-Asia (IA) had developed problems in the Hong Kong sea area. AAG was down at two spots, some 66km and 85km away from the cable station in Hong Kong.

The IA cable line snapped at a location some 54km from its Hong Kong’s cable station.

The exact place where the SMW3 cable line broke down, however, is yet to be located.

Internet providers in Việt Nam failed to provide an explanation as to why all three internet cables were down at the same time and were unclear about the timeline of when the cables would be fixed.

The providers said that they would have to rely more on land cables for internet in the mean time, however, those were unlikely to meet usage demand.

The AAG line is one of the longest submarine cables in the world, stretching more than 20,000km across the Pacific Ocean to link Southeast Asia with the United States. The line accounts for up to 60 per cent of the internet connection between Việt Nam and the rest of the world.

The IA cable is some 6,800km long and connects five Asian countries and territories – Việt Nam, Singapore, the Philippines, Japan and Hong Kong.

This is the third time AAG and IA have faced problems this year.

The other broken line, SMW3, connects the three regions of East Asia, the Middle East and Western Europe with total length of 39,000km.

In one of the more ‘hands on’ examples of cyber-espionage we’ve seen in a while, Egypt’s military has reported that it’s managed to arrest three scuba divers in the process of trying to sever an undersea cable that connects the country to the World Wide Web.  
  
Speaking on the Egyptian armed forces Facebook page, Colonel Ahmed Mohammed Ali, said that a navy patrol vessel caught the three men red-handed as they were working from an inflatable dinghy, attempting to cut through the undersea cable, just north of the port city Alexandria. The claim was later verified by Telecom Egypt, the country’s largest telecommunications firm, on its official Twitter feed, and reported by several major news outlets.  
  
The incident might help to explain the patchy internet speeds reported in Egypt and neighboring countries since last Wednesday. GigaOM’s Om Malik wrote a blog yesterday explaining how the undersea cable known as “South East Asia Middle East Western Europe 4” (SEA-ME-WE 4) suffered damage just last week. It occurred at a most unfortunate moment, when two other major cables were in ‘maintenance mode’. This resulted in disruption for internet service providers across Egypt and other countries in the Indian Ocean region, with India, Pakistan, South Africa, and Kenya all reporting problems. At the time, telecoms companies blamed the damage on a “shipping accident”, but in light of yesterday’s discovery, the possibility that the earlier cut was also sabotage cannot be ruled out.  
  
Of course this begs the question – why on earth would anyone want to sabotage Egypt’s internet connection? There are certainly plenty of people around with a grudge against the country and its leaders, including political opponents of the Morsi government, Israel and Syria to name just a few, but it isn’t immediately clear what these could achieve by disconnecting the country’s internet access.  
  
Egypt’s military hasn’t yet given any details on the men arrested nor any clues as to their motivation. As of now, the men are still being interrogated.  
  
The good news at least is that internet services in Egypt are expected to be fully restored within the next 20 hours, according to Communications Minister Atef Helmy in an interview with Turkish agency Anadolu.","The article titled 'Egypt Arrests Divers ""Trying To Sabotage Undersea Cables""' directly discusses the attempted sabotage of an undersea cable in Egypt, which is a clear reference to the topic of cut sea cables.

According to reports, the internet blackout, which has left 75 million people with only limited access, was caused by a ship that tried to moor off the coast of Egypt in bad weather on Wednesday. Since then phone and internet traffic has been severely reduced across a huge swath of the region, slashed by as much as 70% in countries including India, Egypt, and Dubai.  

“It will depend on how bad the damage is, but they’ll find the sections in question and bring them up onto a ship for repair before sinking them again,” said Mauldin. “It could take a week or possibly two weeks.”  

The fibre optic wires in question – called Flag Europe-Asia and Sea-Me-We 4 – are some of the most vital information pipelines between Europe and the east. The latter, which runs in an uninterrupted line from western Europe to Singapore, had only recently been opened after a mammoth £500m, three-year installation project. Between them, the two lines are responsible for around 75% of all connectivity in the Middle East and south Asia.  

“The problems are really at pinch points where increasingly huge amounts of information are coming through,” said Jim Kinsella, chairman of Interoute, Europe’s largest fibre optic network provider. He said that improvements are scheduled for submarine cabling, but that plans to send more internet traffic over land connections rather than under the sea had been set back by political wrangling.  

Renesys, a network Monitoring provider, has been posting analysis of the impact country-by-country. These systems provided much of the capacity into the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent from the west. Although some countries were hurt more than others, the loss of connectivity was extensive and very widespread. Some countries and a few providers were almost completely knocked off the Internet. As Day 1 came to a close, it was clear that the damaged cables were not going to be repaired anytime soon and the impacted parties would have to look for alternatives to waiting it out.  

Day 2 and 3 saw a frenzy of activity as local providers in the region tried to broker agreements with anyone who still had capacity. They were under intense pressure to restore service to local governments and businesses. In turn, global and regional providers with surviving capacity into the region were busy hunting for new customers. We definitely had a seller’s market.

The cable systems in question are the Intra-Asia (IA), South-East Asia - Middle East - Western Europe 3 (SMW-3) and Asia America Gateway (AAG).

Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group (VNPT), one of three major Internet service providers in Vietnam alongside FPT Telecom and Viettel, said it was looking into the problem with the AAG system as well as considering contingencies.

As of Monday morning, local providers were yet to say conclusively the nature of the problems with these cables or announce a maintenance schedule.

There is speculation that the submarine system was ruptured by consecutive tropical storms in the East Vietnam Sea over the past few weeks.

According to FPT Telecom, the SMW-3 cable system was connected to Vietnam on September 1999 and completed in late 2000.

It is led by France Telecom and China Telecom, and is administered by Singtel, a telecommunications operator owned by the government of Singapore.

The 39,000-kilometer system is the longest in the world, connecting Vietnam and 39 other countries through the landing point in central Da Nang City.

Meanwhile, the AAG is a 20,000-km submarine communications cable system connecting Southeast Asia with the U.S. mainland across the Pacific Ocean via Guam and Hawaii.

The US$560 million submarine system strikes land in Vietnam in Vung Tau City in the south, delivering up to two terabits per second.

The IA cable system was inaugurated on November 2009 with a total length of 6,800 km, linking Internet users in Vietnam, Singapore, the Philippines, Hong Kong and Japan.

The $200 million cable also makes its landing point in Vung Tau, capable of delivering up to 3.84 Tbit/s.

All major providers in Vietnam confirmed that they had backup plans in place to maintain uninterrupted international connectivity in the event of problems with any of the cables.

In late 2016, the Asia Pacific Gateway (APG) was completed with the highest Internet traffic capacity in Asia.

It was expected to offer Internet users in Vietnam a more reliable connection than the infamous AAG system, which has suffered repeated ruptures over the past few years.

Since July, VNPT and Viettel have been operating on the Asia Africa Europe 1 (AAE-1) cable system as well.

The communications system links 19 countries in Asia, the Middle East and Africa, and cost $820 million to develop.","The article titled 'Three of Vietnam’s major submarine Internet cables report problems' discusses problems reported with three submarine communications cables crucial to Vietnam's international connectivity.

When a Taiwanese telecoms company detected that an international undersea cable was damaged earlier this month, it worked to divert internet traffic from the broken line to keep customers on the island connected.

But the company, Chunghwa Telecom, also went to Taiwan’s Coast Guard to report the incident – and a “suspicious vessel” observed on the same route as the affected cable, according to a statement from the company, a major local internet provider.

Taiwan Coast Guard officials in the days since have said they suspect that the Shunxin39 – a Chinese-linked cargo vessel – could have cut the cable, in an incident that has spotlighted the island’s growing concerns about vulnerabilities that could be exploited by Beijing.

Taiwan officials have not cited direct evidence that the ship damaged the cable, and the Taiwan Coast Guard said in a statement Monday that it could not determine the vessel’s intentions. It called for South Korea, the ship’s destination, to help with further investigation.

But the situation has raised concerns among Taiwanese authorities of potential “gray zone operations,” or acts that fall below the threshold of war – in particular those that could hamper the island’s internet and communications with the outside world.

Those concerns come as Taiwan has faced increasing intimidation from Beijing, which claims the self-ruled democracy as its own territory and has vowed to take control of it, by force if necessary.

They also follow a string of incidents in recent years of damage to undersea infrastructure worldwide, including communications cables. Two high-profile incidents in the Baltic Sea involved Chinese ships and remain under investigation.

Taiwan’s Coast Guard said in a statement Monday that the ship suspected of damaging the cable off its northeastern coast last Friday was a Cameroon- and Tanzania-flagged vessel, crewed by seven Chinese nationals.

The vessel is owned by Hong Kong company Jie Yang Trading Limited, which is directed by a Chinese national, a senior Coast Guard official confirmed separately to CNN. While there was no direct evidence the vessel sabotaged the submarine cable, radar showed the vessel passed by when the cable was cut, the official said.

“As of now we cannot ascertain its real intentions, but based on what we see so far, we won’t rule out the possibility of China destroying the cable through ‘gray zone operations,’” the senior official told CNN.

Such an act could be part of Beijing-backed efforts to use “ships with flags of convenience to cut Taiwan’s international communication as a form of preparation for future blockade and quarantine,” according to the official.

Beijing’s Taiwan Affairs Office said on Wednesday that submarine cable damage is a “common maritime incident,” and balked at Taipei’s “conjecturing” and “deliberate framing of gray zone threats.”

Two independent analysts told CNN that tracking data on the Shunxin39 showed atypical behavior for a cargo vessel, describing a meandering or erratic path. The ship was also found to be using two different positioning system numbers, according to the Taiwan Coast Guard, which is also seen by experts as unusual for standard cargo operations.

Chinese national Guo Wenjie, director of the company operating the vessel, denied in a statement to news agency Reuters on Wednesday that the ship was responsible for the damage.

“There’s no evidence at all,” he told Reuters by telephone. “I spoke to the ship captain and for us it was a normal trip.” CNN was unable to independently reach Guo, but public records list him as the sole shareholder of Jie Yang Trading Limited.

In 2023, Taiwanese authorities blamed two Chinese ships for damaging two submarine internet cables linked to Taiwan’s outlying island of Matsu in incidents days apart causing an internet blackout, but stopped short of saying they were deliberate acts.

Su Tzu-yun, a military expert at Taiwan’s Institute for National Defense and Security Research, said more evidence is needed to say whether the latest incident was intentional.

But he said Taiwan needs to bolster maritime surveillance and defense of submarine cables.

“Once submarine cables are sabotaged, Taiwan’s connectivity to the international community will be severed; we can then only rely on bandwidth provided by satellites, which would then affect our digital economy, international trade and banking,” he said, calling such potential sabotage a form of “psychological warfare.”

Other observers have suggested the recent incident could be part of a trial of such tactics.

“While it doesn’t look to me like part of an effort to seriously impede Taiwan’s connectivity with the world … it could be consistent with either a campaign to apply low-level harassment, or as a test run for something that could be done at a larger scale at a later date in conjunction with other coercive operations,” said Tom Shugart, a retired US Navy captain and adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security think tank in Washington.

Taiwan has seen a surge of Chinese military activities in the Taiwan Strait and the Western Pacific in recent months, in line with a ramping up of intimidation over the past few years. Chinese naval and coast guard vessels have plied regional waters, and there has been an increase in Chinese aircraft operating around the island.

But Taiwan officials and defense experts have increasingly focused on the potential for Beijing to use gray zone tactics and non-military actors like China Coast Guard and various police and maritime safety agencies – as well as a so-called maritime militia of civilian ships – to quarantine the island or play a role in a blockade if it wanted to move to take control.

In a first-of-its kind “tabletop” exercise simulating military escalations by China late last month, multiple government agencies were tasked with responding to a broader base of threats than an armed invasion, including information warfare.

One official highlighted then how government agencies struggled to clarify falsehoods during electricity or internet outages, highlighting the need for Taiwan to have a backup mechanism to ensure the flow of information.

Taiwan’s Ministry of Digital Affairs earlier this week said it has been working on initiatives aimed at strengthening Taiwan’s communications by exploring alternative internet options including low-Earth-orbit satellites and adding new submarine cable stations.

Last month, Taiwan’s tech tzar Wu Cheng-wen told reporters in a briefing that in addition to working with LEO satellite company OneWeb, the island is also in talks with Amazon’s Project Kuiper for satellite collaborations.

Those efforts may only appear more urgent to observers amid a spate of incidents where Chinese and Russian vessels have come under scrutiny.

Swedish police have sought to investigate the Chinese bulk carrier Yi Peng 3 in relation to its possible role in the breach of two undersea fiber-optic cables in the Baltic Sea in November. The incident had echoes of a 2023 case in which Chinese ship NewNew Polar Bear was suspected of damaging undersea cables as well as a gas pipeline in the Baltic.

Finnish investigators late last month seized a tanker carrying Russian oil and said they suspected the vessel had damaged the Finnish-Estonian Estlink 2 power line and several internet cables by dragging its anchor across the seabed.

Damage to submarine cables in the Red Sea last March disrupted telecoms networks in the region weeks after the official Yemeni government warned of the possibility that Houthi rebels would target the cables, though the group denied involvement.

While damage to cables is not rare and is often seen as accidental, analysts warn that the recent cases also underscore vulnerabilities.

Shugart of CNAS said that there does seem to be a number of breakages recently that seem to have been deliberate, including those done “by or for Russian or Chinese interests.”

“This is going to be a quite challenging issue to police, as most of these cables run through international waters where traditional international law allows enforcement only in very narrow areas.”","The article titled 'A cut undersea internet cable is making Taiwan worried about ‘gray zone’ tactics from Beijing' directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables.

"Impact of Dragged Anchors on Submarine Cables","30% of submarine cable incidents caused by dragged anchors, resulting in about 60 faults each year.","https://www.iscpc.org/publications/icpc-viewpoints/damage-to-submarine-cables-from-dragged-anchors","2025-02-24T12:00:00.000Z","",Yes,-,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom","165850","2025-02-24","English","International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC)","### Damage to Submarine Cables from Dragged Anchors

**Impact of Anchor Damage on Submarine Cables**

Damage to submarine cables from dragged anchors account for approximately 30% of incidents each year representing around 60 faults. Damage to these cables is costly, with telecommunication repairs averaging £500k-£1m per incident and power cable repair costs reported to be in the region of £10m-£100m per incident depending on many variables. Downtime from cable damage has the potential to cause disruption to global communications and energy transmission and distribution.

**Anchors: A Leading Cause of Cable Damage**

An ICPC White Paper published in 2011 demonstrated through use of AIS monitoring that anchors were a far more significant cause of damage than had previously been thought, where more incidents of damage had been attributed to fishing each year. This represented a marked increase in anchor-related incidents compared to earlier data. One of the most significant anchor drag events in recent history occurred off Sicily in 2008, where a ship dragged its anchor for 300 km, damaging six submarine cables.

**Accidental Anchor Deployment**

Accidental deployment of an anchor, without the crew’s knowledge, remains rare but can be possible due to the following factors: Anchors must be fully secured before departure using multiple securing mechanisms. Poor upkeep of anchor securing equipment increases the likelihood of accidental release.

**Recommendations for Mitigating Anchor Damage**

1. Improved Vessel Practices
2. Insurance
3. International Maritime Organisation – call to action
4. Legal and Regulatory Framework

**Conclusion**

Anchors dragged by vessels, especially those underway, present a significant and preventable threat to submarine cables. By enforcing stricter operational standards, leveraging technology, and enhancing crew training, the maritime community can significantly reduce the risk of damage to this critical global infrastructure.","The article titled 'Damage to Submarine Cables from Dragged Anchors' discusses the significant threat that dragged anchors pose to submarine cables, which are critical for global communications and energy networks.

The fault has caused severe problems in Benin, Togo, Niger and Nigeria. The blackout is thought to have been caused by damage to the SAT-3 cable which runs from Portugal and Spain to South Africa, via West Africa. Around 70% of Nigeria's bandwidth was cut, causing severe problems for its banking sector, government and mobile phone networks.

""SAT-3 is currently the only fibre optic cable serving West Africa,"" explained Ladi Okuneye, chief marketing officer of Suburban Telecom, which provides the majority of Nigeria's bandwidth. ""So all West African countries have to use it.""

Companies were being forced to use alternatives - such as using satellite links - to maintain connections to the rest of the world, he said. Telkom South Africa, one of the shareholders of SAT-3, has not said what caused the problems but said it was aware of ""a cable fault on the Benin branch that is being investigated"".

The 15,000km (9,300mile) SAT-3 cable lands in eight West African countries as it winds its way between Europe and South Africa. ""The rest of the system is unaffected by this fault,"" a Telkom South Africa representative said.

Nigeria has been badly hit because around 70% of its bandwidth is routed through neighbouring Benin. The network, run by Suburban Telecom, was set up to bypass Nigeria's principal telecoms operator Nitel which runs the SAT-3 branch cable which lands in Nigeria.

The SAT-3 consortium is in the process of sending a ship from Cape Town in South Africa to the area to investigate the fault. Mr Okuneye said that by the time the relevant paperwork was done, it was likely to be ""two weeks"" before the ship arrived off the coast.

Meanwhile, Benin has been able to reroute its net traffic through neighbouring countries to get back online. Mr Okuneye said his company was hoping to do the same but said the process would be slower because its bandwidth requirements were so much larger than those of the small republic.

Taiwan’s coast guard detained a cargo ship and its Chinese crew on Tuesday and said it was investigating whether the vessel had deliberately cut an undersea internet cable, in the latest possible breach of the island’s communication lines.  

The vessel suspected of damaging the cable connecting Taiwan to its outlying Penghu Islands carried a “flag of convenience” and was crewed by eight Chinese nationals, Taiwan’s coast guard said in [a statement](https://www.cga.gov.tw/GipOpen/wSite/ct?xItem=164475&ctNode=650&mp=999).  

A “flag of convenience” vessel is one that flies the flag of a country other than the country of ownership.  

The ship “Hong Tai,” registered in the West African nation of Togo with Chinese funding, had been lingering near the cable in waters off the southwestern coast of Taiwan since Saturday evening and did not respond to multiple broadcasts from Taiwan’s coast guard, the statement added.  

Shortly after the ship dropped anchor in the early hours of Tuesday, Taiwan’s telecom company Chunghwa Telecom detected that the cable had been disconnected.  

The coast guard said it intercepted and boarded the vessel, before escorting it back to a port in the city of Tainan for investigation.  

Taiwanese authorities said they could not rule out the possibility of a Chinese “gray zone operation,” a coercive or subversive act that falls below the threshold of war.  

“Whether it was an intentional act of sabotage or purely an accident needs to be further probed,” the coast guard said in the statement, adding that the matter is now under investigations by prosecutors “in accordance with national security-level guidance.”  

In recent years, multiple undersea telecoms cables around Taiwan have suffered suspicious damage.  

In January, Taiwanese authorities said a Chinese-linked cargo vessel could have [cut an international undersea cable](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/09/china/undersea-cable-taiwan-intl-hnk/index.html) off the island’s northern coast.  

In 2023, Taiwan officials blamed Chinese ships for two incidents in which cables connecting Taiwan’s main island to its outlying islands of Matsu were damaged, causing an internet blackout. They stopped short of saying the acts were deliberate.  

The incidents have raised concerns among Taiwan authorities of “gray zone” activities that could hamper the island’s internet and communications with the outside world.  

Those concerns come as Taiwan has faced [increasing intimidation](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/09/asia/china-military-movement-taiwan-lai-trip-intl-hnk/index.html) from Beijing, which claims the self-ruled democracy as its own territory and has vowed to take control of it, by force if necessary.  

They also follow a string of incidents in recent years of damage to undersea infrastructure worldwide, including communications cables. Two high-profile incidents in the Baltic Sea involved Chinese ships and remain under investigation.  

According to NATO chief Mark Rutte, more than 95% of internet traffic globally is carried via undersea cables, with some 1.3 million kilometers of such cabling securing an estimated $10 trillion dollars of international trade daily.","The article discusses a significant incident involving a Chinese-linked cargo ship that is suspected of intentionally cutting an undersea internet cable off the coast of Taiwan.

This is the fifth time that the infamous AAG has been disconnected this year.

Internet connections along a major undersea cable system linking Vietnam with the rest of the world were disrupted on Tuesday, according to a local internet service provider (ISP).

The hiccup, which occurred at the section connecting Ho Chi Minh City with the main cable system, is likely to slow down internet speed in Vietnam.

The cause of the problem has yet to be identified, and no repair schedule has been announced.

Vietnam's ISPs said they have switched to their backup plans to ensure stable internet connections for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit.

This is the fifth time the AAG has been ruptured this year, following incidents in January, February, August and October. Repair works to the infamous cable system's problem in October were finished just over two weeks ago.

Connected in November 2009, the $560-million AAG with a capacity of 2 terabits per second handles more than 60 percent of the country’s international internet traffic.

With a length of over 20,000 kilometers (12,420 miles), the cable connects Southeast Asia and the U.S., passing through Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Brunei, Hong Kong and the Philippines.

Vietnam currently has six submarine cable systems, as well as a 120 gigabit channel that runs overland through China.

With a download speed of 5.46 megabytes per second, Vietnam's internet speed was ranked 74th out of 189 countries and territories in a global survey of broadband speeds compiled by Cable.co.uk, a U.K. broadband, TV, phone and mobile provider, in August.

Vietnam's average broadband speed was 10 times lower than its Southeast Asian neighbor Singapore, according to the survey. However, the country still managed to trump six other countries in the region.

An ageing submarine cable that links Australia to Southeast Asia was cut for the third time this year, underscoring the urgent need for a more robust connection to support the region’s growing internet traffic.

According to reports, the nearly 20-year-old SEA-ME-WE3 subsea cable that connects up Perth in Western Australia to Singapore and onwards to other landing points in Europe, the Middle East and Asia was cut in the early hours of 3 December 2017.

The cable fault occurred approximately 1,126 km from the cable landing station in Singapore. Until the link is restored, internet users in Australia can expect to see increased latency to Asian destinations.

The latest damage follows a series of cuts – typically caused by ship anchors, storms and earthquakes in the region – to the same cable in recent years, including an outage in August 2017 when its insulation near Hong Kong was damaged.

“These faults can be tricky to fix and, as a cable system ages, become more prominent,” said Luke Mackinnon, head of Australian network service provider Vocus International.

Vocus is in the midst of building the Australia Singapore Cable, a 4,600 km submarine cable system linking Perth to Singapore via Jakarta in Indonesia. Vocus is expected to lay the cable in early 2018 between Singapore and Christmas Island.

“Later this month, the components will be loaded on a ship and brought to Singapore. We expect it to arrive in January. At this point we will offload a third of the cable and repeaters at Singapore. The cable laying ship will pick them up in January and start laying in February,” Mackinnon said.

Apart from Vocus, a high-powered regional consortium comprising Google, Australian research network AARNet, telcos Indosat Ooredoo, Singtel and Telstra, and SubPartners is building the 9,000 km Indigo subsea cable that will link Singapore with Perth, and onwards to Sydney.

With landing stations in Singapore, Australia and Indonesia, Indigo – to be constructed by Alcatel Submarine Networks – will also allow connections between Singapore and Jakarta.

David Burns, Telstra’s group managing director of global services and international, said with internet data consumption growing by 70% in Asia in 2016, investments such as Indigo are critical for meeting the connectivity needs of consumers and businesses.

“This will be an important piece of technology infrastructure connecting Southeast Asia and Australia, and follows a number of recent network enhancements Telstra has undertaken to meet growing demand for data and better connectivity from our customers across the Asia-Pacific region,” he said.

Transmitting about 99% of the world’s telecommunications, submarine cables have emerged as critical infrastructure necessary for systems to function. In recent months, there have been two “extraordinary” outages that have brought submarine cable damage and protection issues to the fore.

Three cables in the Red Sea were severed by an anchor drag followed by the West African subsea cable outage where four cable systems were damaged by an undersea canyon avalanche incident. While these incidents led to widespread connectivity disruption, they also demonstrated the need for robust redundancy measures to manage outages.

A key question that arises out of these incidents of submarine cable damage is whether cable owners have legal recourse to claim losses, including consequential losses. In this article, we attempt to unpack some knotty legal issues regarding submarine cable damage claims and remedies.

**Protection of submarine cables**

The first submarine cable laid across the English Channel between Dover and Calais in 1850 was reportedly put out of action almost immediately by a fisherman who hooked the line near shore and cut out a section as a souvenir. Over the past 175 years, as telecommunications technology has advanced, the number of subsea cable systems has surged, accompanied by an increase in damage risks.

The causes of submarine cable damage include natural hazards, as in the case of the West African subsea landslide, as well as man-made activities ranging from fishing, undersea mining, oil and gas activities, and dredging – the cause of the outage in the Red Sea. Increasingly, deliberate actions by state and non-state actors also pose a threat to cable systems; early reporting around the Red Sea outage incorrectly posited that violent activity from the Houthi rebel group could have damaged the cables in question.

Given the critical nature of submarine cables, it is surprising that their protection under international law is limited and in parts antiquated. There are two key treaties protecting submarine cables:

* The 1884 Convention for the Protection of Submarine Telegraph Cables (“**Paris Convention**”) criminsalises “_breaking or injuring a submarine cable, wilfully or by culpable negligence, in such manner as might interrupt or obstruct telegraphic communication, either wholly or partially, such punishment being without prejudice to any civil action for damages._” However, many state parties have failed to translate the Paris Convention’s requirements into their criminal law.
* _or injury caused by persons who acted merely with the legitimate object of saving their lives or their ships, after having taken all necessary precautions to avoid such break or injury._”

While both the Paris Convention and the UNCLOS require States to criminalise conduct of private parties leading to submarine cable damage, there is no express prohibition in international law preventing States from deliberately damaging submarine cables - such as for undersea warfare. The need to address this is urgent; early reporting that the Houthi rebels were responsible for the Red Sea cable outage proved inaccurate, but era of subsea warfare is upon us. Naval News notes that Russia has invested heavily in offensive seabed warfare capabilities, and that Hamas has built UUVs (uncrewed underwater vehicles) to target Israeli offshore natural gas infrastructure – the threat is real.

**Potential claims and remedies by cable owners**

If damage is incurred by submarine cables, their owners can be entitled to various claims or remedies depending on several factors. These include where the damage occurs, as this varies depending on if the cable is located in the high seas, an exclusive economic zone, a continental shelf, or territorial waters. Whether the damage was caused by a natural event or human activity is of course another factor, as well as the intent behind the damage – whether it was deliberate or negligent.

The law is clearer if the damage occurs within territorial waters (within 12 nautical miles from the coast) – in such instances, national courts can exercise ordinary admiralty jurisdiction. However, damage that occurs in the high seas or a continental shelf can be subject to different legislation depending on national laws – state courts may not have jurisdiction in such instances.

If damage is caused by human activity, cable owners can potentially seek damages from the wrongdoer but must consider general principles of damage in tort (criminal wrongdoing) law – for example, to recover any damages, the damage itself must be reasonably foreseeable – and limitations of liability under maritime law.

Any liability claim would ultimately depend on the circumstances. For example, if a wrongdoer caused damage after noticing the position of a cable – and if the damage caused monetary losses for repairs or similar – then they would be in breach of a duty of care to the cable provider. A good illustration of such a claim would be the Canadian case of _The Realice_ where the vessel’s captain snagged a fibreoptic cable in his anchors. Believing – based on having glimpsed a map of active cables years before – that the cable was inactive, he cut it and was found liable for USD 1 million in damages.

**Potential claims against cable owners**

Given the role that subsea cables play in global connectivity, there are many players in the value chain who will be affected by any cable damage. For instance, an internet service provider might seek to recoup damages for internet outage arising from a damaged cable. To ensure that cable owners are protected by such claims, it is important to review contracts with third parties to ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place to manage liability.

Limitation of liability provisions are standard in contracts between mobile service providers and customers. In contracts between cable owners and users of cable services, it is important to specify the forum to resolve disputes and the law applicable to the dispute. in instances of naturally occurring damage as in the case of the East African subsea landslide, there should be workable force majeure provisions that exclude liability of the cable owners.

**Managing liability: the way forward**

Telecommunications companies might consider investing in monitoring equipment for submarine cables and to ensuring the development of backup and redundant cable systems. Another key exercise for private players is to review their contracts and ensure that they have robust protections in case of cable failure (for instance, carving out consequential losses and including workable force majeure clauses in contracts). Finally, cable systems owners and operators must ensure forensic data collection in instances of cable damage in support of any claims.

In the international sphere, states need to come together to formulate a clear and comprehensive international legal framework for the protection of submarine cables. The 1884 Paris Convention and 1982 UNCLOS are unfit for purpose to address the protection of submarine cables in the 21st century.

The China Ship Science Research Center and its National Key Laboratory for Deep-sea Manned Submersibles have developed a deep-sea cable cutting device that can cut armored cables covered with steel, rubber, and polymer coatings, and is said to be a civilian device that can be used for seabed mining and salvage operations.

The team, led by engineer Hu Haolong, developed the cable cutting device and designed a titanium alloy exterior to withstand the harsh environment of water pressure exceeding 400 atmospheres. To make effective use of the limited energy available in the deep sea, the motor is low-powered and the diamond-coated 15cm diameter grinding wheel rotates at 1,600 times per minute to crush the steel-covered cable while minimizing the impact of marine sediments.

Haolong and his colleagues emphasized that the cable's intended use is for marine resource development.

China is planning to build a deep-sea 'space station' in the South China Sea for long-term research and development purposes. The cable developed this time can be used for such purposes, and is also designed to be compatible with the 10,000-meter-class manned submersible 'Fendouzhe' developed by China.

Meanwhile, some media have pointed out that the undersea cable cutting device has another use.

The background to this is the frequent cases of undersea cable cuts occurring around the Baltic Sea. In October 2023, an undersea gas pipeline and communication cable in the Baltic Sea connecting Finland and Estonia was damaged, and Finnish authorities were investigating the Hong Kong-registered container ship 'NewNew Polar Bear.' In November 2024, the Chinese-registered cargo ship 'YI PENG 3' was investigated in connection with the successive severing of the undersea cable connecting Lithuania and Sweden and the undersea cable connecting Finland and Germany. In December of the same year, Finnish authorities investigated the Hong Kong-flagged cargo ship 'Xin Xin Tian 2' and a Russian tanker ship as suspected of being responsible for the damage to the undersea power cable connecting Finland and Estonia. However, some believe that this series of events was 'just an accident.'

Since undersea cables are important facilities for establishing communication between countries, each country is taking measures to protect the cables. In particular, the United States has strengthened its anti-China strategy by adding Huawei Marine, a Chinese company that operates undersea cables, to the US 'Entity List,' which restricts access to certain products and technologies, and by canceling Google and Meta's plan to directly connect Los Angeles and Hong Kong with a 13,000 km cable, citing the risk of data leaking to China.

NATO forces have also announced plans to deploy unmanned surface vessels to protect power and communications cables that run under the Baltic Sea, and are working with Finnish and Estonian authorities to provide 24/7 surveillance of key areas.

The Hong Kong English-language newspaper South China Morning Post stated that 'if a cable is cut near a strategic point such as Guam, which is essential to the US military's defense strategy, it could disrupt global communications warning of a geopolitical crisis,' suggesting that the newly developed undersea cable-cutting device may be intended for military use.","The article discusses a newly developed undersea cable cutting device by China, detailing its capabilities and potential uses, including implications for military applications.

It also provides context regarding recent incidents of undersea cable cuts in the Baltic Sea, linking these events to geopolitical tensions.

Yemen's Starlink licensing deal could take another month to complete, according to the report, but it's unclear when exactly the country would gain official access to Starlink's services. Yemen's current internet access is ranked among the slowest in the world, according to Ookla SpeedTest [data](https://www.speedtest.net/global-index#mobile), beating only East Timor and Cuba in terms of median mobile internet download speed.

SpaceX has launched [over 6,300](https://planet4589.org/space/con/star/stats.html) Starlink satellites into space. Roughly 5,900 are still in orbit, but Starlink isn't legally available to everyone.

"Chart of Baltic Sea Underwater Cable Damage Incidents","Visual representation of 3 significant incidents damaging underwater cables and pipelines in the Baltic Sea from 2022-2025, affecting telecommunication links.","https://www.statista.com/chart/33892/damage-to-underwater-cables-and-pipelines-in-the-baltic-sea","2025-02-06T12:00:00.000Z","",Yes,"Katharina Buchholz","Hamburg, Germany","1500","2025-02-06","English","Statista","**Baltic Sea**

In the three months between November and January, three incidents of damage to Baltic Sea underwater cables have taken place, severing at least partly seven different telecommunication links that connect Baltic states like Sweden, Finland, Germany, Estonia and Latvia. All in all, Statista has counted damage to 10 different Baltic underwater cables and three gas pipes, starting with the highly publicized rupture of the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines back in 2022.

A report by The Washington Post citing anonymous officials said on January 19 that intelligence and other evidence pointed to negligence rather than malice in the case of the three incidents that took place in 2023 and 2024. Suspected in these are two Chinese-registered ships - both reportedly with Russian links - and one vessel believed to be part of Russia's so-called shadow fleet dodging sanctions by transporting oil above sanctioned price caps. Since then, however, an additional incident - the third in just three months - took place, stoking suspicion of sabotage once more. Another Russian-crewed cargo liner was detained and searched by Norwegian authorities on January 31 near Tromso at the request of Latvia after the incident that took place five days earlier, but was cleared later. Sweden meanwhile detained another ship, the Bulgarian-operated Vezhen, and determined it had damaged the cable, if accidentally.

Doubts about the events being a coincidence are persistent, however, mostly due to the 2022 Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 incidents that have at this point almost certainly been deemed sabotage. The damage done on September 26, 2022, was as dramatic as it was symbolic when detonations ruptured the two gas pipelines connecting Russia and Germany seven months after the Russian invasion - amid Europe finding it near impossible to wean itself off Russian fossil fuel. However, Russia has not been zeroed in as the only likely perpetrator in the case, with some theories now also pointing to Ukraine.

Considering this background, it’s not a surprise that Norway's search of the Silver Dania wasn’t the only one in the context of ruptured Baltic undersea cables. Denmark intercepted and boarded the Chinese Yi Peng 3, suspected to have caused cable damage in November, while Finland seized the Eagle S that it identified as having caused cable and pipeline damage this past Christmas Day. It did not help suspicion that the last remaining ship implied in the damages, the Chinese Newnew Polar Bear, carried on into Russian waters after the incident that took place in 2023 and was escorted by a Russian state-owned ice breaker.

The way in which commercial vessels have been damaging pipelines and cables is different from the initial Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 ruptures, where traces of explosives were found. The ships have been slicing the cables and pipes by dragging their anchors - often for extended periods of time. While this has led some experts to believe that the vessels in question are poorly maintained and have poorly trained crews, others have said that they find it unlikely that the crews would not notice such an issue. While damage by anchors is not as extensive as by explosives, it is still costly and can disrupt communications, electricity and gas supply for the countries in question significantly until repairs can be carried out.

With uncertainty about accident or attack persisting in Europe, other cable cutting incidents have likewise raised suspicion, for example in Taiwan earlier this month. A governing body estimates that around 150 to 200 underwater cable damage incidents happen per year around the world mostly from anchoring and fishing - which equates to around three cable repairs per week. While this makes the recent cluster of Baltic Sea cable incidents not impossible but still unlikely to occur, suspicion will continue amid ongoing tensions of Europe and other Western powers with China and Russia as well as the history of almost definite sabotage incidents in Baltic waters.","The article discusses multiple incidents of damage to underwater cables in the Baltic Sea, specifically mentioning that three incidents occurred in a short period, severing telecommunication links.

### December 4, 2017

The aging SEA-ME-WE 3 submarine cable that links Australia to Southeast Asia was cut for the third time this year, underscoring the urgent need for a more robust connection to support the region’s growing internet traffic.

According to reports, the nearly two-decade old SEA-ME-WE3 subsea cable that connects up Perth in Western Australia to Singapore and onwards to other landing points in Europe, the Middle East and Asia was cut in the wee hours of 3 December 2017.

The cable fault occurred approximately 1,126 km from the cable landing station in Singapore. Until the link is restored, internet users in Australia can expect to see increased latency to Asian destinations.

The latest damage follows a series of cuts – typically caused by ship anchors, storms and earthquakes in the region – to the same cable in recent years, including an outage in August 2017 when its insulation near Hong Kong was damaged.

“These faults can be tricky to fix, and as a cable system ages, become more prominent,” said Luke Mackinnon, head of Australian network service provider Vocus International.

Vocus is in the midst of building the Australia Singapore Cable, a 4,600 km submarine cable system linking Perth to Singapore via Jakarta in Indonesia. Vocus is expected to lay the cable in early 2018 between Singapore and Christmas Island.

“Later this month, the components will be loaded on a ship and brought to Singapore. We expect it to arrive in January. At this point we will offload a third of the cable and repeaters at Singapore. The cable laying ship will pick them up in January and start laying in February,” Mackinnon said.

Apart from Vocus, a high-powered regional consortium comprising Google, Australian research network AARNet, telcos Indosat Ooredoo, Singtel and Telstra, and SubPartners is building the 9,000 km Indigo subsea cable that will link Singapore with Perth, and onwards to Sydney.

With landing stations in Singapore, Australia and Indonesia, Indigo – to be constructed by Alcatel Submarine Networks – will also allow connections between Singapore and Jakarta.","The article titled ""SEA-ME-WE 3 Submarine Cable Cut Again"" discusses the cutting of the SEA-ME-WE 3 submarine cable, which has occurred multiple times, specifically mentioning the latest incident on December 3, 2017.

**Published Date:** January 23, 2025  
**Author:** Elisabeth Braw  

We can’t count on the stars aligning every time a cable or pipeline suffers mysterious damage, and must find ways of incentivizing ship crews to obey maritime rules.

On Christmas Day last year, Finland received a special kind of gift. Four undersea cables were damaged in the country’s waters within the course of a few hours, but Finland was already alert and watching, having decided such tricks were rather likely. And it was able to catch the perpetrator in flagrant delicto.

The U.K.-led Joint Expeditionary Force’s (JEF) plan to monitor the Baltic Sea’s undersea installations is a good next step. Finland made sure no movement went unseen. On Dec. 25, the Cook Islands-flagged Eagle S tanker damaged four undersea cables.

The tanker was slightly outside Finnish territorial waters, but authorities managed to coax the captain into sailing back into territorial waters. Had the ship remained in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), very little could have been done.

The new Nordic Warden initiative, announced on Jan. 6 by the JET, harnesses AI to assess data from a range of sources to calculate the risk posed by each vessel entering areas of interest.

This is a pioneering effort to keep the Baltic Sea’s pipelines and cables safe. On Dec. 25, the Eagle S tanker crisscrossed the gulf, damaging four undersea cables.

The Eagle S crew is now being investigated. In the past 18 months, the Baltic Sea has seen three major cases of damage to undersea installations, with some ships owned by Chinese companies also involved.

NATO and the JEF are betting that their forceful signaling will be enough to deter future sabotage, though odds are it won’t. Still, if autocratic authorities tell a shipmaster to cut undersea cables, they may feel they have no choice. We need creative thinking to incentivize good maritime behavior.","The article titled ""Let's get creative to protect undersea cables from sabotage"" directly addresses the topic of undersea cables, specifically discussing incidents where cables were damaged, including a notable incident on December 25, 2024, involving the Eagle S tanker damaging four undersea cables.

Powerful earthquakes near Taiwan shut off international phone and Internet service for the Far East just after Christmas. Five repair ships have been working on the damaged undersea cables since late last week. How do you repair a cable that’s lying across the ocean floor?

Drag it to the surface. Earthquakes—like ships’ anchors and fishing trawls—can cause undersea fiber-optic cables to malfunction or break many miles below the surface of the water. When this happens, a telecom operator has to find the location of the accident, hoist up the damaged part, and replace it with a new stretch of cable.

First, the telecom operator has to locate the part of the cable that’s no longer working. Cable engineers can figure out the general neighborhood of the problem based on the reported phone or Internet service outages. From terminal stations on shore, they can zero in on more specific coordinates by sending light pulses along the fibers in the cable. A working fiber will transmit those pulses all the way across the ocean, but a broken one will bounce it back from the site of the damage. By measuring the time it takes for the reflections to come back, the engineers can figure out where along the cable they have a problem.

Once they know that, the company can send out a large cable ship with a few miles of fresh fiber-optic lines on board to make the repairs. If the faulty part of the cable is less than about 6,500 feet down, the crew will send out a submersible tanklike robot that can move around on the sea floor. A signal can be sent through the cable to guide the robot toward the problem spot. When the robot finds the right place, it grabs ahold of the cable, cuts out the nonworking section, and pulls the loose ends back up to the ship.

The robot doesn’t work in very deep water (with very high pressure). In those situations, the technicians aboard the cable ship use a grapnel, or a hook on a very long wire, to snatch up the cable from the sea floor. The grapnel uses a mechanical cutting and gripping device that can split the cable on both sides of the break and drag the loose ends to the surface. One end is hooked onto a buoy so it won’t sink, and the other is hauled on board.

The malfunctioning cable section can be fixed on board the ship. A skilled technician or “jointer” splices the glass fibers and uses powerful adhesives to attach the new section of cable to each cut end of the original—a process that can take up to 16 hours. The repaired cable is then lowered back to the seabed on ropes.","The article 'How Do You Fix an Undersea Cable?' discusses the repair processes for undersea cables, particularly in the context of damage caused by earthquakes.

Since its launch in 2009, the AAG has experienced repeated problems, with two ruptures in 2014 and four cable cuts in 2015.

Vietnam’s Internet was also impeded between March 3 and 18 last year because of a power leak, according to local tech news website ICTNews.

As many as four separate problems have been reported with the AAG so far in 2017.

AAG and other submarine cable systems, including the Asia Pacific Gateway (APG), Intra Asia (IA) and South-East Asia - Middle East - Western Europe 3 (SMW-3) cables, are responsible for 90 percent of Vietnam’s international connections.

The APG system, which had been expected to be a reliable alternative to the AAG when it was put into use late last year, turned out to be a disappointment after a rupture was reported in June along a section connecting the central city of Da Nang with the U.S., Japan and Hong Kong.

In a rare incident in August, all three submarine communications cables crucial to Vietnam’s international connectivity – IA, SMW-3 and AAG – came down with problems simultaneously, causing global connection from Vietnam to be slowed for over a month.

**The root of the problem**

According to Nguyen Manh Hung, chairman of Vietnam National Posts and Telecommunications Group (VNPT), recent problems with Internet cables are not to be blamed on faulty designs but rather on their locations.

As most of these cables make their landing points in Hong Kong or Singapore, they can be subject to constant disturbance caused by large vessels that frequent the busy ports, leading to ruptures, Hung explained.

Other possible explanations for repeated issues include anchors dropped by ships out at sea and natural geological fractures, he added.

“As for the AAG system, the developer must take some responsibility for not having conducted careful enough surveys of the network map to allow such problems to recur so frequently,” one leader of an Internet provider in Vietnam said on condition of anonymity.

**HUYNH THANH PHI** (marketing expert):

I find it unacceptable that Internet providers simply announce a “cable cut” and tell their customers to wait for it to get fixed without taking further responsibility.

“Cable cut” has too often been used as force majeure that exempts providers from responsibility for intolerably sluggish connection speeds. As a user, I doubt this line of reasoning is still valid with the growing number of such incidents.

Internet carriers in Vietnam need to demonstrate more clearly their duty as a service provider, rather than act simply as a messenger to make announcements of “force majeure”!","The article discusses various issues related to undersea cables, particularly the Asia America Gateway (AAG) system.

It mentions specific incidents of cable cuts, including 'two ruptures in 2014 and four cable cuts in 2015', and describes the effects of these disruptions on Internet connectivity in Vietnam.

The article also identifies causes for these cable problems, such as shipping activity and geological factors, and emphasizes the responsibilities of Internet service providers in addressing these issues.

A submarine cable in the Middle East has been snapped, adding to global net problems caused by breaks in two lines under the Mediterranean on Wednesday.

The Falcon cable, owned by a firm which operates another damaged cable, led to a ""critical"" telecom breakdown, according to one local official.

The cause of the latest break has not been confirmed but a repair ship has been deployed, said owner Flag Telecom.

The earlier break disrupted service in Egypt, the Middle East and India.

""The situation is critical for us in terms of congestion,"" Omar Sultan, chief executive of Dubai's ISP DU, told The Associated Press, following the most recent break.

Wednesday's incident caused disruption to 70% of the nationwide internet network in Egypt on Wednesday, while India suffered up to 60% disruption.

Flag Telecom said a repair ship was expected to arrive at the site of the first break - 8.3km from Alexandria in Egypt - on 5 February, with repair work expected to take a week.

A repair ship deployed to the second break - 56km from Dubai - was expected to arrive at the site in the ""next few days"", the firm said.

The first cable - the Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe (FLAG) - was cut at 0800 on 30 January, the firm said.

A second cable thought to lie alongside it - SEA-ME-WE 4, or the South East Asia-Middle East-West Europe 4 cable - was also split.

FLAG is a 28,000km (17,400 mile) long submarine communications cable that links Australia and Japan with Europe via India and the Middle East.

SEA-ME-WE 4 is a submarine cable linking South East Asia to Europe via the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East.

The two cable cuts meant that the only cable in service connecting Europe to the Middle East via Egypt was the older Sea-M-We 3 system, according to research firm TeleGeography.

The firm said the cuts reduced the amount of available capacity on the stretch of network between India and Europe by 75% percent.

As a result, carriers in Egypt and the Middle East re-routed their European traffic around the globe, through South East Asia and across the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

The cause of the break has still not been confirmed. Initial reports suggested that it could have been snapped by a ship's anchor.

But Egypt's communications ministry said damage to the cables in the Mediterranean was not caused by ships.

The transport ministry said that footage recorded by onshore video cameras of the location of the cables showed no maritime traffic in the area when the cables were damaged.

""The ministry's maritime transport committee reviewed footage covering the period of 12 hours before and 12 hours after the cables were cut and no ships sailed the area,"" a statement said.

Internet service providers said they expected India's to be back to about 80% of its usual speed by the end of Friday.

In Egypt Minister of Communications and Information Technology Tarek Kamil said he expected to be at the same capacity within two days.

""However, it's not before ten days until the internet service returns to its normal performance,"" Kamil told the state Al-Ahram newspaper.","The article discusses the impact of cuts to submarine cables, specifically the Falcon and SEA-ME-WE 4 cables, which caused significant disruptions to internet services in Egypt and India.

"Maintenance and Repair Operations for Submarine Cables","Covers cable cutting procedures and fault identification, detailing the process of raising and cutting cables from the seabed.","https://kis-orca.org/subsea-cables/maintenance-repair-operations","","",Yes,-,"Grimsby, UK",-,"2019-06-01","English","KIS-ORCA","Submarine cables are very reliable, however, there are occasions when a repair to a cable becomes necessary.

Cable faults are caused by many events, both man-made and natural. In water depths greater than 1,000 metres faults are almost always caused by natural events such as underwater seismic activity, underwater landslides, current abrasion etc. In water depths less than 200 metres, faults are nearly always caused by man-made activities such as fishing and anchoring.

Around 70% of all cable faults are caused by fishing and anchoring activities and about 12% are caused by natural hazards, e.g. current abrasion or earthquakes.

When it becomes necessary to repair a cable, a cableship needs to be mobilised. Cableships are placed at strategic locations worldwide and are on 24 hour standby to carry out any repairs.

Cable systems are monitored constantly so when a system becomes faulty, it is known immediately. The staff in the cable stations at each end of the cable system then commences a series of tests to locate the fault. Once the fault location is known, this location is passed onto the cableship so it can make final plans for the repair.

The cableship will load the necessary spare cable and subsea plant required to carry out the repair. It will then sail to the fault location.

Once the cableship reaches the repair site, it will commence operations to recover the cable. The ship grapples for the cable using a large cutting grapnel (a hook), towing it along the seabed until it catches the cable. The cable is then raised off the seabed and cut. In buried sections of cable, an ROV might also be used to locate the cable and cut it on the seabed.

Once the cable is cut, the grapnel is recovered to the cableship and replaced with a holding grapnel. This grapnel is then lowered to the seabed on a rope and towed along the seabed until one end of the cut cable is engaged/caught. The cable is then raised to the surface and recovered on board the cableship. The cable is then tested and any damaged sections removed. The cable is sealed to protect it from seawater ingress and lowered back to the seabed and buoyed off.

This recovery process is then repeated for the other cable end. Once all damaged cable has been removed and the original fault identified and cut out, the cable is jointed to a section of spare cable on board, sufficient in length to replace the damaged section which has been cut out. This cable is then paid out back to the cable which had been previously buoyed off. The buoy and other cable end is recovered back to the cableship and following tests to ensure there are no further faults, the two ends are then jointed together. This is called the final splice. The final splice is then lowered back to the seabed and final tests made to ensure the cable is working correctly. Where the repair has been made in a buried section of cable, the cable is reburied by means of an ROV, water jetting the cable back into the seabed to a target burial depth equivalent to that when the cable was originally laid. A repair operation may take many days to complete.

The final splice represents a further hazard to fishing gear since the final splice is essentially a bight of wire leading from the seabed to the ship. This is held onboard by rope stoppers, then the procedure is simply to slip both stoppers and lower the bight of cable back onto the seabed. Cable burial of this section is often not completely successful due to the sharp turns in the cable and poor visibility conditions and therefore avoidance of final splices is highly recommended.

Final Splice Bights are laid on the seabed at right angles to cable line. The crown of the bight may be up to 2 x water depth from chartered cable line.","The article discusses maintenance and repair operations for submarine cables, specifically addressing the process of cutting cables when necessary.

It includes phrases such as 'the cable is then raised off the seabed and cut', 'once the cable is cut', and 'the original fault identified and cut out', indicating that the topic of cut sea cables is a central theme rather than a minor mention.

"Asia America Gateway Undersea Cable Cut","Details on internet connectivity disruptions for Vietnam and others due to the Asia America Gateway cable cut, exacerbated by tropical storms.","https://www.bcsatellite.net/blog/another-asia-america-gateway-undersea-cable-cut","","",Yes,"Patrick Gannon","London, EC4M 8AB, United Kingdom","10000","2022-04-15","English","BusinessCom Networks","In late August, the Asia America Gateway, comprised of three internet cable systems connecting Vietnam to the internet backbone were cut. It seems that two tropical storms in the region are being held responsible for the failures. According to ""The Star"" in Malaysia, two typhoons in late August, Hato, leaving three dead in its wake, and Pakhar, which also ravaged the region a few days later, contributed to the failures.

Four cables were damaged: Asia America Gateway (AAG), TGN-Intra Asia (TGN-IA), SEA-ME-WE3 (SMW3), and Asia Submarine-Cable Express (ASE). The AAG apparently ruptured in three places, all within 90 km of the Hong Kong station. The SMW3 cable connects Singapore to Perth, Australia, ASE connects Asian landings to California, and TGA-IA as well as ASE provide additional intra-Asia connections.

After suffering bandwidth losses on all systems, one, SMW3, which was put into service in 1999, was quickly restored. Meanwhile Vietnam’s ISPS, having prepared backup plans for such outages, rerouted international connections via land-based cables through neighboring countries such as Laos, Thailand and China. Branches of the AAG in Japan, Singapore and the US were put to work to handle the rerouted traffic.

The AAG is somewhat infamous, having already ruptured twice this year. In each case, repair work took about one month for each break. Similarly, the IA cable ruptured three times earlier this year. With about 60 percent of the country’s 92 million residents online, the country faces some real challenges keeping its citizens and businesses online.

### Domino Effect Across the Region

Vietnam was not the only country affected, with two of Australian ISPs being impacted, as well as routes connecting Hong Kong to the USA, Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines. At the time, the cable owners were predicting repairs to last well into October. In the meantime, Australian ISPs servicing millions of customers, are routing Asian traffic through the United States, resulting in higher latency, due to long trips across the Pacific Ocean.

As of Sept 28, 2017, the link from Perth to Asia remains unavailable. Additional damage was discovered to the insulation of SMW3. The fault is known as a “shunt fault,” a name describing damage to a subsea cable’s insulation being damaged. While no root cause has been provided, shunt faults can be caused by ocean currents, such as those that might have been generated by the typhoons, or by ship anchors.

As for Vietnam, their outage which began on August 27, was finally repaired a month later on September 30, only to encounter trouble again on Oct 12 when the AAG lost the connection to Hong Kong. These undersea cables have become vital for connectivity to the internet backbone. The TGN-IA cable system began operation in November of 2009. It spans 5,800 km, and links Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, the Philippines, Vietnam and Guam with the ability to carry 3.84 Tbit/s of traffic. This critical network of underwater submarine cables connect Asia and the United States. Nearly as impressive, the AAG cable system runs very long distances – 20,000 kilometers – and also connects Southeast Asia with the US, supporting up to 2.88 Tbit/s of capacity.

These cable systems are frequently severed or damaged, resulting in lengthy repairs that impact residential and business clients in the affected countries. BusinessCom’s broadband satellite solutions can provide redundancy and backup for mission-critical business traffic. There are no backhoes, anchors or typhoons in space. Broadband satellite connectivity is very reliable, and backed by a BusinessCom SLA (service level agreement), whether used as a primary means of internet access, a load-shared service that takes over if the primary fails, or as redundant, stand by capacity.","The article 'Another Asia America Gateway Undersea Cable Cut' discusses the cutting of undersea cables, specifically the Asia America Gateway, and details the incidents caused by tropical storms.

Egypt said it has arrested three men suspected of slicing a crucial undersea Internet cable on Wednesday, causing widespread problems from Kenya to Pakistan.

The South East Asia-Middle East-West Europe 4 (SEA-ME-WE 4) cable runs 12,500 miles from France to Singapore, with branches connecting telecommunication companies in Malaysia, Thailand, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Italy, Tunisia and Algeria.

Egypt published photos of three men in a boat with their hands tied along with scuba diving tanks. The men were apprehended just offshore where SEA-ME-WE 4 reaches land, according to a Facebook posting purportedly by Egypt's military.

SEA-ME-WE 4 is a major cable, said Doug Madory, senior research engineer for Renesys, a company that monitors global internet activity by collecting data on how traffic is routed to different service providers around the world. The cable stopped carrying traffic at 6:20 UTC on Wednesday, he said.

Undersea cables can break due to earthquakes or ship anchors, Madory said. There are fewer than 10 ships worldwide that are equipped to repair underseas cables, he said. But Egypt's might be easier for fix since it is closer to shore, he said.

If the allegation of sabotage is true, ""that is just staggering,"" Madory said. Renesys posted a graph on Twitter showing the outage affecting countries, including Kenya, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Saudi Arabia.

At least 614 networks that connect to Telecom Egypt were not working, Madory said. Hundred of smaller networks that connect to Pakistan's Transworld Associates network were also down, he said.

Renesys monitors routing information for 400 telecommunication companies worldwide. When a cable does down, Internet routers run by telecoms are designed to reroute traffic. But smaller networks that are dependant on a sole large provider to the cable could remain offline until it is fixed, Madory said.

Internet services have been disrupted in large parts of the Middle East and India following damage to two undersea cables in the Mediterranean.

There was disruption to 70% of the nationwide network in Egypt, and India suffered up to 60% disruption.

UK firms such as British Airways have told the BBC that call centres have been affected by the outage.

Industry experts said it could take up to one week to repair the damaged cables and resume full service.

International telephone calls, which have also been affected, are being rerouted to work around the problem.

Disruption also occurred in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, reported the Associated Press.

In Dubai, at least two internet service providers (ISPs) were affected.

An official at the provider, DU, told AP that a fault in a network between Alexandria, Egypt, and Palermo, Italy, was to blame.

DU issued a statement to alert customers to ""a degradation in internet services and international voice calls for some customers during peak times"".

The company said it was due to ""cuts in two international submarine cable systems in the Mediterranean Sea this morning (Wednesday).""

""We are working actively with the submarine cable system operators (FLAG Telecom and SEA-ME-WE 4) to ascertain the reasons for the cables being cut,"" it said.

The fault occurred on Tuesday afternoon in the TAT-14 fibre-optic cable system that connects the US, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, France and the UK, and is understood to have left TAT-14 unusable for traffic at present. TAT-14 is owned by a consortium of telcos. According to BT, a member of the consortium, the disruption occurred between France and the Netherlands and disrupted a range of telecommunication services.

""France Telecom will send a cable ship out to fix and repair the problem,"" said a BT spokesman, adding that the cause of the problem is not known. It's also not clear how long the fault will take to repair.

As TAT-14 is a dual, bi-directional ring of cable, a single serious fault should not be enough to break it, as traffic would still be able to flow between the countries on the ring. Unfortunately, a part of the cable near the US coast had already suffered a technical fault earlier this month, which meant there was no built-in redundancy to cope with Tuesday's failure. According to BT, the US-side fault should be fixed by the end of this week, which will bring the cable network online again.

Tuesday's failure affected BT's voice calls, rather than its data services, but it is understood that a number of Internet service providers experienced faults.

Vanessa Evans, of LINX, the London Internet Exchange, which carries nearly all UK Internet traffic and over half of Europe's Internet traffic, said she saw a drop in traffic of around two gigabits per second. At its peak, LINX sees 32 gigabits of data every second. She added that the Internet was not broken, as traffic was rerouted through other networks.

It's currently unclear whether the TAT-14 failure was responsible for problems experienced by Telewest late on Tuesday, when email and personal Web page services were unavailable. Telewest said its services were getting back to normal on Wednesday morning, but that it was still not sure what caused the outages. One theory it is exploring is that it suffered a denial of service attack.

It is understood that many other UK ISPs also suffered problems yesterday. NTL warned its customers that, due to a major server outage, ntl:home Internet customers on all packages may currently be experiencing problems with all Internet access, including Web browsing, email, ftp and newsgroups.

Updated A major internet routing outage struck UK telcos over the bank holiday weekend - knackering access to the World of Warcraft website, the BBC, Amazon, Facebook and other sites for more than 24 hours.  

It's understood that a submarine cable carrying web traffic snapped between Blighty and the Netherlands, causing headaches for ISPs. Some readers affected by the downtime had suspected that the culprit was undersea fibre optic cabling that had been mistakenly sliced.  

Rumours that some considered to be outlandish on O2's customer forum suggested that a submarine may have hit a line in the Atlantic, causing internet connection issues throughout Europe on Sunday.  

Meanwhile, officially, O2 told its customers:  
> Dear members, the recent routing issues causing unreachable destinations from our network are caused by a major fibre breakdown.  

A number of readers wondered if global internet connectivity outfit Level 3 had been responsible for the outage. However, the company confirmed to us that it too had been affected as a customer of networking biz Interoute, whose sub-sea cable was understood to be at fault.  

Level 3 said in a statement to us:  
> We do have some leased capacity from Interoute which was impacted by the cable cut. Upon notification of the failure on the Interoute Network, Level 3 took immediate action to re-route our customers onto our own network.  

UK telcos such as BSkyB and BT were apparently relatively swift at responding to the problem by routing their networks in order to keep disruption to a minimum.  

However, Telefonica - which owns O2 and Be - came under fire from its punters for what many considered to be a slow response in tackling the outage.  

One frustrated customer said on O2's [forum](http://community.o2.co.uk/t5/Home-Broadband-Home-Phone/Connection-difficulties/m-p/273606#M59420) just yesterday:

Interoute's chief technology officer Matthew Finnie has been in touch to confirm that on 27 August at 02.57am GMT, the undersea cable broke approximately 120km off the UK shore and 100km off the Netherlands shore.  

""A specialist cable marine crew and vessel have been engaged,"" he said. ""The timeline for a full system fix is currently pending. The cause of the fibre break has not yet been fully determined. However, current information suggests that the culprit was a ship's anchor.

Apparently the UK suffered a web blackout over the weekend, but it's news to me.

The break happened to an Interoute cable running to Amsterdam, some 120km off the UK shore and 100km from the Netherlands. While I don't doubt the cable was severed - Interoute itself confirmed the cut -, I do wonder at reports of chaos caused as a result.

That's because I suffered absolutely no outages over the weekend, or on Monday while working.

According to _The Register_ - the only publication to report the outage - the reason I could continue working uninterrupted is that most ISPs re-routed their traffic, with mobile operator O2 suffering the most due to parent company Telefonica's reliance on that cable. Websites including the BBC, Facebook and Amazon were also reportedly affected for about 24 hours.

Interoute apparently later told the news site the cable was likely severed by a ship's anchor. That got me curious - how many ships anchor 100km offshore and is it even possible? I couldn't find an answer to the former, but a quick search of sea depth confirmed the latter is definitely possible. The route roughly follows the area where the English Channel meets the North Sea, which includes ground that once linked the UK to mainland Europe and so is relatively shallow (around 40m versus 120m or so at the Channel's deepest points).

Either way, the incident serves as a good example of how redundancy means disruption from cable breaks can go relatively unnoticed, even by those of us in the industry.","The article titled 'UK/Europe fiber cable cut' focuses on a specific incident involving the severing of an undersea cable, which is a direct mention of cut sea cables.

**Published Date:** 03/14/2024  
**Author:** João Tomé, David Belson  

Internet connectivity in several African countries was disrupted today, March 14, 2024. Beginning at approximately 05:00 UTC, west and central African countries were most impacted, as was South Africa. Based on published reports and social media posts from impacted network providers, the disruption is believed to be due to multiple undersea cable failures in the region. From The Gambia to Côte d'Ivoire, including a major network in South Africa (Vodacom), a total of 13 African countries were impacted, based on our observations.

[Cloudflare Radar](https://radar.cloudflare.com/) data shows a pattern of disruptions from the north to the south of West Africa over time. It began south of Senegal, with The Gambia, Guinea, and Liberia experiencing disruptions around 05:00 UTC.

In The Gambia and Guinea, the disruptions lasted about 30 minutes, while in Liberia, the disruption has lasted more than 12 hours.

Moving south, around 07:30 UTC, disruptions were observed in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana.

Niger, a landlocked nation in Central Africa, experienced a disruption at 09:15, lasting just over two hours.

This was followed by disruptions starting around 10:30 UTC in Nigeria, Benin, Cameroon, and Togo. Namibia and Burkina Faso were also impacted. These disruptions were ongoing at the time of writing.

At approximately the same time, a significant disruption was observed on Vodacom’s South African network ([AS29975](https://radar.cloudflare.com/as29975?dateStart=2024-03-14&dateEnd=2024-03-14)). Traffic began to recover after 13:30 UTC, and appears to have reached close to normal levels by 16:00 UTC.

### The importance of submarine cables

This series of disruptions serves as a reminder of how dependent the Internet is on [submarine cables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_communications_cable), which are estimated to carry over [90% of intercontinental data traffic](https://blog.telegeography.com/2023-mythbusting-part-3). Only a small percentage of general use is done via satellite networks. There are [529 active submarine cables and 1,444 landings](https://submarine-cable-map-2023.telegeography.com/) that are currently active or under construction, running to an estimated 1.3 million km around the globe.

We have written about submarine cable-related outages before, from [Tonga](https://blog.cloudflare.com/internet-is-back-in-tonga-after-38-days-of-outage/) to the [AAE-1 & SMW5 cable cuts of June 2022](https://blog.cloudflare.com/aae-1-smw5-cable-cuts).

Reports from several local networks, including South Africa’s [Vodacom](https://twitter.com/Vodacom/status/1768262584413679758), [MTN](https://twitter.com/MTN180/status/1768280785084137753) in Nigeria, and [Celtiis](https://twitter.com/celtiisbj/status/1768276617967587731) in Bénin, reference multiple submarine cable failures. Microsoft was more detailed, [stating on their Azure status page](https://web.archive.org/web/20240314160638/https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status) that “multiple fiber cables on the West Coast of Africa — WACS, MainOne, SAT3, ACE — have been impacted which reduced total capacity supporting our Regions in South Africa”. The company also explains that the recent cable cuts in the [Red Sea](https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1762447960074330340?s=20) in combination with today’s cable issues, “has impacted all Africa capacity”.

In addition to the impacts to the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, the [website of MainOne](https://www.mainone.net/) owners of the [MainOne submarine cable](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/mainone), was offline for several hours. DNS for mainone.net is handled by name servers located in MainOne’s address space. It appears that a portion of the IPv4 address space for AS37282 (MAINONE) stopped being announced between 07:30 and 15:00 UTC, and once this address space was being routed again, both the nameservers and website became reachable.

**Author:** Damico, Tony M  
**Published Date:** 06/18/2024  

Multiple undersea internet cables were mysteriously severed and subsequently gained significant attention in the beginning of 2008. The attacks on those cables highlighted the enormous amount of internet traffic that uses the undersea cable system, which carries many times more traffic than the satellite system does.

The focus on the undersea internet and its growth and protection have become much more of a main stage topic since February 2008. The events occurred over a series of days and were carried out predominantly in Middle Eastern waters. Many countries had their internet services dramatically reduced as a result of the attacks.

From late January to early February, as many as nine undersea internet cables were severed. Dr. Richard Sauder wrote an interesting review of the information provided by various reporting agencies on these events.

*   Quoting the New York Times, Dr. Sauder stated, “During the height of the disruption, some 70 percent of the Egyptian Internet was down” (2008).  
*   Here, Dr. Sauder quotes CNN when discussing the first two cables that were severed, “The two cables account for as much as three-quarters of the international communications between Europe and the Middle East“ (2008).  
*   An English Daily in the UAE, the Khaleej Times, offered this statistic, “An estimated 1.7 million Internet users in the UAE have been affected by the recent undersea cable damage, an expert said yesterday, quoting recent figures published by TeleGeography, an international research Web site.” The Times also mentioned a key point to this paper, “Almost 90 per cent of Internet traffic is routed through undersea cables and only 10 per cent is done through the satellite” (2008).

These points outline the importance of undersea cable technology and its protection. How we manage security issues revolving around the maintenance and use of these giant cables will play a major role in the continuity and future use of the net.

Building new alliances and agreements that are contemporary with the technology that now exists related to the Internet has to be considered a major issue confronting government today. The very fact that most of the cable attacks occurred in Middle Eastern waters carries many political implications. While many unrelated sources have claimed that Iran was the target of these events, many countries suffered major reductions in internet traffic capabilities as well.

Various reporting agencies discussed the following list of undersea internet cables that were compromised during that short timeframe in early 2008: A cable off of Marseille, France; two off of Alexandria, Egypt; one off of Dubai, in the Persian Gulf; one off of Bandar Abbas, Iran in the Persian Gulf; one between Qatar and the UAE, in the Persian Gulf; one in the Suez Canal, Egypt; and a cable near Penang, Malaysia.

Additionally, an initially unreported cable cut on 23 January 2008 affected the following undersea internet cables: the SeaMeWe-4 (South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe-4) near Penang, Malaysia; the FLAG Europe-Asia near Alexandria; FLAG cable near the Dubai coast; FALCON undersea internet cable near Bandar Abbas in Iran; and SeaMeWe-4, also near Alexandria (Kaleej, 2008).

The impact of these cables being severed is summed up nicely by Computer Weekly: “As the undersea cables carry about 95% of the world’s telephone and internet traffic, any widespread internet downtime can have devastating economic implications” (2008). With dozens of new cables to be laid in the next few years, as reported by PC Pro in July of 2008, any disruption in the cables will have massive impact on internet users.

Conversely, one could argue that with more cables being laid, some redundancy will occur so that the increased number of undersea cables will ensure greater continuity in times of cable breakdown. In any event, protecting these cables has become more of a hot topic after theses attacks. The idea that submarines may carry men close enough to the cables to cut or otherwise damage them brings other goals to mind. A possibility exists that during the downtime of the cables, monitoring devices may be attached to gain some amount of unrestricted access to the transmissions running through the cable.

Competing governments have a direct pecuniary interest in the construction, laying, and maintenance of these cables. Control of or influence on these cables by any one entity could dramatically impact internet availability for a given population as well as information access by various governments.

The undersea cable network still carries most internet traffic and is still growing. The issue is not in building the cables, but in protecting them. Many traditional agreements between nations regarding information transfer and jurisdiction will come under fire as this unbridled communication network grows and its security becomes more and more of an international concern.

Bharti Airtel said that the cable cuts had not impacted its voice traffic but said it was taking all ‘necessary steps to ensure data services were available to our customers by routing traffic on alternative routes’. BSNL executives said the company was diverted its traffic on other cables linking India with the Europe and the US, but declined to reveal the extent of internet disruptions here. Reliance Communications said its customers were not impacted as its cable systems, including FEA, FALCON and HAWK, were not impacted, when the undersea cables were allegedly sabotaged.

Crisscrossing the ocean floor, undersea optical fiber data cables are an essential component of an increasingly interconnected world, quietly carrying massive amounts of data communications between the Earth’s landmasses.

But they are not invulnerable. Individual cables are severed or damaged dozens of times each year, most commonly by fishing boat anchors, but also by storms, scrap collectors and even shark bites.

The U.S. and other major markets, like Europe and Japan, are served by numerous cables, providing enough redundancy that traffic from a single damaged cable is rerouted before end users even notice. Wider outages, however, can have more far-reaching effects.

That’s why in October 2015, when Russian ships were observed lurking near undersea data cables, U.S. military and intelligence officials were concerned about possible sabotage.

Some experts, however, see that as unlikely.

“Cables during peacetime are protected by law under the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,” said Keith Schofield, general manager of the International Cable Protection Committee, representing the submarine cable community of interest.

Attempted sabotage, he said, would likely be detectable and stopped before any significant harm could be done to trunk cable routes.

“Before 10 or 20 percent of them were affected, owners would realize that something pretty serious was happening and could respond appropriately.”

Sean Donahue, assistant vice president and underwriter, XL Catlin

Sean Donahue, an assistant vice president and underwriter specializing in cyber and technology at XL Catlin, agreed.

“These commercial cables have too much intrinsic value,” Donahue said. “Anybody who may have that sort of capability, such as Russia … would be hurting their own self-interest.”

Seismic activity, however, has been known to damage enough cables to cause wide service interruptions and service degradation, even in areas with ample cable connections.

A 2006 earthquake in Taiwan severed several undersea cables, causing major disruptions in Asia and ripple effects that interrupted phone service to Europe. Smaller incidents can have far reaching impacts, as well.

In 2013, a string of separate cable cuts in Egypt caused widespread data slowdowns in large portions of Africa and Asia.

And a single cut off of Northern Ireland in 2015 sparked headlines claiming it had “sent broadband into meltdown.”

When cables are cut, rerouted data can overwhelm unaffected networks, causing slowdowns even for those not directly affected. Smaller countries with less redundancy — and the companies doing business with them — can suffer substantial repercussions from such events.

Even in the U.S., outages involving multiple cables could cause data traffic to be rerouted to undersea cables on the opposite side of the country, potentially triggering domestic slowdowns along the way.

As businesses become increasingly dependent on fast data communications, even minor slowdowns can impede business. For web-centric and cloud-based companies, as well as content providers, such slowdowns could be a serious problem.

According to TeleGeography, a data cable industry research firm, Google and Bing report that minor lags lead to decreased click-throughs and search result views, and “Amazon has claimed that every 100 milliseconds of latency reduces its sales by 1 percent.”

High-frequency trading companies sometimes own dedicated data cables, but others are dependent on the same networks as the rest of us, and if those networks slow down, it hampers performance and costs them money.

### **Built with Redundancy**

The undersea cable industry goes to great lengths to ensure uninterrupted service.

Peter Jamieson, chair, European Subsea Cable Association

“The systems are built with redundancy in mind,” said Peter Jamieson, chair of the industry group European Subsea Cable Association.

“You should always aim to have at least two cables from each operator so that if you lose one cable … you automatically switch onto the other one. The redundancy is built into the network on the global network as well.”

Excess capacity is also built into the system. Most cables were originally built to handle optical data traffic in a single wavelength, but they now use a technique called Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM), which handles many wavelengths.

“We are now getting potentially 400 times the capacity on one optical fiber than what you probably got 15 to 20 years ago,” Jamieson said.

Routing protocols ensure that in the case of a service interruption, data instantaneously finds alternate routes. And the different cable owners work together in various consortia to operate roughly 60 cable-repair ships throughout the world, which are on call to ensure that any damage is repaired quickly. Repairs generally take a minimum of four days to complete.

But according to Helen Thompson, director of commercial marketing at Esri, a software company specializing in geographic information systems, it is not inconceivable that the individual smart systems meant to ensure seamless rerouting could have unexpected results — much the way automated trading programs can produce dramatic and unexplained lows or highs in financial markets.

“Those individual response plans come together and aggregate in such a way that they themselves might have an impact,” Thompson said.

“It’s like the butterfly effect. … That’s increasingly the nature of connectivity and a consequence of the very widespread, multi-point-of-touch communications network that we rely on.”

While DWDM vastly increased capacity on data cables, demand and usage have been steadily catching up as businesses and individuals demand and depend on more and more data.

A company called Hibernia Express recently laid a pair of superfast transatlantic cables, the first new cables in 13 years. More may be on the way.

“The content people want to have their own fibers right now,” said Jamieson.

“So the Facebooks, Googles, Amazons and Microsofts of this world … they want to have their own fiber to control their own traffic on cable, so they are driving a lot of new systems as well.”

It is a sign of how seriously data-driven businesses take their dependence on fast, dependable transmission infrastructure.

As data usage skyrockets, Thompson cautioned against taking network resiliency and capacity for granted.

“We could be in a situation where ‘out of sight, out of mind’ [and] all these things are running at 99 percent capacity, and we’re one point … away from total failure.

“We don’t know. I’m not suggesting that is the case, but it behooves us to provide evidence that we have redundancy and resilience in the systems that we’ve become reliant on. We increasingly are engineering our future to be more dependent on them.”

Smart houses, self-driving cars, and other web-dependent gadgets and systems will not only add to data traffic, but to the list of systems that could malfunction in the case of outages and slowdowns, opening new areas of risk for homeowners, as well.

### **Protecting Data Flows**

Traditional business interruption coverage focuses on perils like flood and fire, power outages and physical infrastructure failures.

Helen Thompson, director of commercial marketing, Esri

“But, when we move to businesses where data is a utility, we have a different sort of business interruption, and that is going to be increasingly important to service-based economies,” said Thompson.

“We think about site liability and data breaches, but what I think we’re going to start moving to more and more is providing business interruption insurance around data.”

Cloud coverage insurance is still a rarity, but probably not for long. “Many more companies should think about cloud computing insurance,” she said.

“It will become a vital part of what’s included in business interruption insurance.”

Businesses should know their providers’ contractual obligations and dependent business interruption coverage in case of outages, as spelled out in the service level agreement, she said.

“More and more major businesses are expecting that as part of their service level agreement,” Thompson said.

“I think that will become an integral part of the transfer of risk and liability. If you’re completely dependent upon the web and the cloud to do business, and you don’t protect yourself with a service agreement on the cloud provider, you’re going to be subject to claims from other people. So, that discussion with your insurance provider should be absolutely central.”

Even with coverage, however, calculating business interruption losses, especially for traders and other market-dependent businesses, can be extremely difficult, particularly during incidents that may themselves be roiling the markets.

“Can you prove that you would have made X amount of dollars versus Y amount of dollars because of a degraded service?” Donahue asked. “There’s a lot of moving parts to that scenario.”

99% of the internet network runs through submarine cables. It is estimated that over USD 10,000 billion in financial transactions run today through these “seabed highways”. This is especially the case of the main global financial exchange system, SWIFT, which has recently been banned for many Russian banks. The security of these transactions is a political, economic, and social problem. This is a major issue that has long been ignored. The extreme geographic concentration of the cables makes them particularly vulnerable. There are over 420 submarine lines in the world, totalling 1.3 million kilometres, over three times the distance from Earth to Moon.

Submarine internet cables have a crucial importance, like oil and gas pipelines. In the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the seabed is more than ever a battlefield that must be protected. Western armed forces are considering a nightmare scenario of total interruption of the Internet in Europe, as 99% of the global network runs through submarine cables.

Satellites account for only 1% of data exchanges. The reason is simple: they cost more than cables and are infinitely slower.

**A hundred submarine cable breaks a year**  
These infrastructures are equally important today as oil and gas pipelines. But are they equally protected? Modern submarine cables use fibre-optic to transmit data with the speed of light. However, while in the near vicinity of the shore, cables are generally reinforced, the average diameter of a subsea cable is not much larger than that of a garden hose.

For several years, the major powers are fighting a “hybrid war”, half open, half secret, for the control of these cables. As Europe focuses increasingly more on threats to cybersecurity, investments in the security and resilience of physical infrastructure that are the basis of its communications with the world does not seem to be a priority today.

The fear to act will only generate the vulnerability of these espionage systems, interruptions of data flows and undermining the security of the continent. On average, there are over a hundred breaks of submarine cables every year, caused in general by the fishing boats that pull the anchors. It is difficult to measure intentional attacks, but the movements of some ships have started to draw attention since 2014, their route following submarine telecommunication cables.

The first attacks of the modern age date back in 2017: it is about the cables between the UK and the US and between France and US. Although these attacks remain unknown to the general public, they are no less worrying and prove the capacity of external powers to separate Europe from the rest of the world. In 2007, Vietnamese fishermen cut a subsea cable to recover composite materials and try to resell them. Vietnam lost this way almost 90% of connectivity with the rest of the world for a period of three weeks.

**Potential risks**  
Creating a European program to increase EU’s capabilities to prevent attacks on this infrastructure and repair the damages that they could cause is more urgent than ever. Russian “fishing” or “oceanographic” vessels and which are, generally, collectors of information, are increasingly traversing the coasts of France and Ireland through which these “information highways” pass.

**A map of submarine cables around the world**  
TeleGeography, a US telecommunications consultancy, has created the Submarine Cable Map portal, an interactive map of all submarine cables unfolding around the world, with data about the companies that own them, such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Verizon, or AT&T. On the map, we can see that a key highway is in the Atlantic Ocean, which links Europe and North America. In the meantime, the Great Pacific Highway links the United States of America to Japan, China, and other Asian countries.

**Cutting submarine cables, an old and proven practice of war**  
Recent attacks on cables carrying voice and data traffic between North America and Europe lead to the idea that they seem to be undergoing a new development. France and the United Kingdom had already dealt with this experience on the part of the Germans during the First World War. These infrastructures were part of the global cable telegraph network. Similarly, the United States cut wartime cables as a means of disrupting the ability of an enemy power to command and control distant forces.

**Russia interested in NATO’s subsea infrastructure**  
Russia seems to materialize the concerns at the highest level in this field. In 2015, the presence of Russian vessel Yantar along the US coast, near the cables, did not fail to arouse tensions between the two states. At the end of 2017, the situation repeated.

**Three major security risks**  
The first risk factor is the growing volume of data flowing through cables, which encourages third countries to spy on or disrupt traffic. The second risk factor is the increasing capital intensity of these facilities, which leads to the creation of international consortia involving up to dozens of owners. Another threat is espionage, which requires specially equipped submarines, or submarines operating from ships, capable of intercepting, or even modifying, data passing through fibre-optic cables without damaging them. The most vulnerable point of submarine cables, however, is where they reach land: the landing stations.

**Solutions in case of multiple attacks**  
The US executive has recently investigated possible risks in the event of multiple attacks.","The article 'Submarine Cables: Risks and Security Threats' discusses the topic of cut sea cables extensively.

**Author:** Tudor Vieru  
**Published Date:** 12/22/2008  

European rescue boats rushed to the sea on Friday, with the express “find and fix” command firmly issued by telecommunications companies in both the Middle East and Europe. It's believed that the underwater lines were severed by an inattentive captain, who lowered the anchor of his ship in a place where such action is expressly forbidden, due to the hazard of entanglement on the floor of the Mediterranean Sea. The split occurred somewhere between Sicily and Tunis, but the engineer ships still have a tough time tracking down the ends of each cable.

If an anchor indeed ripped the two cable apart, then it's possible that the severed ends of the lines are miles apart from each other. That's why engineers already started scanning the bottom of the ocean with an automated submersible, dubbed Hector. The little submarine, controlled from a ship above, will scout the deep sea, in search for the ends of each line. Finding them fast could potentially save millions of dollars.

Once the ends are located, they will be brought to the surface, and stitched back together. However, this is a very difficult process, as a France Telecom Marine spokesman, Louis-Michel Aymard, admitted on Sunday. ""We have to fix the cable fibre by fibre, and it's a very huge cable."" The cables were allowed some leeway, instead of being firmly attached to the ocean floor, to compensate for drifting current or anchor hits. But accidents where the anchors sever the cables are not uncommon.

Egypt already managed to divert a substantial part of its Internet and telephone traffic through auxiliary lines, and is therefore safeguarded against any negative effects that the rupture may have. However, other Middle Eastern nations are not that fortunate and depend substantially on the two cables. If the teams of engineers fail to reconnect them soon, then this seemingly harmless incident could translate into an increase in the economic difficulties prompted by the international financial crisis.","The article titled ""Underwater Data Cables Severed by Ship Anchor"" discusses an incident where underwater data cables were severed by a ship's anchor.

It directly mentions 'underwater lines' and 'severed cables', which are synonymous with cut sea cables.

The article elaborates on the implications of this incident for telecommunications, particularly highlighting the impact on internet connectivity for countries in the Middle East.

For example, it notes that Egypt has managed to divert traffic through auxiliary lines, while other nations may face economic difficulties if the cables are not repaired quickly.

Internet and phone communications between Europe, the Middle East, and Asia have been seriously disrupted after submarine cables were severed. It is thought the FLAG FEA, SMW4, and SMW3 lines, near the Alexandria cable station in Egypt, have all been cut. A fault was also reported on the GO submarine cable 130km off Sicily.

Experts warned that it may be days before the fault is fixed and said the knock-on effect could have serious repercussions on regional economies.

Jonathan Wright, director of wholesale products at Interoute which manages part of the optical fibre network, told the BBC that the effects of the break would be felt for many days. ""This will grind economies to a halt for a short space of time,"" he said. ""If you look at, say, local financial markets who trade with European and US markets, the speed at which they get live data will be compromised.""

""If you think how quickly trades can be placed, if they are suffering from bad latency times, then by the time a trade is placed, the market may well have moved on.""

The cause of the break is as yet unknown, although some seismic activity was reported near Malta shortly before the cut was detected. A second subsea cable to Malta is currently being laid.

In a statement released in relation to one of the breaks, France Telecom said: ""The causes of the cut, which is located in the Mediterranean between Sicily and Tunisia, on sections linking Sicily to Egypt, remain unclear.""

The French firm said it was sending a ship out to fix the line between Italy and Egypt, although it could take until 31 December to fully repair the line. The main damage is to the four submarine cables running across the Mediterranean and through the Suez Canal.

It is thought that 65% of traffic to India was down, while services to Singapore, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Taiwan and Pakistan have also been severely affected. Earlier this year, the same line was damaged in the same area - off the Egyptian coast - although only two lines were snapped then.

""We've lost three out of four lines. If the fourth cable breaks, we're looking at a total blackout in the Middle East,"" said Mr. Wright. ""These three circuits account for 90% of the traffic and we're going to see more international phone calls dropping and a huge degradation in the quality of local internet,"" he added.

Three of the 16 subsea internet cables that run through the Strait of Bab el-Mandeb have gone down, according to the Wall Street Journal, degrading internet service to the Subcontinent and East Africa.

The Houthi leadership has denied any involvement or responsibility for the presumed damage to the cables, and the cause has not been established yet. It is possible that it was unintended: Anchor-drag accidents cut internet cables regularly in locations around the world, and the Red Sea has a high density of subsea telecom infrastructure. For the Houthis, though, it is clear that Western powers are responsible.

“The hostile acts against Yemen by naval military units belonging to Britain and the United States have caused an outage in the maritime cables in the Red Sea, jeopardizing the security and safety of international communications and the natural flow of information,” the Houthis' putative Ministry of Transport said in a statement Friday. ""[The U.S. and UK] are using hostile and illegal methods in their war against Yemen to serve the Zionist enemy (Israel), in order to continue committing genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza.”

The ministry added that it is ""keenly interested"" in the safety and security of subsea cables off the Yemeni coast, particularly since the cables serve nations with which the group has cordial relations. It promised to ""provide all services and grant necessary permits"" to cable companies to allow them to enter the area and make repairs.

The latter guarantee, if honored, would be of value to cable operators. The routine drumbeat of Houthi attacks on shipping have driven away half of the Red Sea's usual maritime traffic, and operating a slow-moving cable layer in high-risk waters near Yemen would require assurances from both sides of the standoff.

Some maritime analysts have noted that the bulker Rubymar, which was hit by a Houthi missile two weeks ago, may have crossed over some of the cable routes while it was abandoned and adrift. The crew dropped anchor before they left their stricken ship, but the vessel meandered northwards for 13 days - potentially dragging anchor - before it finally went down.","The article titled 'Houthis Blame Western Alliance for Subsea Cable Damage' directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables by discussing damage to subsea internet cables in the Red Sea.

Johannesburg, 30 Mar 2020

In February, cable ship Leon Thevenin was used to fix broken undersea cables.

A cable vessel is on its way to fix the broken West Africa Cable System (WACS) submarine cable that is causing slow Internet speeds in SA.

This is according to the latest reports from the RENAlerts service by SANReN and TENET. The reports say it is estimated the repair will be completed by 4 April.

The cable break was first revealed on Saturday by the South African National Research & Education Network (SANReN), a major user of the cable, which detected the break just before midnight.

The break came at a time when South African Internet service providers (ISPs) are reporting increased network traffic as more people are working and learning from home to curb the spreading of the coronavirus.

Says SANReN in a tweet: “WACS Outage Update: Cable vessel, the ‘Ile D'Aix’, under way to the SV8 (Highbridge UK) side cable break. ETA at cable ground –Tue 31/03/2020 09h00 UTC. Estimated repair date: Sat 04/04/2020.”

WACS is a submarine communications cable linking SA with the UK along the west coast of Africa that was constructed by Alcatel-Lucent.

The cable consists of four fibre pairs and is 14 530km in length, linking from Yzerfontein in the Western Cape of SA to London in the UK.

In January, WACS also suffered a cable break together with the SAT3/WASC cable, resulting in slow Internet speeds in SA.

The cables were fully restored in February.

### Contingency plans

For the latest break, ISPs have started putting in place contingency measures to mitigate the slow speeds.

Liquid Telecom SA, part of Pan-African telecoms group Liquid Telecom, yesterday announced it had mitigated network outages due to the unexpected loss of connectivity following a recent break in the WACS undersea cable.

“To help ensure continuity of service, Liquid Telecom’s network traffic is automatically re-routed during such outages,” says Reshaad Sha, CEO of Liquid Telecom South Africa.

“We are responding to new and increased demand from customers with additional capacity across alternate routes. Liquid Telecom operates a five-cable system for our international Internet capacity in South Africa. Our resilient architecture means the loss of the WACS capacity is unlikely to impact customers’ connectivity as demand surges.”

Last year, Liquid Telecom South Africa announced its advanced core network enhancements offering customers near unlimited bandwidth capacity, says the company.

“The replacement of our core network has not only catered to legacy performance issues but has made Liquid Telecom’s network one of the most technologically advanced, modern and reliable networks in South Africa and across the African continent. It has also addressed one of the core needs of local enterprises around network capacity,” Sha adds.

Seacom says while repairs on the WACS undersea cable systems are being planned, many ISPs will need to re-route their traffic via alternative paths, such as Seacom’s east coast undersea cable or other routes.

As a result of the WACS cable system issues, customers may experience increased latency as alternative routes are implemented.

“Seacom is aware that due to issues on the WACS cable system on Africa’s west coast, many African ISPs and their customers could be experiencing unstable or slower speeds when using the Internet. Seacom’s network platform is also affected by the WACS issues, but as the Seacom cable system on Africa’s east coast is continuing to work normally, Seacom endeavours to provide ISPs that rely heavily on WACS with diverse capacity on the Seacom cable system,” the company says in a statement.

Meanwhile, Angola Cables says: “Angola Cables has announced there has been an interruption in the supply of services on the submarine cable section of WACS which connects Seixal, Portugal to Highbridge in England. “

However, it says the services that Angola Cables provides to its customers remain operational across the 11 WACS cable contact points on the west coast of Africa.

Data connections and access to global content and services continue to be provided – given the robustness and redundancy of the Angola Cables network, it notes.

“As a top priority, Angola Cables and the consortium of WACS partners are working to restore the cable's full capacity to impacted customers as soon as possible.”

Telkom unit Openserve says it has activated additional international connectivity capacity. It explains this additional capacity will alleviate and minimise impact on Openserve’s network, and that of its clients, while repairs to the WACS and SAT3/WACS cable systems continue.

“We expect to have a full capacity when the SAT3 system comes alive tonight,” says the company.","The article discusses the broken West Africa Cable System (WACS), detailing its implications on internet connectivity in South Africa.

Full repairs to three submarine internet cables damaged in the Red Sea in February are being held up by disputes over who controls access to infrastructure in Yemeni waters.

The Yemeni government has granted permits for the repair of two out of three cables, but refused the third because of a dispute with one of the cable’s consortium members.

Repairs to the Seacom and EIG cables have been approved, but the consortium that runs AAE-1, which includes telecommunications company TeleYemen, was not granted a permit by Yemen’s internationally recognized government, according to documents seen by Bloomberg.

Three out of more than a dozen cables that run through the Red Sea, a critical route for connecting Europe’s internet infrastructure to Asia’s, were knocked offline by the Houthi-sunk Rubymar vessel in late February. Although the telecommunications data that passes along the damaged cables was re-routed, the incident highlighted the vulnerability of critical subsea infrastructure and the challenges of making repairs in a conflict zone.

The dispute over the third cable derives from the split political control of TeleYemen, the country’s sole telecommunications provider, a reflection of the country’s broader geopolitical divisions. The company has two branches, one in Aden under control of the internationally recognized Yemeni government, and the other in Sanaa under the control of the Houthi militia group. The Yemeni government refused to cooperate with the Houthi-linked part of TeleYemen associated with the AAE-1 cable consortium and sought to appoint a representative from the Aden branch, according to the documents. But the consortium didn’t approve the alternative representative and Yemen’s government declined to grant a permit, according to the documents.

E-Marine, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi-based Emirates Telecommunications Group Co. PJSC, is contracted to carry out the repairs.

The Aden branch of TeleYemen, affiliated with the Yemeni government, wrote a letter to Yemen’s Telecommunications Ministry demanding that E-Marine provide a £10 million ($12.5 million) bank guarantee to ensure it would not carry out any repairs on the AAE-1 cable when the company was fixing the other two cables until the dispute was resolved. The ministry initially approved the condition, according to the documents, but Yemen’s cabinet decided it wasn’t necessary, a senior government official told Bloomberg.

E-Marine did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Houthi telecommunications ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

It’s unclear if the Houthis, an Iran-backed militia group which controls much of Yemen’s Red Sea coastline, including the key port of Hodeida, will let E-Marine fix the two cables. The group, which has been attacking ships in the area with drones and missiles for months, has previously said only it can grant permission for the repairs.

The repair ships will take about a week to reach the cables and then approximately two days to fix each one, according to Seacom Ltd.’s Prenesh Padayachee. The cables will be lifted to the surface and fresh cable will be spliced in to replace the damaged sections.

The repair crew will also assess the Rubymar, the Houthi-sunk ship whose anchor most likely severed the cables in February. Seacom estimates that the ship is currently about 1 kilometer away from its cable, Padayachee said, and seems to be stable.

“But we don’t want to do a repair and then have this vessel falling into the new cables,” he said. “In all likelihood it will have to be moved.”

The three damaged cables carry about 25% of traffic in the region, according to estimates from Hong Kong-based internet provider HGC Global Communications, which uses the cables.","The article titled 'Full Repairs to Damaged Red Sea Internet Cables Delayed by Yemen Political Splits' focuses on the topic of submarine internet cables, specifically detailing the damage caused to three cables in the Red Sea and the political disputes affecting their repair.

Three men arrested by the Egyptian army for 'cutting undersea cable'  
If the bid was successful it could have taken an 'entire continent offline'  
It comes after one of the biggest cyber-attacks ever launched  

Published: 12:36 EDT, 28 March 2013 | Updated: 17:19 EDT, 28 March 2013  

Three men have been arrested by the Egyptian army for apparently trying to cut through an undersea Internet cable.  

A patrol stopped a fishing boat near the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria and arrested three divers, an army spokesman said on his official Facebook page.  

It is believed they were trying to cut through an SEA-ME-WE 4 undersea cable - one of the main connections between Asia and Europe, running from France to Malaysia and linking Italy, north Africa, the middle east and south Asia.  

If the men had been successful, experts warned they could have taken an 'entire continent offline', but interruptions were reported around the region, including Dubai and India, today.  

The cable targeted, the SEA-ME-WE 4, is 18,800 kilometres long, and is the primary internet 'backbone' between south-east Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East and Europe. It has 17 landing points.  

The men were reportedly just 750 metres off the shore of Alexandria when they were caught.  

No indication of who the men were or what their motive for cutting the cable was. It is also unclear how much damage was done.  

But Sky News reported that there was evidence of slow internet connections as far away as Pakistan and India.  

The cable is owned by Telecom Egypt, the biggest web provider in the north African country and slow services were expected to be improved by the end of today.  

Operator SEACOM said in the hours that followed the men's arrest that it was confident that full service would be restored quickly.  

Submarine cables are expensive to build but they deliver a huge amount of capacity.  

Failures can be catastrophic. One cable failure - between Sicily and Egypt - left more than 50 per cent of India without power in 2008.  

Jim Cowie, chief technology officer of US-based Renesys, said a cut cable can cause data to become congested and flow the long way around the world.  

The same SEA-ME-WE 4 was seriously damaged back in 2008 by a ship's anchor.  

News of the men's arrest comes after a bitter feud between two online companies has already been blamed for days of disruption for internet users, in the biggest cyber-attack ever launched.  

Spam-fighting organisation Spamhaus said it has been subjected to a massive cyber-attack.  

But if the men had been successful in their undersea sabotage attempt, it would have effectively switched off 1.28 terabits — four times as much bandwidth— and with nothing more high-tech than an axe.  

It said: 'Most big countries have several redundant cables landing on their shores.  

'But the loss of even a single one means that all the traffic must be jammed through remaining connections, causing congestion.  

In the past week there have been several reports of severed cables off the coast of Egypt that are part of Seacom, a network of cables serving much of Africa.

The article also provides context about the cable's significance, mentioning that it is a primary internet backbone and has previously suffered damage that affected internet connectivity across multiple regions, including Dubai and India.

Additionally, it references other recent cable cuts in the region, indicating a broader issue with undersea cable security and connectivity.

Industry experts told _The Times_ that two sub-sea cables went down just off Alexandra, causing the mass disruption. It happens to a single cable typically once a year, and companies have developed the fail-safe of redirecting traffic to a second cable should this occur.

""It is incredibly rare to experience a dual-break where both cables are down simultaneously,"" said a spokesperson for Interoute, the internet networks company.

The Egyptian ministry said it will take ""several days"" for cables to be repaired and is trying to reroute Egypt's internet connections.

Indian ISPs said their problems were due to the cable damage off Egypt. Speaking to reporters, Rajesh Chharia, president of the Internet Service Providers' Association of India, said: ""Information technology companies, software companies and call centres that provide online services to the UK or the US east coast are the worst affected.""

Rafaat Hindy, from the Egyptian ministry, said: ""Despite this being an international cable affecting many Gulf and Arab countries, we are closest to it and so we have a lot of responsibility. We are working as fast as we can.""

**It is thought that up to 70 per cent of web services in Egypt, and 60 per cent in India, were disrupted yesterday.** There were reports that phone and internet difficulties had spread to Yemen, Sudan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

**The shut down will take several days to fix, and could have a major impact on the region and across the world. It is likely to hit businesses who will struggle to communicate in the affected countries.** Call-centres who work for British companies are likely to be offline or hard to contact in the coming days. Others warned that bank and stock market trading could be affected.

The digital blackout highlighted the _vulnerability of global communications_. Hundreds of millions of people access the web, but the vast majority of international traffic runs through a small amount of cables submerged below the sea.

**Industry insiders warned that a domino effect was occurring today, causing the disruption to spread across the globe.** As companies' private internet services went down, workers were forced to use the public internet and mobile phones to communicate. This has resulted in a heavy strain on phone and internet networks, meaning calls could go down and cause the internet to become slower or blackout completely.","The article discusses the damage to undersea cables in detail, highlighting the significant internet disruptions it caused across multiple countries.

"Giant Robot for Undersea Broadband Cable Repairs","Details the innovative robot technology used to repair undersea cables, crucial for restoring broadband connectivity after breaks, impacting internet speeds.","https://www.wired.com/story/fixing-submarine-cables","","Condé Nast; James Temperton",Yes,"James Temperton","New York City, New York, United States","500000","2015-02-26","English","Condé Nast","**This giant robot fixes undersea broadband cables**  
Earlier this month the undersea cable carrying broadband to Northern Ireland broke, slowing internet speeds down to a crawl. It took a specially designed ship and two crews of 30 people a fortnight to get broadband speeds back to normal. But how do you go about fixing a cable that's just six centimetres in diameter, lying over 100 metres down at the bottom of the stormy Irish Sea? You use a robot. A really big one.  
Breaks in undersea cables are nearly always caused by fishing trawlers or anchors being dropped in the wrong location and dragged across the sea floor. Earthquakes have also been known to damage cables in Asia -- while shark attacks are something of an industry myth.  
The cable that broke in the Irish Sea is one of two owned by Virgin Media, which connect the countries of the United Kingdom with Ireland. Finding and fixing the fault is the job of Peter Jamieson, Virgin Media's principal engineer and chairman of industry organisation Subsea Cables UK. ""Fixing a cable at sea is no easy task,"" he tells WIRED.co.uk. ""There are many variables in play and it requires a steady hand and even steadier ship, plus expert teams who work round the clock to get the job done.""  
As well as being incredibly small, fibre optic cables are also very complicated. Virgin's contain 48 optical fibres, each capable of carrying huge amounts of data. A poor repair job can reduce the capacity of a fibre, so it has to be done just right. To complete the fiddly job some seriously hefty machinery is required.  
Jamieson and his team chartered the Pierre de Fermat, a ship specially designed to manage the installation and maintenance of all kinds of undersea cables. The ship, which measures 100 metres long and 21.5 metres across, uses GPS and manoeuvrable thrusters to keep it in the same position, even in the stormiest seas. ""The first job is carried out by onshore Virgin Media engineers, who are sent to both ends of the cable as soon as a network alarm has alerted us that there's been a break,"" Jamieson explains. The teams then use laser pulses to identify exactly where the break is and dispatch the repair ship to the location. Once on site, the ship launches a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), which hunts down and retrieves the cable.  
Once the cable has been found and returned to the ship a new piece of undamaged cable is attached. The ROV then returns to the seabed, finds the other end of the cable and makes the second join. It then uses a high-pressure water jet to bury the cable up to 1.5 metres under the seabed.  
Repairs normally take around ten days from the moment the ship is launched, with four to five days spent at the location of the break. Fortunately, such incidents are rare -- Virgin Media has only had to deal with two in the past seven years. ""These days I manage the process from dry land. The repair operation has to be perfect every time -- once it's done you never want to go back,"" Jamieson says.

"Unraveling Subsea Cable Failure in Offshore Wind","50% of insurance claims in offshore wind are linked to subsea cable damage; average costs of cable failures significantly impact industry finances.","https://www.imca-int.com/published-articles/imcas-new-code-of-practice-could-save-millions-for-the-offshore-wind-industry-by-preventing-subsea-cable-failure","","",Yes,"Mark Ford","London, England","3000","2023-11-02","English",-,"Published on 2 November 2023

According to a report by _GCube Insurance_ in 2021, the average insurance claim nearly doubled from £1.7 million (€2 million) in 2010-2015 to £3.1 million (€3.6 million) in 2020. In total, claims for offshore wind grew from around £124 million (€145 million) in 2010-2015 to around £500 million (€585 million) in 2020. Of these, around 50% were down to damage to subsea cables, with other insurers estimating that damaged subsea cables represent between 70% and 80% of their claims.

It is clear to me that if we are to meet the huge ambitions placed on Offshore Wind by nations around the globe and meet Net Zero targets, we will need to find new – and better – ways of working.

A recurring problem for the Offshore Wind industry is damage caused to the submarine power cables during the installation process – nine out of ten insurance claims on cables are due to installation damage, and the _Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult_ in the UK estimates that damage incurred during installation contributed to 46% of all power cable failures.

At the point at which cables leave the laying vessel and meet the seabed, they are frequently subject to damage caused by over-bending, cable-pulling, and inadequate design of lead into the monopile. While installation contractors can use Sonar or ROV monitoring to observe the cable as it leaves the vessel, this is an expensive approach which will not work if stirred-up sediment is affecting visibility. Finding a way to detect installation damage should be an essential priority for the industry.

In a study carried out in 2019 by the _University of Strathclyde_, the average rate of power cable failure is approximately 0.003 failures/km/year for European wind farms. This means that a wind farm with 100km of power cable has a 30% chance of cable failure in any given year. The average downtime for an inter-array cable repair is around 40 days, and 60 days for an export cable. On average, inter-array cable damage costs between $1.8 million to $12 million, and export cable damage costs between $10 million to $30 million.

Faced with this technical challenge, the industry has now responded through the International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA) with a new [Code of Practice](https://www.imca-int.com/product/imca-code-of-practice-for-offshore-cable-laying-in-the-renewable-energy-industry/) (IMCA M264) which applies to all vessels that lay cables in an offshore environment and which sets a new baseline for successful cable installation.

It defines minimum requirements for safely laying offshore submarine power cables within the renewable energy industry covering topics such as laying spread (the combined systems including cable lay operation centre, Linear Cable Engine, main cable turntable, drums/tensioners, clamps, support, rollers, etc..), the cable lay vessel or barge on which it is installed, the interface between the vessel and the spread, and the safest ways for over boarding, trenching and cable pulling.

Building on the technical expertise of IMCA and its Members, the new document sets the standard of acceptable practice for everyone in the industry, including energy companies. As a Code of Practice, it will be used to formulate technical specifications within contracts, which means it can potentially have a huge and positive impact on an industry looking for practical solutions and tangible improvements to how we work.

The product of positive and proactive industry collaboration, the Code of Practice not only recognises the experience of major contractors who have a wealth of experience in the design, testing, operation, and maintenance of cable lay equipment and its interface with supporting vessels, but also recent analytical techniques and innovation based on now readily accessible technology.

All of this means that our Code of Practice will enable the industry to overcome the challenges for subsea cable laying safely and efficiently and help our sector to continue to play its part in meeting huge expectations.

The tactic of cutting undersea communications cables goes back at least as far as World War One when Britain cut German cables in the English Channel in order to force the Germans to use long distance radio transmissions instead. This gave British Intelligence the opportunity to intercept and decrypt the communications, ultimately providing the _Zimmerman Telegram_ which played a part in bringing the United states into the war.

"The Biggest Threat to Subsea Cables","70% of subsea cable faults caused by human activities, risking global communication and incurring substantial repair costs.","https://ultramapglobal.com/the-biggest-threat-to-subsea-cables","","UltramapGlobal",Yes,"UltramapGlobal","Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom","5000","2020-03-09","English","UltramapGlobal","This article on subsea cable threats is consistently the most read UltramapGlobal article throughout 2018 and 2019 so we’ve updated it for March 2020.

Subsea cables carry data and energy keeping our world connected so why wouldn’t you protect them from damage that can mostly be prevented?

The subsea cables market is growing. As of 2019 there were approximately 378 subsea cables in service globally spanning over 1.2 million kilometres carrying power and transmitting data from continent to continent.

By the time we progress further into 2020 it’s estimated there will be around 2 million kilometers of subsea cables worldwide.

**Subsea cable threats**

Around 70% of all cable faults are caused by fishing and anchoring activities (man-made) and around 14% are caused by natural hazards (current abrasion or earthquakes).

The 70% caused by man-made activity is made up of…

**Fishing activity from trawlers** – Over a 3rd of all cable damage is caused by fishing activity. Trawling and fixed nets including stow nets cause damage. The East Asian region has high cable fault rates as stow nets are used intensively in the East China Sea. Their large anchors drag through the mud and damage cables. Pair trawling uses a net towed between two vessels which can snag cables resting on the seabed causing damage.

**Damage from anchors** – 25% of subsea cable damage arises from ship anchors. Large anchors of fishing vessels and merchant vessels cause cable damage. Anchoring outside designated areas causes damage. Dragging anchors in error during passage causes damage (recent fault records show that merchant ships sometimes do not fasten their anchors securely during short passages and these can cause cable damage).

**Why proactively protect cables?**

The obvious reasons to protect subsea cables are to:

*   Prevent damage from occurring in the first place which causes downtime whilst a cable is being repaired.
*   Avoid substantial repair bills that can run into millions.
*   Protect the uptime of customers services such as internet, telephone and electricity etc.
*   Potentially lower insurance costs.

**How to protect cables**

Most companies only react when cables are damaged in the first place. Only then do they implement some form of cable monitoring and protection to prevent future incidents.

Man-made damage can be prevented by placing protection zones around cables that alert cable owners when a vessel is getting too close to their assets.

"Severed Fiber-Optic Cable Disrupts Internet in Alaska","Cut 34 miles north of Oliktok Point; affects internet and cell service for communities including Utqiagvik and Nome.","https://www.govtech.com/network/severed-fiber-optic-cable-leaves-alaskans-without-internet","","June 14, 2023 • Alena Naiden, Anchorage Daily News",Yes,"Alena Naiden","Folsom, California, US","4250","2023-06-14","English","Anchorage Daily News","(TNS) — Residents of several North Slope and Northwest Alaska communities have been experiencing Internet and cell service interruptions this week caused by a cut to the subsea fiber-optic network. The cut might take up to two months to repair, and telecommunications service providers are looking for short-term solutions to bring service back online.

Quintillion, which provides broadband connectivity in Arctic Alaska, on Sunday experienced a subsea fiber cut about 34 miles north of Oliktok Point, offshore from Utqiagvik, Quintillion President Mac McHale said. The cut caused a systemwide outage, affecting Utqiagvik, Wainwright, Point Hope, Kotzebue, Nome and Atqasuk, McHale said.

""All of our broadband services are impacted by this,"" McHale said. ""And they're not compromised — they're completely out.""

While the company was still confirming the cause of the breakage on Monday, heavy ice movement most likely cut the fiber cable, McHale said. The breakage is significant, given the fact that the cable is buried beneath the ocean floor, below 90 feet of water, McHale said.

To fix the cut, repair crews need to wait until the ice breaks up around Oliktok Point, which is expected to happen at the end of June or early July, McHale said.

""We'll be on-site at that point in time,"" he said. ""We're looking at probably six to eight weeks.""

As of Monday, the company was working to isolate the repairs, assess the damage and find the right tools to conduct the repairs, McHale said. They were also looking for backup solutions in the meantime.

Quintillion's customers include telecom companies across Northwest Alaska and the North Slope, such as Alaska Communications, GCI, OTZ Telecommunications and Arctic Slope Telephone Association Cooperative.

The North Slope communities served by the Arctic Slope Telephone Association Cooperative were experiencing various levels of outages Monday, said Rebecca Sparks, ASTAC external relations manager.

""We have four communities with varied outages. They vary from community to community, but overall we have long-distance cellular and Internet outages taking place,"" she said. ""They can call within their community.""

In several North Slope villages, not including Utqiagvik, backup 911 services were also affected by the outages, Sparks said.

Utqiagvik resident Mary Lum Patkotak said that she had no Internet at work and couldn't make cellphone calls.

""It's extremely frustrating not to be able to contact my children and nieces,"" she said. ""We are so used to being connected.""

In the Northwest Arctic Borough, Kotzebue residents were experiencing Internet outages Monday, said Kelly Williams, CEO at OTZ Telecommunications. A backup facility kept voice and emergency services working.

""A few businesses are closed due to no Internet,"" Bruce Nelson of Kotzebue said. ""NAPA is cash only.""

The other 10 village communities served by OTZ Telecommunications are fed off a satellite system and don't rely on the subsea fiber-optic network, Williams said.

The company was also working on alternative satellite technologies to get Internet services up by the end of this week or early next week, Williams said.

Some GCI customers in rural Alaska — particularly those in Utqiagvik, Nome, Kotzebue, Wainwright and Point Hope — also experienced slower Internet and wireless service due to a network outage, GCI spokeswoman Heather Handyside said in a statement. Handyside said the company redistributed some of the services to other networks to address the issue.

""Shortly after the break was reported, GCI began to migrate some impacted services to GCI's satellite network,"" Handyside said. ""This transition was completed quickly.""

The company has issued several statements since Friday last week saying that they are in the process of restoring transmission. However, South African internet provider Internet Solutions notified their clients that repairs could last till April.

In an email dated 23 March, Internet Solutions responded to a service request by saying that the impact of the current cut and subsequent repairs will be increased latency from South Africa, and “Repairs to be completed ETA 05 April 2013”.

Yesterday morning Seacom issued another statement regarding the repair process, and said that “Seacom continues to work to restore transmission customers across the Mediterranean Sea. Optimisation of the IP network is also ongoing to relieve congestion where we can.”

On Saturday 23 March, Seacom CEO Mark Simpson issued a statement on the company’s website saying that while customers have been told a cable was cut, the actual cause is still unknown and could take some time to repair.

“I know that many of you are keen to know the cause of the outage is a physical cable cut some kilometres north of the coast of Egypt in the Mediterranean Sea. This is not likely to be known until the cable is repaired in the coming week or two and the damaged section is recovered from the seabed and inspected,” he said.

As with previous issues experienced off the Egyptian coast, Simpson suspects a large ship to be the culprit.

“We suspect, based on our experience with sub-sea systems and the nature of the sea area where the cut has occurred, that the most likely cause is external aggression to the cable most probably caused by a larger vessel dragging its anchor across the sea bed. Unfortunately this remains a common cause of damage to cable systems globally, despite our continued efforts to protect the cable with armour, burying, notifications to ships of cable location and exclusion zones.”

“While we believed we had secured adequate restoration capacity between Egypt and Europe yesterday (Friday), it has since eventuated during today that the physical capability to connect this capacity to our services in Europe is neither adequate nor stable enough. In addition the capacity that may be available is in a long line of activations requested by many carriers and is not progressing at the rate we, or our customers, need,” he added.","The article titled 'Seacom outage could last till April' addresses the damage to the Seacom undersea cable, which is a direct reference to the topic of cut sea cables.

It discusses the implications of this damage on international internet connectivity between Africa and Europe, stating that repairs could last until April and that increased latency will be experienced due to the cable cut.

The article also includes a statement from Seacom's CEO, Mark Simpson, confirming that a cable was indeed cut and speculating on the cause, which is likely due to external aggression from a larger vessel.

"Repair Efforts for Severed Internet Cables","Repairing two severed internet cables in the Mediterranean Sea, causing 70% service disruption in Egypt and 60% in India, utilizing advanced Optical Time Domain Reflectometers.","http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7228315.stm","","",Yes,-,"London, England, GB","250000","2008-02-05","English","BBC News","**Work has begun to repair two damaged internet cables in the Mediterranean Sea that were severed last week.**

Flag Telecom, one of the firms responsible for the cables, says it will take about a week to be fixed.

The break in cables has caused disruption to net services in the Middle East and India. The cause is still not known.

Repairs will involve a team of about 50 people, including navigation experts and cable engineers, said Flag Telecom.

The ship that will repair the first severed cable is already in place, with repairs underway, while the second vessel is expected to begin work on Tuesday.

**Bespoke ships**

""It will be a highly technical job and should take a week to complete,"" a spokesperson for Flag Telecom told the BBC News website.

The cause of the damage has not been officially confirmed but there have been reports that the breaks were related to a tanker dragging its anchor along the sea bed.

However, the Egyptian communications ministry has denied any ships were in the area at the time of the break.

The first job in such a situation was to find the exact location of the damaged cable, said Mark Harper, manager of cable system support at Cable and Wireless.

The firm is not involved in the repair operation, but has carried out similar work in the past.

Often the location of a break can be found by cable engineers back on shore. The areas affected by the outage will give key clues as to what part of the cable is broken.

To get a more precise location, cable engineers can send light pulses along the fibres in the cable using a device known as a Optical Time Domain Reflectometer.

When the pulses hit the broken part of the cable they will bounce back and by measuring the time it takes for them to return, engineers can ascertain the location of the damage to within tens of metres.

The next stage is to employ a specially fitted cable ship, which will have onboard remotely operated vehicles (ROVs).

**Fishing**

If the ROV is able to locate the cable it can cut out the non-working sections and pull the cable back onto the ship.

Alternatively a device onboard known as a grapnel can hook the cable from the sea floor and drag it on to the ship.

""The first option is preferable because it means you can recover the cable very close to the end whereas a grapnel is less precise,"" said Mr Harper.

Grapnels have been in use for hundreds of years, and so were part of the equipment employed when the first telegraph cables were laid.

The damaged cable can be repaired on the ship at which point a technician will splice new cable to the existing pieces.

Once repaired it can be lowered back to the seabed.

Two cable operators were involved in this most recent outage.

FLAG Telecoms, which has responsibility for the Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe (FLAG), a 28,000km (17,400 mile) long submarine communications cable and SEA-ME-WE 4, or the South East Asia-Middle East-West Europe 4 project - which links South East Asia to Europe via the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East.

There was disruption to 70% of the nationwide network in Egypt, and India suffered up to 60% disruption.

Disruption also occurred in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, reported the Associated Press.

In Dubai, at least two internet service providers (ISPs) were affected.

In December 2006, seven of the eight cables connected to Taiwan were damaged by an earthquake, disrupting communications in much of Asia.

These cables took several months to fully repair.

Natural disasters are one of several causes of cable outages.

In this case, an errant anchor has been blamed and Mr Harper believes there is ""still a partial conflict between the needs of shipping and of telecoms"".

But it is not the biggest problem facing cable operators.

""Fishing is still the biggest issue.

Earlier this year there were 378 undersea fiber cables in place that stretch over 745,000 miles. Here’s an [interactive map](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/) that shows all of the cables and also allows highlighting of individual cables.

What’s most intriguing about the map is that there are a few cities around the world where numerous cables terminate. One such place is New York City, and Superstorm Sandy cut the connections of several fibers, and the connection between the US and Europe went dark for a few hours. The companies building the cables are now considering diversifying the terminal locations of the fiber cables.

Cables also routinely get cut from other events such as earthquakes, underwater mudslides, ship anchors, and even a tiny number from sharks. There is an average of about 25 underseas fiber cuts per year. Repairs are made by ships that pull the cut ends of the fiber to the surface and splice the ends back together. There have been a few fiber cuts where there was suspicion of sabotage, but it’s never been proven. There is no real way to provide security for undersea cables, and the routes of the cables are well known. It’s been a poorly kept secret that spy agencies around the world tap into various cables to monitor traffic.

Undersea fibers are made differently than other fiber. Since the biggest danger from fiber cuts is in shallow water, the cable for shallow locations is as thick as a coke can and is routinely buried under the surface. At deeper depths below 8,000 feet, where the dangers of fiber cuts are minimal, the cables are only as thick as a magic marker. There are cables laid as deep as 25,000 feet below the surface. One unusual aspect of underseas fibers is the use of an underlying copper layer that is used to transmit the electricity needed to power fiber repeaters along the long underseas paths. The cables can be powered with as much as 10,000 volts to force the power along the longest Pacific routes.

The undersea fiber paths carry over 99% of the traffic between continents, with the small remainder carried by satellites. Satellites are never expected to carry more than a tiny fraction of the traffic due to the gigantic, and constantly growing volume of worldwide data traffic. The FCC estimated that only 0.37% of the US international data traffic is carried by satellite. The capacity of the newer cables is mind-boggling—the Marea cable that was completed between Spain and Virginia in 2018 has a capacity of 208 terabits per second. No satellite network is ever going to be able to carry more than a tiny fraction of that kind of capacity. Worldwide bandwidth usage is exploding as the users on the Internet continues to grow (there were 1 million new users added to the Web every day in 2018). And just like in the US, usage per person is growing everywhere at an exponential rate.

One thing that is obvious from the fiber map is there are parts of the world or routes that don’t exist. The companies that fund the cables build them to satisfy existing broadband needs, which is why there are so many cables between places like the US and Europe or between countries in the Mediterranean. There are no routes between places like Australia and South America because there is not enough specific traffic between the two places to justify the cost of a new cable route. While cable routes terminate to India and China, one would expect to see more fibers added in coming years. These two countries are currently seeing the biggest number of new Internet users (in 2018 there were 100 million new users in India and 80 million new users in China).

The cables have traditionally been built and owned by the world’s biggest telecom companies. But in recent years, companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon have been investing in new undersea fibers. This will allow them to carry their own traffic between continents in the same way they are also now carrying terrestrial traffic.

Undersea cables are designed for a 25-year life, and so cables are regularly being retired and replaced. Many cables aren’t reaching the 25-year life because the built-in repeaters become obsolete and it’s often more profitable to lay a larger capacity newer cable.","The article discusses undersea fiber cables in detail, including the frequency of cuts, causes such as natural disasters and human activities, and the significant impact these cuts have on global communication.

It specifically mentions incidents like Superstorm Sandy that resulted in cable cuts affecting connectivity.

An arrest warrant has been issued for a Newfoundland fishing vessel after another subsea telecommunication cable was broken last summer off the coast of Atlantic Canada.

#### Expert says fishing vessels continue to cause many of the 200 cable faults a year around the globe

In a statement of claim filed last week in federal court, Nova Scotia-headquartered Eastlink accuses the vessel Oceans Joy of damaging its cable, costing the company nearly $1 million in repairs.

It was at least the fourth time an underwater cable was snapped by a fishing vessel in the region between May 2013 and July 2014.

Subsea cables are essential pieces of internet and phone infrastructure that connect the globe, however damage by fishing continues to be a problem.

There are roughly 200 cable ""faults"" a year around the world, most of them caused by fishing gear and anchors, according to Doug Burnett, a New York-based cable law expert.

Century-old Maritime law allows cable companies to make claims against those vessel owners, he says.

The process of determining which vessel is at fault has been made significantly easier with the growing use of ship trackers such as the Automatic Identification System.

#### Recourse for fishermen

But fishermen also have recourse if they accidentally snag a subsea cable. If the crew cuts the trawl or anchor to preserve the cable, the vessel owner is entitled to compensation from the cable company.

In the latest case to reach court in Halifax, Eastlink says on July 17, 2014, its network operation centre detected the loss of ""optic signal,"" between Rose Blanche, N.L., and Sydney, N.S. A segment its Persona cable made up of 24 optic fibres sheathed in armour was completely severed.

The break was fixed by International Telecom, a cable repair company out of Halifax. Eastlink says the total cost was $972,696.72, according to its statement of claim.

Eastlink says the Persona cable is properly marked and charted and accuses the owner, master and crew of the Oceans Joy of negligence.

#### Customers' service not disrupted, says Eastlink

Eastlink says service for customers was not disrupted. The case is one of a number of cable damage claims that have ended up in court in the last year.","The article discusses the damage caused by a Newfoundland fishing vessel to a subsea telecommunication cable, highlighting the incident's significance in the context of global cable faults caused by fishing activities.

August 23, 2024

Several links on the Eastern Africa Submarine System (EASSy) have been offline since Tuesday due to shunt fault, MyBroadband has learned.

An industry source with knowledge of the situation explained that traffic to the Middle East and Central and Eastern Europe was the most affected and seeing increased latency.

However, unlike the [incidents earlier this year](https://subtelforum.com/south-africa-internet-hit-by-multiple-subsea-cable-breaks/), the fault does not appear to have caused major disruptions to the continent’s Internet.

EASSy is a 10,000 km submarine cable system along the east coast of Africa, with nine landing stations in Sudan, Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Comoros, Madagascar, Mozambique and South Africa.

It is a consortium cable owned by several telecommunications companies, including WIOCC, MTN’s Bayobab, Vodacom DRC, Liquid Intelligent Technologies, and Telkom.

WIOCC is the largest shareholder in the EASSy consortium.

According to TeleGeography, the other owners are BT, Bharti Airtel, Botswana Fibre Networks, Comores Telecom, Djibouti Telecom, Etisalat UAE, Mauritius Telecom, Orange, Saudi Telecom, Sudatel, Tanzania Telecommunication Corporation, Telkom Kenya, Telma, and Zambia Telecom.

A shunt fault is a type of power feed problem that occurs when the insulation protecting a submarine cable becomes damaged.

These cables use underwater amplifiers to boost the light signal propagating along their fibre optic strands, which require power.

Power is fed from either end of the cable and flows along a metallic outer core that surrounds the optical fibre.

These cores — the fibreglass and conductor — are wrapped in insulation and protected using a strong material like Kevlar.

However, damage can still occur from ship anchors, fishing trawlers, backhoe dredgers, powerful ocean currents dragging the cable, or even sea creatures like sharks.

When the insulation becomes damaged, it can create a short circuit from the cable’s metallic core to the seawater, causing a shunt fault.

A WIOCC spokesperson told MyBroadband that the cause of the cable break is currently unknown.

Seacom, a South African internet connectivity provider, told its customers that it is experiencing a service-affecting outage via the West African Cable System, a submarine network.

MainOne, a major internet provider for most Nigerian banks and internet providers, also suffered a major fibre cut in Ghana that has knocked many major Nigerian banks offline, according to internal communication sent to bank staff and seen by TechCabal. As a result, customers of major Nigerian banks cannot access their banking apps or use any USSD service.

Multiple sources have also confirmed that they have been unable to use their banking apps or access the internet smoothly since Thursday morning. Sterling Bank, a Nigerian bank, has issued a communication to customers informing them that some online banking activities have been “experiencing difficulties”. Lemfi, an African remittance startup, has also informed customers that it is experiencing a downtime.

“A technical team is actively working on a solution,” someone familiar with MainOne’s business told TechCabal.

A spokesperson for MainOne declined to comment on the situation.

“Traffic is currently being rerouted via alternate paths, with no current congestion. However, services towards Europe from Maputo and South Africa are at risk should the alternate paths fail,” a statement from Seacom said.

Thursday’s internet outage extends beyond Nigeria, with South African internet users also experiencing slow speeds and unresponsive internet. According to news24, Vodacom confirmed that multiple subsea cable failures between South Africa and Europe were impacting several network providers.

Several other submarine cables such as AAE1, EIG have also suffered outages across Africa.

Following the subsea cable cuts, which affected the Africa Coast to Europe (ACE), the West African Submarine Cable, and MainOne cables, MTN Group’s Bayobab, a digital connectivity solutions company, issued a statement on Friday informing its customer that ACE and WASC are already being repaired.

by William Furey and Patrick McSherry  
  
The cutting of the cables at Cienfuegos was one of the most remarkable events of the Spanish American War. In the face of severe fire, a group of men raised the cables through which communications passed between Cuba and the outside world.  
  
**Background:**  
The USS MARBLEHEAD was built by City Works in Boston, Massachusetts, being launched August 11, 1892. During the Spanish American War, the cruiser steamed from Key West, Florida, for war patrol duty in Cuba, under the command of Captain McCalla. The vessel arrived off Havana on April 23, 1998. Two weeks later, at Cienfuegos, she shelled enemy vessels and fortifications while her crewmen and that of the NASHVILLE cut the communications cables.  
  
On May 11, 1898, near the lighthouse at the entrance of Cienfuegos Harbor, the MARBLEHEAD located the telegraph cables leading from the south and west into the cable house, used for communication between Cienfuegos, Havana, and Spain.  
  
Commanding officer McCalla of the MARBLEHEAD prepared to cut the cables. Volunteers were requested to go on a landing party to drag the ocean floor to locate and then raise the cables. Once raised, the cables would be physically cut.  
  
Lt. Cameron McR. Winslow was placed in charge of the steam and sailing launches from the USS NASHVILLE and the MARBLEHEAD with Lt. Anderson, 2nd in command. Ensign Magruder of the NASHVILLE commanded a steam launch that dropped the sailing launches opposite the Cable House, took position of 150 to 200 yards off shore and gave covering fire. The two main cables were cut, but due to intense gunfire from the enemy, an attempt to cut a third smaller cable found on shore had to be abandoned.  
  
During the firefight, the lighthouse was destroyed as the Spanish troops, hidden in gullies and ravines, rained a hail of bullets onto the cable cutting party, resulting in many casualties, including three deaths. Of the men who took part, forty-nine received the Congressional Medal of Honor.

Undersea sub-cables have just broken...**  

Breaking news: something’s happening to the internet, right now. We’re just not quite sure what.

Interoute, the internet networks company, reports that three of the four internet sub-cables that run from Asia to North America have been damaged.

These carry more than 75 per cent of traffic between the Middle East, Europe and America. It’s hard to gather what this actually means – is it that the internet is down or (more likely) significantly slower than usual between the Middle East and America? (If you’re reading this, let’s face it, the internet has not shut down altogether)

But, according to the company, there is a domino effect taking place. Interoute says it is:

> hearing that offices have lost their entire private network connectivity. As a result, users are unable to do their daily job over the internet and are turning to their mobile phones to communicate across the globe. This is having a knock on effect on the domestic voice networks, which are getting a surge of calls needing to be routed internationally. These calls need to be routed onto international gateways that pass voice traffic in longer directions around the world to avoid the cable breaks – causing more quality issues and risk more call failures, in turn causing more calls to be placed and increasing the pressure on local voice networks.
> 
> What (I think) this means is that companies’ private internet services have gone down. So, if they can get access, they have had to go on the public internet and mobile phones, like the rest of us average joes, to get their work done. That results in more strain on mobile phone networks, which means more phone calls go down and the internet becomes slower.

Here’s the big problem right now:

> Finance companies [are] looking to settle trades on European and American exchanges. This cable outage means there is no real-time access to, for example, trading ticker services. This means branch offices are compromised when trying to place trades. As private networks are being affected, these organisations are forced to rely on public internet services that may have more latency and may not update as quickly. The loss of time even precious seconds is hugely important to trading exchanges. These public internet services are now struggling to cope with peak in demand – leading to increased latency, and further compromising the integrity of the trading data.

I’m told that these major sub-sea cables break once a year. So companies have developed a fall-back plan. If one sub-sea cable is out, traffic is re-routed onto a second cable. In theory, a dual break, where both cables go out at once, is incredibly rare. Prior to January this year, it had not happened before.

The problem with all of this is that it’s hard to see the impact, or its significance, until something disastrous happens. So, we’re keeping an eye on it and like we said, er, something’s happening to the internet.","The article provides a comprehensive discussion on the recent damage to undersea sub-cables, detailing specific incidents, their causes, and the significant impact on internet connectivity and communication.

The strategic importance of cables, pipelines and other critical subsea infrastructure is underlined by recent sabotages in a context of hybrid warfare.  
  
Over the last months, the war in Ukraine and the numerous implications it has brought about in the field of grey-zone warfare have come to show the fragile situation of undersea cables, gas pipelines and critical subsea infrastructure in general. Just a month after the sabotage which took place in the Baltic with the explosion at the Nord Stream pipelines, several cuts were reported simultaneously, in late October 2022, at the Faroe and Shetlands Islands (North Atlantic), and at the south of France near Marseille.  
  
The strategic importance of subsea cables is quite significant given the amount of information and digital transactions which run through them each day while they still remain notably unprotected. For years, many analysts have underestimated such importance; and only during recent times has the issue become central to maritime security discussions. Among some of the early advocates on the importance of critical seabed infrastructure we find current UK Prime Minister (back then a Member of Parliament), Rishi Sunak, who prepared a report back in 2017 on the vital importance of these infrastructures. In it, he pointed out to the fact that “there is no alternative to using these undersea cables”, which in just a single day “carry some $10 trillion of financial transfers and process some 15 million financial transactions”. Despite their criticality for global telecommunications, subsea cables remain largely unprotected. The vulnerability already mentioned is further compounded by the fact of that their location being is available to the general public.  
  
In most cases, the cables laid down in offshore areas are buried in the seabed to prevent them from getting damaged easily with the ships’ anchors or the fishing nets. However, as recent events have demonstrated, these safety measures aren’t enough to prevent incidents from taking place. Thus, in the face of such irony, what is the current scenario regarding undersea critical infrastructure and its importance for maritime security in general? How could it be further protected in order to avoid major disasters from happening?  
  
**Incidents**  
As mentioned above, during late October 2022, several undersea cables at both the Faroe Islands (of Danish sovereignty) and the Shetlands Islands (a British territory), and the in the Southern France’s Mediterranean waters were simultaneously damaged. The former incident left a great part of the islands’ population without any access to the Internet, while, in the latter, which happened on October 19th, at least three key fiber optic cables connecting Marseille to Lyon, Barcelona and Milan were also cut. It is noteworthy that Marseille, a hub connecting the European, Asian and African continents, is among the most critical locations for cable communications infrastructures in the Mediterranean, with a total of 13 cables reaching it (including the Medusa Submarine Cable System, IMEWE, Africa-1 or Asia Africa Europe-1).  
  
Immediately after these simultaneous incidents took place, there were mixed viewpoints as to what the causes might have been. Páll Vesturbú, head of Infrastructure for Faroese Telecom, pointed to fishing activity as the most likely cause of the incident: “We expect it will be fishing vessels that damaged the cable, but it is very rare that we have two problems at the same time.” And while this may be a plausible explanation, there are people who feel even more skeptical to the possibility of these events happening by accident. Hans Tino Hansen, the CEO of Risk Intelligence, suggested that “the probability of this happening once by mistake is low and the probability of this happening twice is insignificant and non-existent for a third and fourth time when measured against normal trawler behavior.”  
  
The cybersecurity company Zscaler, which had its services interrupted as a result of the incident in Marseille, published a report soon after it took place. In it, the company detailed how it was “aware of a major cable cut in the South of France that has impacted major cables with connectivity to Asia, Europe, US and potentially other parts of the world.” The report also confirmed that the interruption had affected links between Marseille and Lyon, Milan and Barcelona.  
  
Marseille is known for being a key node linking home to 13 undersea cables connecting the European, Asian and African continents. The incident shows how, as it has already been stated, these cables and underwater infrastructure are, in most cases, notably unprotected against threats and sabotage and other threats. In the case of the recent events in the region (which resulted in the disruption of phone and Internet services for several hours), initial investigations carried out by the French authorities suggested they could well be a case of sabotage.  
  
In a parallel case, as Justin Shermann, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Cyber Statecraft Initiative, has pointed out, one of the initial steps taken by Russia in 2014 when they invaded the Crimean Peninsula was to damage one of the undersea cables linking the peninsula to the Ukrainian mainland. Thus, both with the Nord Stream incident and the recent events in the Shetlands and the Mediterranean, Russian activity has received much attention as the potential responsible behind. Nevertheless, nothing has conclusively been proven yet.

In this context of exposure of undersea cables, prior to the incident, France had already boosted their surveillance around its undersea infrastructures prior to the incident, as announced in mid-October, when President Emmanuel Macron publicly unveiled the purchase of a deep-sea drone and a robot to be used against these kinds of attacks. The initiative is part of a military program of the French government expected to be deployed by 2025, with the robots able to reach depths of 6,000 meters. Yet, having such a fleet of drones to boost surveillance doesn’t ensure sufficient protection, especially for a country like France, given the vast number of cables it has extended along the seabed, specially for a country like France. With around 30 cables coming into its territory, and the wide range of techniques available to damage these infrastructures, the task is of considerable difficulty. Cyrille Dalmont, a researcher at the Institut Thomas Moore Institute, suggests a plausible way to make sabotages harder is to increase the number of operational cables. According to him, the only real defense would be “to lay down further cable lines”, so that a concrete act of sabotage “can’t result in a blackout.”  
  
In early 2023, NATO defense ministers announced a plan to strengthen undersea infrastructure and prevent incidents like the one happening with the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines. Their explosion, confirmed as a sabotage with explosives, is yet another example of critical undersea infrastructure that remains vulnerable to hostile intentions at the same time as being easily to disrupt. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced the establishment of a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell at NATO. Led by German Lieutenant General Hans-Werner Wiermann, this center represents a positive initiative and starting point for the Alliance to keep building on; the face of the challenge Russia or China could pose if restoring to the disruption of allied undersea critical infrastructure. So, how is it that these critical infrastructures can be protected? There are several nations across the Mediterranean region and other parts of the world which rely on a certain number of these cables to carry out their daily operations, and for which an incident disrupting the traffic these lines carry with them would have terrible consequences. Thus, it is in their best interest to ensure their undersea infrastructure can be adequately monitored and preserved from external attacks. France is among those nations.  

Protecting its extensive network of undersea critical infrastructure is among the top priorities for the French government. Having the second largest maritime area in the world, France is particularly concerned about the fact that only two of its robots are able to dive below 2,000 meters. This leaves many cables in a vulnerable position against hybrid attacks.","The article titled ""Undersea cables’ vulnerability: A hidden network of vital connectivity"" discusses the critical importance and vulnerability of undersea cables, particularly in the context of recent incidents of sabotage and damage.

It's also a physical system of wires that stretch every which way, some of which travel under the ocean. That's a point of weakness as recently illustrated when three of these cables were cut by a poorly-dropped anchor. Not for the first time, and probably not for the last.

The affected cables run along the seabed in the English Channel and serve the Channel Islands. According to the BBC, the two companies that jointly own the cables have taken to fixing it, but the process could take up to three weeks.

It would take a whole lot of bad luck to drop anchor directly on top of a submarine cable on three separate occasions, so the more likely explanation is that the ship was dragging its anchor along the channel's floor, scraping an off-limits area where multiple cables run. There is still a connection left, but it requires all data from the islands to be pushed through a single cable that routes everything through France, which is leaving folks on the affected islands dealing with serious slowdowns.

This isn't the first time this has happened. In 2008, a ship dropped anchor and severed a cable to Dubai that left 75 million people in the city and greater region with limited internet access. In 2012, a similar blunder had ramifications in a number of countries. It's not even the first time this has happened in the English Channel, as the BBC notes. An anchor sliced up some cables there back in January of this year.

Fortunately this incident is only messing up internet connectivity for a relatively small amount of people and isn't cutting off access completely, but it's increasingly clear that anchors and submarine internet cables just do not get along and that warning boats where not to drop anchor isn't a completely effective solution. Hopefully we can come up with something more fool-proof before someone slices through a bunch of truly crucial cables.","The article 'Ship's Anchor Slices Through Three Undersea Internet Cables' directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables by detailing an incident where three undersea cables were severed by a dropped anchor.

"Undersea Cable Cut Near Egypt Disrupts Internet Across Africa and Asia","Significant internet slowdowns affecting millions due to the SEA-ME-WE 4 cable cut, exacerbated by simultaneous maintenance of other major cables.","https://old.gigaom.com/2013/03/27/undersea-cable-cut-near-egypt-slows-down-internet-in-africa-middle-east-south-asia","","On March",Yes,"On March","Santa Barbara, California, United States","2000000","2013-03-27","English","GigaOM","It is like Groundhog Day! Once again an undersea cable has been cut — the South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 4 (aka SEA-ME-WE 4) cable and that is causing an internet (and communications) slowdown in and around Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia. The cut was said to be near Alexandria in Egypt. Tata Communications administers the network.

While the cut was on a single cable, it came at an unfortunate time as a few other major cables were in “maintenance mode” and that has resulted in problems for service providers across the region. Our sources in the telecom community confirmed that two other cables — Europe India Gateway (EIG) and India-Middle East-Western Europe (IMEWE) — were in ‘maintenance’ mode when the SWM4 got cut. The result is downstream congestion on networks that are going to India and around the Indian Ocean. UAE’s Etisalat reported that the internet speeds were down by as much as 60 percent in some locations.

Sunil Tagare, who runs the BuySellBandwidth.com, on his blog wrote:
> It’s not good enough to say since you have 10 cables even if going through Egypt, you have route diversity. And as today’s 4 cable cuts have demonstrated, any time the cables are along similar paths, there is a high likelihood that all of them might be cut at the same time.

He was arguing that four major cable — I-Me-We, Sea-Me-We-4, EIG and TE North – were impacted at the same time and thus causing problems in the Middle East and Asia. It is not a smart way to think about the networks, especially since we depend so heavily on many of these optical cables. Tagare’s argument makes sense to me, for we have seen this pattern repeat itself a few times. As I wrote earlier, there are three major cables that connect Europe and Middle East — SeaMeWe-3, SeaMeWe-4 and FLAG Euro-Asia — and they follow the same path underneath the Mediterranean Sea, making them vulnerable to cuts.

In 2010, the SEA-ME-WE-4 experienced a cut causing large scale disruptions, two years after the cable experienced an outage. Things have become more acute now considering that SEA-ME-WE4 is a lifeline for the African internet.

SEACOM, an African consortium which owns the big African Internet cable, later confirmed the outage on its website and said that it was working towards restoration. SEACOM had already been experiencing problems since March 24 and was in the middle of fixing those before it was hit by the cable cut.

Mark Simpson, CEO of SEACOM, said in a press note:
> The cause of the outage is a physical cable cut some kilometres north of the coast of Egypt in the Mediterranean Sea. This is not likely to be known until the cable is repaired in the coming week or two and the damaged section is recovered from the seabed and inspected. However we suspect, based on our experience with sub-sea systems and the nature of the sea area where the cut has occurred, that the most likely cause is external aggression to the cable most probably caused by a larger vessel dragging its anchor across the sea bed. Unfortunately this remains a common cause of damage to cable systems globally, despite our continued efforts to protect the cable with armour, burying, notifications to ships of cable location and exclusion zones.

By the way, SEAMEWE-3 experienced a cut about two months ago (between Singapore and Perth, Australia) and it hasn’t been fixed just yet mostly because the network operator was waiting for Indonesian government permission to fix the cable which is in Indonesian waters.","The article titled 'Undersea cable cut near Egypt slows down Internet in Africa, Middle East, South Asia' provides a comprehensive discussion on the topic of cut sea cables.

Today, 99 percent of our transoceanic data traffic—including phone calls, text and e-mail messages, Web sites, digital images and video, and even some television—travels across the oceans via undersea cables. These cable systems, as opposed to satellites, carry most of the intercontinental Internet traffic. In her new book, _The Undersea Network_, New York University assistant professor of media, culture and communication Nicole Starosielski tracks submarine systems as they thread together small islands and major urban hubs, conflicts at coastal landing points, and Cold-War–era cable stations.

In this excerpt Starosielski visits the network operations centers where global cable systems are monitored and maintained by a small group of elite engineers.

_Excerpted with permission from_ _The Undersea Network_, _by Nicole Starosielski. Available from Duke University Press. All rights reserved. Copyright 2015, by Nicole Starosielski._ **Gateway: From Cable Colony to Network Operations Center**  Entering the network operations center of a globe-spanning undersea cable system, I find what you might expect: a room dominated by computer screens, endless information feeds of network activity, and men carefully monitoring the links that carry Internet traffic in and out of the country. At first glance, it seems to be a place of mere supervision, where the humans sit around and watch machines do the work of international connection, waiting only for a moment of crisis, such as when a local fishing boat drops an anchor on the cable or a tsunami sweeps the system down into a trench.

This vision of autonomous networks is shaped more by Hollywood cinema than by actual cable operations. In reality, our global cable network is always in a sort of crisis and, at the same time, highly dependent on humans to power the steady flow of information transmissions.

It would perhaps be more precise to say that cables are always in a state of “alarm.” An “alarm,” in network-speak, is anything from an indication that the cable has been severed to a reminder about a needed computer update. Undersea systems are not so different from our personal computers. They need regular updates and upgrades. They are susceptible to bugs and environmental fluctuations. Sometimes things just don’t work as planned. The men in a network operations center work daily to resolve a continually updated batch of alarms, which at this particular location number around 120–150 per week. The vast majority of these are only warning alarms, which notify them of some approaching threshold, a problem with a backup system, or a source of potential interference. Even if our signals continue to pass through cable systems without delay, the undersea network never quite functions perfectly on its own, that is, without alarm and without human assistance.

System errors can be produced by even the smallest events. The stations where undersea links terminate house immense cooling systems, and with all of the air conditioners blowing dust around, regular cleaning is required. Yet even when companies employ specialized cleaning crews, there is often an increased number of alarms during the process. By contrast, during Christmas the number drops dramatically. An operations manager explains what might seem obvious: “when you haven’t got people touching stuff it tends not to break.” The inside of his station testifies to the danger of human hands. The primary fibers running in from the sea are labeled with bright tape reading “Danger Optical Fiber,” to warn anyone who enters the station not to touch them. During Super Bowl weekend, another company planned not to have any activity in their station at all, just to ensure that nothing went wrong. The circulation of human bodies, necessary for network operation, inevitably bump, jostle, and set equipment into an alarm state.

Alarms can also be generated by the machines themselves. Although network equipment is supposed to be identical and thus predictable, in reality each device displays remarkably individual behavior and can produce errors without anyone even coming into contact with it. One manager gripes to me that their station just hadn’t gotten the right piece of transmission equipment, and once it had started to have bugs, it required repeated maintenance for most of its life—a kind of problem child. Another cable engineer explains that each machine has been manufactured using different batches of raw materials and assembled at different times. Two circuit packs might be technically identical but might function differently over the course of their lifetime, in part because different computers contain materially different components. The glass or the solder wire may have been of a different quality or come from a different origin. This can result in “batch faults” which occur in a series of equipment manufactured at the same time. The engineer uses an analogy to explain the process: “It’s a bit like making a fruit cake. I can make a fruit cake on Monday and I can make one on Wednesday, but they can be different even if I followed the same recipe. In the one on Monday I might have used 198 grams of sugar and the one on Wednesday I might have had 205 grams of sugar. Very, very minor differences could have an unknown impact sometime in the future.”

The men at this network operations center are tasked with reading the incessant feed of alarms, determining what needs to be fixed, and conducting the necessary maintenance, all without a drop in signal transmission. One technician lets me follow him to a cable station on a routine follow-up to a warning alarm. He explains that there is not a one-to-one correspondence between each alarm and an actual problem with the system. Rather, an alarm is a symptom that something is wrong—an indication of a failed connection. It could be compared to a fever or a rash on the human body: a manifestation of a problem, but not an indication of cause. A full cable break might generate many alarms. In turn, multiple problems might contribute to a single alarm.

As a result, there is a significant amount of human interpretation required to deduce the origin of a problem from an array of alarms. Cable engineers might be thought of as the doctors of the global cable network. Pointing to one rack, which has a light on, this technician says, “See… that machine is in a state of alarm.” He plugs in his computer to figure out what is wrong, but it remains unclear. He then turns to a rack from which several cords extend, plugging into another machine. He looks at the loose cords. “I think that this one here,” he says, picking up a cord, “is supposed to be in here”—he points to a jack— “but I’m not sure.” He’s not ready to risk it. This alarm is only for a backup machine, so it can wait. We leave the station, still not quite sure what the cause is, and head back to the network operations center to consult with the other technicians.

While in some ways the computers that support global networks are not so different from our personal laptops, the stakes are dramatically higher for this kind of maintenance work. The technicians aim to make every backup system, and backup-for-the-backup system, run perfectly. Much of the equipment is designed to function for 25 years, the expected life of an undersea cable, including the repeaters that sit on the bottom of the seafloor. These are some of the most durable computers out there. And yet some parts will develop bugs, and others won’t. Technicians keep detailed records on individual pieces of equipment so they know what each part’s history is. Tracking “what each one’s been through” is critical to maintaining a reliable network.

Even the smallest discordances in the network need to be addressed. One cable worker describes a problem he had with a piece of equipment that was displaying an alarm state when he looked at it in the landing station, but the alarm was not detected back at the network operations center. As a result, he could not determine where the bug was: in the piece of equipment or in the computers at the center. Even though it was at great cost, the engineer decided to send the equipment out to have its code rewritten, just in case. Even though the alarms are constant, because of this thorough labor, actual failures are few and far between.

Operating undersea networks requires this kind of careful interpretive work and a detailed knowledge of the history of cable equipment, skills that cannot be outsourced to computers. Although we might think of digital networks as purely technical, engineers and technicians are the human components in a system carrying 99 percent of transoceanic Internet traffic. If these workers were to disappear, the system would ultimately collapse. We owe the smooth operation of global communications in part to their ability to act quickly and minimize disruptions.

The level of secrecy of this job, the specialized nature of cabling, and the small number of systems, however, have kept this a fairly insular group of men. Many have been in the cable industry for decades. Even with all of this experience, though, no single person has an understanding of the entire network. In the station that I visited, new servers and stacks have been added, and the technician I interviewed was not familiar with the history of every single one. As a result, engineers depend heavily on each other to solve problems: they must know who to call for what information and how to coordinate system fixes across platforms. The insularity of the cable community supports this interpretive work.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, covering their operational status and the implications of potential damage, including severance.

A submarine robot named Hector is beginning the repairs on the SeaMeWe-3 and SeaMeWe-4, which are cables owned by a consortium of telecommunications companies and operated by France Telecom. A third cable known as FLAG is under separate ownership and operated by a unit of Reliance. The cables were cut within a few minutes of each other, sparking theories that a fishing net or anchor of a single ship cut all three.

Internet communications to the same region took a major hit in January when four underseas cables [were seriously damaged](https://www.theregister.com/2008/02/07/cut_underseas_cable_conspiracies/) in less than a week.

Until then, damage to any of the cables currently in use is likely to result in significant disruptions. ®","The article titled ""Three simultaneously cut undersea cables under repair"" provides detailed information about three undersea cables that were cut, including the circumstances of their severance and the implications for internet and voice traffic between Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.

From telephone poles suspending bundles of cable to signs posted warning of buried fiber optic lines, we are surrounded by evidence that at a basic level, the internet is really just a spaghetti-work of really long wires. But what we see is just a small part of the physical makeup of the net. The rest of it can be found in the coldest depths of the ocean. Here are 10 things you might not know about the internet’s system of undersea cables.

More than 95 percent of international data is transmitted by wires at the bottom of the ocean called submarine communications cables. In total, they are hundreds of thousands of miles long and can lie 8000 meters below the surface—as deep as Mount Everest is tall. The cables are installed by special boats called cable-layers. It’s more than a matter of dropping wires with anvils attached to them—the cables must generally be run across flat surfaces of the ocean floor, and care is taken to avoid coral reefs, sunken ships, fish beds, and other ecological habitats and general obstructions.

The diameter of a shallow water cable is about the same as a soda can, while deep water cables are much thinner—about the size of a Magic Marker. The size difference is related to simple vulnerability—there’s not much going on 8000 feet below sea level; consequently, there’s less need for galvanized shielding wire. Cables located at shallow depths are buried beneath the ocean floor using high pressure water jets. Though per-mile prices for installation change depending on total length and destination, running a cable across the ocean invariably costs hundreds of millions of dollars.

There’s disagreement as to why, exactly, sharks occasionally gnaw on submarine communications cables. Maybe it has something to do with electromagnetic fields. Maybe they’re just curious. Maybe they’re trying to disrupt our communications infrastructure before mounting a land-based assault. The point remains that sharks have been discovered chewing on the internet, and they sometimes damage it—but “fish bites” account for less than 1 percent of cable faults in the industry’s history, according to the International Cable Protection Committee. Still, companies such as Google have shielded their cables in shark-proof wrappers.

It seems like every couple of years, some well-meaning construction worker puts his bulldozer in gear and kills Netflix for the whole continent. While the ocean is free of construction equipment that might otherwise combine to form Devastator, there are many ongoing aquatic threats to the submarine cables. Sharks aside, the internet is ever at risk of being disrupted by boat anchors, trawling by fishing vessels, and natural disasters. A Toronto-based company has proposed running a cable through the Arctic that connects Tokyo and London. This was previously considered impossible, but climate change and receding ice have moved the proposal firmly into the doable-but-really-expensive category.

H.M.S. 'Agamemnon' lays the original Atlantic Telegraph cable in 1857.

In 1854, installation began on the first transatlantic telegraph cable, which connected Newfoundland and Ireland. Four years later the first transmission was sent, reading: “Laws, Whitehouse received five minutes signal. Coil signals too weak to relay. Try drive slow and regular. I have put intermediate pulley. Reply by coils.” This is, admittedly, not very inspiring. (“Whitehouse” referred to Wildman Whitehouse, the chief electrician of the Atlantic Telegraph Company.)

For historical context: During those four years of cable construction, Charles Dickens was still writing novels; Walt Whitman published Leaves of Grass; a small settlement called Dallas was formally incorporated in Texas; and Abraham Lincoln, candidate for the U.S. Senate, gave his “House Divided” speech.

During the height of the Cold War, the USSR often transmitted weakly encoded messages between two of its major naval bases. Soviet officials thought strong encryption was a bother—and also overkill—because the bases were directly linked by an undersea cable located in sensor-laden Soviet territorial waters. No way would the Americans risk World War III by trying to somehow access and tap that cable.

They didn’t count on the U.S.S. Halibut, a specially fitted submarine capable of slipping by Soviet defenses. The American submarine found the cable and installed a giant wiretap, returning monthly to gather the transmissions it had recorded. This operation, called IVY BELLS, was later compromised by a former NSA analyst named Ronald Pelton, who sold information on the mission to the Soviets. Today, tapping submarine communications cables is standard operating procedure for spy agencies.

With respect to electronic espionage, one big advantage held by the United States is the key role its scientists, engineers, and corporations played in inventing and building large parts of the global telecommunications infrastructure. Major lines of data tend to cross into American borders and territorial waters, making wiretapping a breeze, relatively speaking. When documents stolen by former NSA analyst Edward Snowden came to light, many countries were outraged to learn the extent to which American spy agencies were intercepting foreign data. As a result, some countries are reconsidering the infrastructure of the internet itself. Brazil, for example, launched a project to build a submarine communications cable to Portugal that not only bypassed the United States entirely, but also specifically excludes U.S. companies from involvement.

As of 2022, there were more than 5000 satellites in orbit. We’re landing probes on comets, we’re deflecting asteroids so they don’t collide with Earth, and we’re planning missions to Mars. We’re living in the future! It just seems self-evident that space would be a better way to virtually “wire” the internet than our current method of running really long cables along the ocean floor. Surely satellites would be better than a technology invented before the invention of the telephone—right?

As it turns out, no. Though fiber optic cables and communications satellites were both developed in the 1960s, satellites have a two-fold problem: latency and bit loss. Sending and receiving signals to and from space takes time. Meanwhile, researchers have developed optical fibers that can transmit information at 99.7 percent the speed of light. For an idea of what the internet would be like without undersea cables, visit Antarctica, the only continent without a physical connection to the net. The continent relies on satellites, and bandwidth is at a premium which is no small problem when one considers the important, data-intensive climate research underway. Today, Antarctic research stations produce more data than they can transmit through space.

Don't worry, he's actually fixing the cable.

The good news is that it’s hard to cut through a submarine communications cable due to the thousands of very lethal volts running through each of them. The bad news is that it is possible, as seen in Egypt in 2013.","The article provides extensive information about undersea cables, discussing their importance, threats they face, and specific incidents of damage, including a reference to a cable cut in Egypt in 2013.

It uses terms like 'submarine communications cables' and addresses the implications of these cables being cut, particularly in relation to internet connectivity.

Therefore, it meets the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables."
"Ship's Anchor Cuts Mideast Internet Cable","Disruption of internet traffic affecting multiple cables, including FALCON, due to a ship's anchor; expert analysis on incident frequency and conspiracy theories.","http://edition.cnn.com/2008/TECH/02/08/internet.outage","","",Yes,-,"New York, NY, USA","50000","2023-02-27","English","CNN","**Firm: Ship's anchor cut Mideast Internet cable**  
(CNN) -- A telecommunications company on Friday blamed a ship anchor for cutting one of three severed undersea cables that snarled Internet traffic throughout the Middle East last week.  
FLAG Telecom blamed the slicing of its Persian Gulf cable on this abandoned six-ton ship anchor.  
FLAG Telecom's FALCON cable spanning Dubai and Oman was snapped February 1 by an abandoned six-ton ship anchor, the company said, and will be repaired by Sunday.  
The cut cables linking the Mideast not only fouled up communications, but they also provided prime fodder for Web-based conspiracy theorists around the world.  
""Fundamentally, if somebody wants to cut a cable, they can do so -- all you need to do is go trawling with an anchor,"" said Stephan Beckert an analyst with TeleGeography, a research company that consults on global Internet issues. He scoffed at conspiracy theories posted online by what he calls ""the tin-foil hat crowd.""  
FLAG said Friday that its severed Europe-Asia Internet cable in the Mediterranean Sea that links Egypt and Italy also would be repaired by Sunday.  
A third cut cable, called SeaMeWe-4, lies just a few hundred meters from FLAG's Europe-Asia line. It's co-owned by France Telecom and is expected to be back in working order soon, said Beckert.  
The question is, who would have incentive to cut underwater Internet cables? That wild speculation, Beckert said, ""just doesn't make a lot of sense.""  
Theories that the U.S. government was behind the cable cuts to create an information blackout for whatever reason are ridiculous, Beckert said.  
""The U.S. military uses those cables,"" he said, ""they would find it quite inconvenient,"" although Beckert added that the military also uses satellites to run communication traffic as a secondary route.  
Another target of the Internet sabotage speculation is Islamic terrorists. ""It was a six-ton anchor that took out that cable in the Persian Gulf. Unless al Qaeda has extremely strong frogmen or submarines, I'm not sure how they did it,"" laughed Beckert.  
Scores of cut undersea cables are reported each year, Beckert said, acknowledging that three cables leading into the volatile Middle East would attract more attention.  
A fourth cable, known as the Qatar-UAE Submarine Cable System, which links United Arab Emirates to Qatar went down last weekend, but that failure was blamed on a power outage, Beckert said. Like most cable outages, the incident went largely unnoticed by end users because Internet traffic can easily be re-routed through other cables, he said.  
As the world's fleet of 28 multimillion-dollar cable repair ships works to maintain the crisscrossing communications spider web, Beckert said more capacity is needed in the Persian Gulf to satisfy increasing numbers of Internet users.  
Some undersea Internet cables can cost $500 million to lay, Beckert said, although the expense is shrinking. It still takes a lot of time to stretch communication lines thousands of miles across entire oceans.  
Following last week's outages, Internet Service Providers in India were alerting customers to service slowdowns of 50 percent to 60 percent, according to the Internet Services Providers Association of India. Service was back to normal by this week.  
Although last week's problem created a ""big pain"" for many of carriers, Beckert said, it didn't compare to the several months of disruption in East Asia in 2006 after an earthquake damaged seven undersea cables near Taiwan.  
TeleGeography analysts said a similar Internet problem could not happen in the United States because most traffic between the United States, Canada and Mexico is carried over land, and there is a plentiful supply of undersea cables carrying traffic under the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.","The article titled 'Firm: Ship's anchor cut Mideast Internet cable' provides a detailed account of incidents involving cut undersea cables, specifically mentioning the FALCON cable and two others in the Middle East.

It discusses the cause of these cuts, attributed to a ship anchor, and the resulting disruptions to internet traffic.

The article includes insights from an analyst who discusses the frequency of such incidents and dismisses conspiracy theories about intentional sabotage.

Key phrases such as 'cut undersea cables' and 'severed cables' are used, confirming that the topic is treated as a central theme rather than a minor mention.

"Vietnam's Internet Connectivity Threatened by Subsea Cable Issues","Four out of five subsea cables disrupted; AAE-1 lost data flow on November 24, AAG completely lost signals, causing widespread internet service issues.","https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-s-internet-infrastructure-hangs-by-a-thin-thread-4569266.html","","Luu Quy, Thu Hang",Yes,"Luu Quy, Thu Hang","Hanoi, Vietnam","1018491809","2023-02-11","Vietnamese","VnExpress","**Vietnam's internet infrastructure hangs by a thin thread**  
A subsea cable that’s about to be decommissioned is now the only fully functional pathway that connects Vietnam’s internet with the rest of the world.  

Out of the five subsea cables that connect Vietnam with the rest of the globe, the SMW-3 has been around the longest. Expecting to be decommissioned in 2024, the soon-to-retire cable is now the only fully operational pathway that holds Vietnam’s international internet connection together for 70 million users.

This is the second time in the last 24 years of operation that the SMW-3 has found itself in the same situation. The first time was in 2007, when one of Vietnam’s two cables at the time was surreptitiously sabotaged. And this time, four out of the five available cables encountered issues all at once.

The problem is not solely because the cables are not working properly. It's also because of the sheer number of internet users and their ever-rising demands for internet access. Some 16 years ago, there were only around 17.7 million internet users in Vietnam. Today, that number has already quadrupled.

Over the past three months, the four cables have encountered issues one after another, partially or fully disabling internet connections running through them.

The first one to have trouble was the AAE-1, which lost the data flow en-route towards Hong Kong on November 24 last year. Seventeen days later, the AAG completely lost all signals.  

The APG, the cable carrying the most bandwidths, lost signals running towards Malaysia and Singapore on January 21. A week after, the IA lost its connection with Singapore.

No matter what happens, the SMW-3 will be abandoned after 25 years of operation as planned.

""Poor old SMW3 ([Ready For Service in 1999], about to be decommissioned) is bearing [Vietnam's] international traffic alone,"" Twitter account philBE, which described itself as an observer of global submarine cable systems developments, tweeted on February 3.

Vu Nhat An, the tech director of a startup based in Hanoi’s Thanh Xuan District, said that if the SMW-3 had entered operation just a year sooner, Vietnam would ""probably have no undersea cables left right now.""

**Sluggish, fickle**

""I have never been as frustrated with our internet connection as I am today,"" said An, adding that he has been dealing with sluggish and unstable internet access for the last two months.

An’s company is currently using four internet connection routes, but the team could never achieve peak efficiency with such a fickle internet network. Even the most basic things, like using Google Docs, sometimes fail. When he gets home, An switches off Wi-Fi and turns to his 4G connection instead.

As someone who manages a digital platform with over 3 million monthly visitors, An said more and more people have been complaining to the platform’s customer service over the past month.

""Some people did not know that the slow internet was because of damaged cables,"" he said. ""They thought that the website was faulty, and so they filed complaints.""

Internet users like An, which account for two-thirds of Vietnam's total population, now have to compete with one another over an ever-shrinking internet bandwidth. A _VnExpress_ survey from January 30 to February 6 of over 13,900 respondents revealed that 95% of them reported slower internet connections than usual.

The fact that Vietnam has around 70,000 businesses dealing with digital technologies, along with another million companies utilizing technologies for their daily operations, means that internet access has evolved from being a luxury to being a necessity. Any internet issues would therefore cause consequences that businesses have to deal with themselves.

Yet no one has ever brought up the question of who should be held accountable for such consequences.

The Vietnam Internet Association said that internet connections to the outside world ""might need to take longer trips"" now that several cables have been damaged.

""The quality of internet connections for the next few weeks will be unstable and slow for certain services,"" said Vu The Binh, general secretary of the association. ""Internet service providers will need time to compensate for the lost data, as well as to reroute connections, which would result in slower internet access.""

**A thin thread**  

During its heyday, Vietnam's internet speed was a bright spot on the global internet map. Speedtest recorded Vietnam's fixed broadband internet speed to be at 82 Mb/s back in December last year, which ranked 46th among 180 countries and territories. The country's mobile internet speed was at 42 Mb/s, placing it at No. 51.

The problem with Vietnam's internet connection has nothing to do with its actual capabilities. The problem is its insufficient capacity to respond and adapt to emergency situations.

There are three ways through which Vietnam's internet network connects with the rest of the world: subsea cables, land cables and satellites. Among them, subsea cables have always been the lifeblood of international internet connections, accounting for 99% of inter-continental data flows. Land cables are usually reserved for people with high demands for internet access, who pay to utilize them for their own purposes. Satellite internet is only used for very remote areas where cables cannot easily reach.

Vietnam knows the significant role that its internet infrastructure plays in the country's development. So for the past three decades, the country has worked tirelessly to increase the number of cables and the amount of bandwidth in order to meet the needs of the growing number of internet users.

But the cables, despite all the protective layers they could wear, could not withstand all the hardships underneath the sea.

The South China Sea, which Vietnam calls the East Sea, is one of the most active sea regions for maritime activities in the world. Subsea cables, even with all their steel reinforcements, are no match for anchors tolled by vessels that weigh dozens of thousands of tons.

Statistics from the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) revealed that from 1959 to 2021, 41% of cases where cables were damaged resulted from fishing activities, 16% were due to anchors, and 0.1% were due to marine creatures.

By early 2023, the world had 552 cables which are either already operating or about to. Every year, this cable network encounters around 100 issues, according to telecommunications market research company TeleGeography. Another report by state-owned Viettel said that Vietnam's subsea cables encounter issues around 10 times a year on average.

It means that with five cables currently available, Vietnam utilizes only 1% of all the cables on the globe, yet the issues they encounter account for 10% of all cable issues in the world.

A representative from military-run telecom giant Viettel said that one possible explanation for why Vietnam's cables encounter so many issues is because the water at the country's southeastern sea region is too shallow, and there are many vessels operating in areas where the cables are installed.

These cables are easy to damage and hard to fix due to the fact that Vietnam's internet service providers cannot play an active role in the reparation process. It's been three months since the first cable encountered problems, yet reparation has only been scheduled for two cables, either in March or April. As for the other two damaged cables, no reparation schedule has been planned.

All five of Vietnam's cables belong to consortiums, which are managed by several countries and telecommunications firms. These cables all span wide areas of the ocean, meaning fixing them cannot be done in a short time, and the reparation process is out of Vietnam's control. There is practically nothing that Vietnam 's internet service providers can do to speed up this process.

Viettel said that with the frequency of issues happening 10 times a year on average, along with the fact that each issue would take around a month to fix, service providers are often only able to make use of three cables at a time at most. That means service providers always have to maintain backup internet connection routes, leading to cost inefficiency and a greater operational burden. This is considered one of the biggest thorns in the side of Vietnam's subsea cable network at the moment.

""There is not enough subsea cable infrastructure right now,"" a representative of a major Vietnamese internet service provider admitted, adding that when problems occur, businesses would often rely on land cable networks that connect Vietnam’s northern and southwestern regions. As this network is usually reserved for private channels and 3G and 4G connections, several users often report better internet service quality on their mobile phones.

**Internet autonomy**

For over two decades now, Vietnam has been devising multiple solutions to upgrade its internet infrastructure amid an exponentially growing internet user population, from 1.9 million users in 2002 to 72.1 million today. That's a 38-fold increase and a number that Vietnam's cables have yet to keep up with.

If the two subsea cables that have yet to officially be put into operation, the ADC and the SJC2, are added to the mix, Vietnam would have seven cables in total to connect itself to the world. But that number still pales to many other countries, for example, Singapore's 39 cables, Malaysia's 25 cables, the Philippines' 24 cables and Thailand's 13 cables. Meanwhile, the num","The article discusses Vietnam's internet infrastructure, specifically focusing on the issues surrounding subsea cables.

It mentions that four out of five cables connecting Vietnam faced problems, leading to significant disruptions in internet service.

Specific incidents are detailed, such as the AAE-1 losing data flow on November 24 and the AAG completely losing signals shortly thereafter.

The article explains the implications of these cable issues, describing the frustrations of users and the impact on businesses, emphasizing that the internet issues are due to damaged cables and the inability to quickly repair them.

It centers on the significance of subsea cables in maintaining Vietnam's internet connectivity and discusses the consequences of their failure on communication and internet access.

"Update on Asian Undersea Cable Disruption","Disruption in APCN2 causing 30% slowdown in internet traffic between China and Taiwan, affecting connectivity for millions in Southeast Asia.","https://www.computerworld.com/article/2526855/update--asian-undersea-cable-disruption-slows-internet-access.html","","Sumner Lemon",Yes,"Sumner Lemon","Framingham, Massachusetts, United States","150000","2023-02-06","English","Computerworld","A segment of the Asia-Pacific Cable Network 2 (APCN2) undersea cable network between China and Taiwan suffered a serious cable fault on Wednesday, causing Internet traffic to be rerouted onto other undersea cables and slowing Internet access for some users in Southeast Asia.

At about 10:50 a.m. on Wednesday, local time, an alarm signaled a cable fault on Segment 7 of APCN2, which connects Hong Kong and Shantou, China. The disruption caused a temporary loss of service on the undersea link but all customers that use the cable were soon shifted to capacity on other cables, according to a source familiar with the situation.

The APCN2 cable is owned by a consortium of 26 telecom operators from 14 different countries. The cable links Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, South Korea, and Japan.

The exact cause of the APCN2 fault was not immediately known. The alarm indicated the disruption was caused by a ""single point of failure,"" which suggests a variety of possibilities, including a technical failure or a cable cut, the source said.

The incident was likely the main reason that Internet access appeared slower for some users in Singapore on Wednesday, the source said.

Undersea cables are used to transport much of the world's Internet traffic and can be easily damaged by natural disasters or other causes. In 2006, a powerful earthquake off the southern coast of Taiwan damaged several cables and slowed Internet access to a crawl for users in Southeast Asia.

Singapore Telecommunications (SingTel), which is an investor in APCN2, said its users may experience slower Internet access than normal to some U.S. Web sites, blaming the APCN2 fault on damage caused by Typhoon Morakot.

""The [APCN2] consortium members have started restoration works, and our engineers are in the process of diverting Internet traffic to other cable systems. We expect the situation to return to acceptable levels within the next 24 hours,"" SingTel spokesman Chia Boon Chong said in an e-mail statement.

A spokesman for Starhub, another Singapore ISP that holds a stake in the cable, did not return a phone call seeking comment.

The fault that hit APCN2 on Wednesday follows two other service disruptions that recently hit the network. One disruption affected APCN2 Segment 7, between Hong Kong and Taiwan, and the other affected APCN2 Segment 1, which connects Singapore and Malaysia. However, both of these disruptions were deemed to be ""relatively minor"" compared to the disruption that took place Wednesday morning, the source said.

The cause of the two earlier faults on APCN2 was not immediately clear.

APCN2 isn't the only Asian undersea cable currently suffering from a service disruption.

""The Cable & Wireless Real Time Operations Team have logged multiple cable breaks on APCN2, APCN, EAC, and SMW3 in Asia Pacific -- specifically, near Taiwan. Network traffic flow has been adversely affected in and out of the region as a result,"" said Gavin Tait, director of Asia network planning and implementation at Cable & Wireless, in an e-mail statement provided by the company.

None of Cable & Wireless customers were affected by these failures, he said.

Efforts are currently underway to repair the East Asia Crossing (EAC) undersea cable after it experienced ""double faults"" off the coast of Taiwan last weekend, according to Roland Lim, a spokesman for Pacnet, which owns EAC.

The first sign of damage to the EAC cable off the coast of Taiwan came on Aug. 9 at 1:37 a.m., local time, when an alarm signalled that service on EAC Segment D, which links Taiwan and Hong Kong, had been disrupted. At the time, traffic on Segment D was transferred to EAC Segment C. However, Segment C suffered a second disruption roughly twelve hours later.

The cause of the faults that hit the EAC cable between Hong Kong and Taiwan is not yet known, but the damage happened at about the same time the southern part of the island and China's southern coast was being pummeled by one of the most powerful typhoons to strike in recent memory. There were no earthquakes recorded by Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau at the time when the disruptions took place.","The article discusses a significant disruption in the Asia-Pacific Cable Network 2 (APCN2), specifically mentioning a cable fault that affected internet traffic between China and Taiwan.

It directly mentions 'undersea cable' and 'cable cut', elaborates on the implications of the disruption, and discusses the impact on internet connectivity for users in Southeast Asia.

The central theme of the article revolves around this incident, demonstrating a clear focus on the topic of cut sea cables."

UPDATE ON UNDERWATER SALVAGE DIVING EXPEDITION TO RECOVER A PIECE OF VERY EARLY SUBMARINE TELEGRAPH CABLE

I have always been fascinated by the early transatlantic telegraph cables which linked, for the very first time, Europe and the United States beginning in 1858. Here is a picture of one of the original ships laying the cable. and here is another picture of the laying of the cable. As you can imagine, this was an absolutely incredible undertaking at the time and it allowed nearly instantaneous communication between the United States and Europe instead of the several-week delay necessitated by using ships to carry the messages.

For a number of years I have been interested in trying to locate and recover some of these very early cables from the depths of the Atlantic ocean. This is a report on this year's expedition:

With visions of beautiful, calm, sailing as shown in this photograph, I chartered this TICON 34 sailboat and invited my long-time friend George Ward to join me. As you can see, the boat has unusual unstayed masts but it is a good stable boat for diving. The cable section that I chose to collect was located about 11 miles off the coast and, although not a Transatlantic Cable, it was one of the cables laid between the United States and Havana, Cuba during the time period starting in 1866 and lasting into the early 1900s. It was similar in design and made by the same company that manufactured the transatlantic cables and I knew that it would provide me with information about how well these early cables survived after about 100 years on the floor of the ocean.

Several of the more pessimistic telegraph key collectors that I discussed my plans with suggested that I would probably cut an active cable and summarily deprive some South American country of the Information Age.. so I was a bit hesitant when I cut through the center conductor...

I have carefully watched the newspapers and no International Incident has been reported and War does not seem to have been declared against the United States... So I conclude that I did not cut an active cable... Also, the cables that I found dated from 1866 to the early 1900s. They were clearly recorded as having been abandoned, and I was certain that they were not in use.

As I put on my diving gear, I clipped on a hacksaw with a carbide blade to cut into the steel casing since the metal in the submaring telegraph cable seemed to have crystalized and was instantly dulling the teeth of the conventional hacksaw blades that I had tried using last year. When I got down to the cable, I was greeted by this fish that did not seem very happy to see me.. The cable was heavily covered with coral and I could see places where it was starting to disintegrate and rust under the coral. As soon as I cut it, the thick steel outer wires started to unwind but, luckily it did not continue to unwind. The second cut did not unwind at all since it was not under any tension strain.

I used up all 3300 lbs of air in my tank during only 29 minutes of cutting twice through the cable. I had never used that much air in that short a time in over 40 years of diving! That much air usually lasts for about 1.2 hours under normal conditions! I had not realized that hacksawing underwater could be so incredibly strenuous. I had a 20 cf pony air bottle with me to allow safe completion of the dive...

I got a little bit greedy and just couldn't resist taking a pretty big piece. I had to use air-filled lift bags to help me get the extremely heavy cable to the surface, and doing it on a solo dive meant that I had to think out the recovery pretty carefully. Over 90% of my diving has been solo over the years since obviously, it is hard to find anyone else crazy enough to be interested in the kind of underwater adventures that I enjoy... This picture shows how happy I was to have been able to cut and raise the cable.

I haven't had time to analyze it yet but it will be interesting to see what the electrical characteristics of the cable are after many years under the ocean. I will be measuring the insulation resistance and the capacitance-per-foot of the cable when I get it stabilized.

I cut the cable into shorter pieces and stored it wet as I prepared to do the electrolysis that I understood was necessary to stabilize and conserve the steel. Apparently the salt from the ocean gradually finds its way into the metal over a period of many years and when the metal dries out, I am told that the embedded salt crystals expand and gradually cause the metal to disintegrate. I had this happen to a lovely cannon ball that I found. One year it was a great cannon ball and the next year it was a pile of rust powder. I hoped to avoid having this happen to the telegraph cable!

Following suggestions from ""Cleaning & Stabilizing Metal Artifacts by Means of Electrolysis and Protective Coatings"" published by the Florida Division of Historical Resources, I planned to use a sodium bicarbonate electrolyte solution and to place the cable at the cathode end of the circuit. I planned to use a stainless steel anode simply immersed in the electrolyte. I have been told that the process may take as long as 6 months or a year.

When I unwrapped and looked at the cable with its heavy outer wrap of steel wires, they already showed early signs of disintegration... so I put the cable in its electrolyte bath in the basement, turned on the 12VDC and noted that it was drawing about 3 Amps and bubbling happily.

You would not believe the smell that the cable gave off! It was sort of like a combination of really rotten fish and the worst smells from all of the world's garbage dumps combined. I expected some smell from my past experiences with drying out coral and cannon balls but the electrolysis seemed to actually COOK this mess and worsened the odors !!

After 4 months, I removed the cable from the electrolytic bath and applied a thin layer of clear varnish to seal out moisture and eliminate the chance of further deterioration. I displayed pieces of the cable At the September - 1997 Antique Wireless Association meet in Rochester, NY., and made sections of the cable available to serious collectors and museums.

Here is an outside view of a piece of cable: showing some of the coral growths which I left on one of the cable sections. Here is a closer view of the marine growths on the outside of the cable: Here is a view of one end of a cable piece: Here is a view of another end of a cable piece: I have dissected the cable and photographed each of the layers. I have combined all of the pictures into one LARGE - SLOW LOADING page which allows you to see all of the layers in one display. MULTIPLE PHOTOGRAPH PAGE SHOWING ALL OF THE LAYERS OF THE CABLE: Click here to view all of the cable layers:

In the future, I plan to add information about the electrical characteristics of this cable. I will also update these pages as I try to recover all six of the underwater cables. They will provide samples of the technological improvements in cables from 1866 to the 1900's and allow me to analyze how well they have survived over 100 years under the ocean.

Electrical repairs on the ocean floor.

_Four undersea telecom cables have broken in the past week, cutting off or severely slowing Internet traffic in countries along the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf. In an “Explainer” column first published last year and reprinted below, Lindsay Goldwert looked into how exactly they fix cables thousands of miles long and located thousands of feet under the waves._

Powerful earthquakes near Taiwan shut off international phone and Internet service for the Far East just after Christmas. Five repair ships have been working on the damaged undersea cables since late last week. How do you repair a cable that’s lying across the ocean floor?

Drag it to the surface. Earthquakes—like ships’ anchors and fishing trawls—can cause undersea fiber-optic cables to malfunction or break many miles below the surface of the water. When this happens, a telecom operator has to find the location of the accident, hoist up the damaged part, and replace it with a new stretch of cable.

First, the telecom operator has to locate the part of the cable that’s no longer working. Cable engineers can figure out the general neighborhood of the problem based on the reported phone or Internet service outages. From terminal stations on shore, they can zero in on more specific coordinates by sending light pulses along the fibers in the cable. A working fiber will transmit those pulses all the way across the ocean, but a broken one will bounce it back from the site of the damage. By measuring the time it takes for the reflections to come back, the engineers can figure out where along the cable they have a problem.

Once they know that, the company can send out a large cable ship with a few miles of fresh fiber-optic lines on board to make the repairs. If the faulty part of the cable is less than about 6,500 feet down, the crew will send out a submersible tanklike robot that can move around on the sea floor. A signal can be sent through the cable to guide the robot toward the problem spot. When the robot finds the right place, it grabs ahold of the cable, cuts out the nonworking section, and pulls the loose ends back up to the ship.

The robot doesn’t work in very deep water (with very high pressure). In those situations, the technicians aboard the cable ship use a grapnel, or a hook on a very long wire, to snatch up the cable from the sea floor. The grapnel uses a mechanical cutting and gripping device that can split the cable on both sides of the break and drag the loose ends to the surface. One end is hooked onto a buoy so it won’t sink, and the other is hauled on board.

The malfunctioning cable section can be fixed onboard the ship. A skilled technician or “jointer” splices the glass fibers and uses powerful adhesives to attach the new section of cable to each cut end of the original—a process that can take up to 16 hours. The repaired cable is then lowered back to the seabed on ropes.

"Finger-thin Undersea Cables Connecting the World","Details on the disruption of communications across the Middle East and India due to the cutting of FLAG Europe Asia and SEA-ME-WE 4 cables, emphasizing the impact on global internet connectivity.","https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna22938899","","By By Peter Svensson",Yes,"Peter Svensson","30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, NY 10112, USA",-,"2008-01-31","English","NBC News","The lines that tie the globe together by carrying phone calls and Internet traffic are just two-thirds of an inch thick where they lie on the ocean floor.

The foundation for a connected world seems quite fragile, an impression reinforced this week when a break in two cables in the Mediterranean Sea disrupted communications across the Middle East and into India and neighboring countries.

Yet the network itself is fairly resilient. In fact, cables are broken all the time, usually by fishing lines and ship anchors, and few of us notice. It takes a confluence of factors for a cable break to cause an outage.

""Most telecom companies have capacity at multiple systems, so if one goes out, they simply reroute to a different system,"" said Stephan Beckert, analyst at research firm TeleGeography in Washington. ""It's just that in this case, both the main route and the backup route got cut for a lot of companies.""

The two cables — FLAG Europe Asia and SEA-ME-WE 4 — were cut on the ocean floor just north of Alexandria, Egypt.

By an accident of geography and global politics, Egypt is a choke point in the global communications network, just as it is with global shipping. The reasons are the same: The country touches both the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, which flows into the India Ocean.

The slim fiber-optic cables that carry the world's communications are much like ships, in that they're the cheapest way for carrying things over long distances. Pulling cable overland is much more expensive and requires negotiation with landowners and governments.

So fiber-optic cables that go from Europe to India take the sea route via Egypt's Suez Canal, just as ships do.

Map shows damaged undersea cables off the coast of Egypt; 2c x 3 1/8 inches; 96.3 mm x 79.4 mmPete Santilli / AP

Another Mediterranean cable makes land not far away, in Israel.

But there's no cable overland from Israel into Jordan and to the Persian Gulf, which could have provided a redundant connection for the Gulf States and India. Going overland would have been more expensive and politically difficult — Israel and Arab countries would have to cooperate.

There is also no route that goes through Russia, Iran and Pakistan to India. The terrain is rugged, Pakistan is politically unstable, and India and Pakistan are not on good terms.

With two of the three cables passing through Suez cut, traffic from the Middle East and India intended for Europe was forced to route eastward, around most of the globe.

The main route goes through Japan and the United States, crossing both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. According to Beckert, this is normally the cheap way to go for Indian traffic, since capacity is high. However, the distance means more time required to reach Europe and get a response.

The other route from India to Europe goes over China into Russia and along the Trans-Siberian railroad.

Egypt is not the only check point in the global network. The ocean just south of Taiwan proved to be one in December 2006, when an earthquake cut seven of eight cables passing through the area, slowing down communications in Hong Kong and other parts of Asia for months.

Another possible vulnerability is the U.S. island of Guam in the Pacific Ocean. It is the spider at the center of a web of cables from the United States, Japan, Australia, the Philippines and China.

Both cables that connect the United States to Australia and New Zealand run over Hawaii, creating another choke point.

These bottlenecks are likely to go away, however, as telecoms build more and more lines. Another U.S.-Australia line is scheduled to be completed soon, according to Beckert, and a U.S.-China line that bypasses Japan is also in the works.

But it will be years before the network across Asia is as resilient as the trans-Atlantic network, where multiple high-capacity lines over different routes provide a connection that's almost impossible to disrupt. And the factors that make the Suez Canal a vulnerable point now will likely remain.

Mustafa Alani, head of the security and terrorism department at the Dubai-based Gulf Research Center, said the outage should be a ""wake-up call"" for governments and professionals to divert more resources to protect vital infrastructure.

""This shows how easy it would be to attack"" communications networks, he said.

Yet the owners of the undersea cables aren't very concerned with terrorism, according to Beckert. They're too busy worrying about fishing boats.

""They want to publish maps of their cables as widely as possible, so fishing crews know where they are,"" Beckert said. ""The risk of accidental cuts is much, much greater than the risk of deliberate cuts.","The article titled ""Finger-thin undersea cables tie world together"" discusses the topic of cut sea cables in detail.

It directly mentions a specific incident where two undersea cables, FLAG Europe Asia and SEA-ME-WE 4, were cut in the Mediterranean Sea, which disrupted communications across the Middle East and into India.

The article elaborates on the implications of these cuts for global internet connectivity, indicating that such incidents can significantly affect telecommunications.

It also discusses the resilience of the cable network and the reasons behind cable cuts, such as fishing lines and ship anchors.

Damage to [submarine cables](https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/25/asia/internet-undersea-cables-intl-hnk/index.html) in the Red Sea is disrupting telecommunications networks and forcing providers to reroute as much as a quarter of traffic between Asia, Europe and the Middle East, including internet traffic.

Cables belonging to four major telecoms networks have been “cut” causing “significant” disruption to communications networks in the Middle East, [according](https://www.hgc.com.hk/press-releases/statement-hgc-global-communications-takes-swift-action-in-response-to-submarine-cable-damage-in-the-red-sea) to Hong Kong telecoms company HGC Global Communications.

HGC estimates that 25% of traffic between Asia and Europe as well the Middle East has been impacted, it said in a [statement](https://www.hgc.com.hk/press-releases/statement-supplementary-information-of-hgc-global-communications-regarding-submarine-cable-damage-in-the-red-sea-to-demonstrate-hong-kong-as-international-telecommunication-hub-to-demonstrate-hong-kong-as-international-telecommunication-hub) Monday.

The company said it is rerouting traffic to minimize disruption for customers and also “extending assistance to affected businesses.”

HGC did not say how the cables had been damaged or who was responsible.

South Africa-based Seacom, which owns one of the cable systems affected, told CNN that repairs wouldn’t begin for at least another month, partly because of the length of time it takes to secure permits to operate in the area.

Underwater cables are the invisible force driving the internet, with many [funded](https://blog.telegeography.com/rising-tide-content-providers-investment-in-submarine-cables-continues) in recent years by internet giants such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook parent Meta. Damage to these subsea networks can cause widespread internet outages, as happened following the Taiwan earthquake in 2006.

The destruction of cables in the Red Sea comes weeks after the official Yemeni government warned of the possibility that Houthi rebels would target the cables. The Iranian-backed militants have already [disrupted global supply chains](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/08/business/red-sea-crisis-global-trade-explained/index.html) by attacking commercial vessels in the crucial waterway.

Reports last week from Israeli news outlet Globes suggested the Houthis had been behind the damage to the cables. Yemeni rebel leader Abdel Malek al-Houthi denied the allegations. “We have no intention of targeting sea cables providing internet to countries in the region,” he said.

The Houthis have since blamed British and US military units operating in the area for the damage, according to a report Saturday by the rebels’ official news agency. CNN has contacted the UK and US governments for comment.

Seacom’s chief digital officer Prenesh Padayachee said acquiring permits from the Yemeni maritime authority to repair the cables could take up to eight weeks. “Client traffic will continue to be rerouted until we are able to repair the damaged cable,” he added.

Among the other networks affected is Asia-Africa-Europe 1, a 25,000-kilometer (15,534-mile) cable system connecting South East Asia to Europe via Egypt. The Europe India Gateway (EIG) has also been damaged.

EIG connects Europe, the Middle East and India and counts Vodafone as a major investor. Vodafone, a large mobile network operator in the United Kingdom, declined to comment.

The company says on its [website](https://www.vodafone.com/business/wholesale-services/connectivity/submarine-terrestrial-cable) that it can send internet traffic across some 80 submarine cable systems that reach 100 countries.

Most large telecoms companies rely on multiple undersea cable systems, allowing them to reroute traffic in the event of an outage to ensure uninterrupted service.

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly attributed the accusation that British and US military units were to blame for the damage to the cables.

FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) — When vandals sliced a fiber-optic cable in the Arizona desert last month, they did more than time-warp thousands of people back to an era before computers, credit cards or even phones. They exposed a glaring vulnerability in the nation's Internet infrastructure: no backup systems in many places.

Because Internet service is largely unregulated by the federal government and the states, decisions about network reliability are left to the service providers. Industry analysts say these companies generally do not build alternative routes, or redundancies, unless they believe it is worthwhile financially.

The result: While most major metropolitan areas in the U.S. have backup systems, some smaller cities and many rural areas do not.

""The more rural the location, the more likely that there's only one road in and out of that location,"" said Sean Donelan, a former infrastructure security manager in the U.S. Homeland Security Department who now works for a cybersecurity firm. ""If someone manages to cut that fiber, you'll generally see a one- or two- or three-day outage.""

Despite its own warnings about such vulnerabilities two decades ago, the federal government has taken no steps to require Internet companies to have backup systems, even as it has provided billions of dollars in subsidies to expand broadband Internet into unserved areas.

""Our first responsibility is to make sure that people actually have service,"" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, co-chairman of President Barack Obama's newly created Broadband Opportunity Council.

In northern Arizona last month, tens of thousands of residents were without Internet service — some for up to 15 hours — after vandals cut through an underground bundle of fiber-optic cables owned by CenturyLink. ATMs went down, stores couldn't process credit cards, college students in Flagstaff had to put their research on hold, and even 911 emergency service was lost.

Earlier this month, several thousand people lost Internet and phone service for half a day when an electric company crew accidentally cut a fiber-optic line in northern New Mexico.

When an underwater fiber-optic cable became wrapped around a big rock and broke in 2013, some residents of Washington state's San Juan Islands were without Internet and telephone service for 10 days.

Among them was aerospace consultant Mike Loucks, who said he was shocked to find out his home phone, cellphone and Internet service did not work independently of each other. All went down because they relied on the same cable. He ended up taking a ferry to the mainland to dial in to conference calls from his car outside a McDonald's.

""When I figured out what all had been routed to this cable, it's a single-point failure thing,"" he said. ""That's pretty dumb. Why don't you guys have a backup cable?""

He was so frustrated that he switched Internet providers.

CenturyLink, the broadband provider in the Arizona and Washington outages, declined to make officials available for an interview about its Internet infrastructure. But spokeswoman Linda Johnson said in an email that the company acts quickly to restore service and ""is constantly investing in its local network and strives to deliver new services and build redundancy where possible.""

After the San Juan Islands outage, CenturyLink spent $500,000 to install a microwave system that now backs up the underwater cable. A microwave system is wireless technology that relies on a series of above-ground antennas or towers to transmit data. It's more often used in rural areas.

Companies have been deploying more than 10 million miles of fiber annually in the U.S., increasing the risk of damage from backhoes, trench-diggers and shovels, according to an analysis by a network reliability committee of the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions. The number of outages on high-capacity fiber-optic lines in the U.S. more than doubled from 221 in 2010 to 487 last year, according to the Federal Communications Commission.

Fiber-optic cables form the spine of the Internet. A fiber bundle contains dozens of tiny glass fibers — each about the width of a human hair — that use light waves to transmit data. The fibers often are buried along existing rights of way for highways, railroads or pipelines. It is common for a telecommunications company to install the cables and then lease space on them to others.

That saves money for everyone involved. But it also means outages can affect a wide variety of services.

As early as 1995, the U.S. Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology warned that the ""power of optical fiber technology is diminishing the number of geographic transmission routes,"" concentrating the flow of information and ""resulting in an increase in network vulnerability.""

Since 2009, the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce departments have provided about $10 billion in grants and loans to expand broadband Internet access. The departments said recipients were encouraged but not required to build redundancies into their projects.

The FCC says about half the rural U.S. lacks access to high-speed Internet service. It plans to distribute about $20 billion over the next five years to support rural broadband. It does not require recipients to build network backup systems against outages.

The funding ""is designed to expand broadband to as many rural Americans as possible while not increasing the cost of the program"" to customers, FCC spokesman Mark Wigfield said.

The FCC recently increased its oversight of Internet providers by classifying them as ""telecommunications services"" that must operate in the public interest. But that doesn't carry any new mandate for Internet network redundancies, because such backups aren't required of phone companies, he said.

Some states have laws specifically barring the regulation of Internet service, and it's outside the jurisdiction of many state utility regulatory agencies.

Washington state Rep. Jeff Morris, who represents the San Juan Islands and is chairman of the House Technology and Economic Development Committee, said lawmakers are hesitant to require redundant lines for fear they will lead to higher Internet and phone bills for their constituents. His colleagues have discussed taxing access to Internet services, but that is prohibited by federal law.

""It really spoils our ability to generate revenue to give better service and reliability to our constituents,"" he said.

Some state officials are nonetheless trying to nudge Internet providers to develop backup plans.

""Dependability is premier to the Internet these days,"" said Sandy Jones, a member of New Mexico's Public Regulation Commission. ""Redundancy — two paths out, three paths out — is really critical for businesses. Just think of restaurants, gas stations, all the things that shut down when there's no Internet line.""","The article discusses various incidents of Internet outages, including a specific case where vandals cut a fiber-optic cable in Arizona and a significant mention of an underwater fiber-optic cable that broke, impacting residents of the San Juan Islands for 10 days.

This incident demonstrates the effects of cut cables on internet connectivity and highlights vulnerabilities in broadband infrastructure.

The underwater cable incident is treated with importance, indicating that it is not just a minor mention but is relevant to the central theme of the article regarding the implications of such outages.

Therefore, the article satisfies the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables."

Sensitive data remains safe as long as undersea cables are in good physical condition, but events such as severe sabotage—in the form of cutting cables—could leak data and interrupt vital international communications. Today, when events that damage or cut a cable, (including acts of sabotage) happen in international waters, there is no effective regime to hold the perpetrator of a physical attack accountable.

The United States and its allies and partners have come to understand how important it is to secure the world’s undersea cables. But there haven’t yet been enough efforts that incorporate all countries in a protection pact. The reality is that cable cutting could severely impact the lives of citizens in countries across the globe, from Tonga to Norway and far beyond. Thus, intergovernmental organizations such as the United Nations (UN) must take undersea cable security seriously, including by forming internationally recognized and formalized protections.

#### Risks are growing under the sea

Threats to undersea cables are increasing. For example, Russia is well positioned to conduct malicious attacks on undersea cables with the help of its intelligence ship, Yantar, which was spotted loitering near cable locations in 2019 and 2021. NATO Assistant Secretary General for Intelligence and Security David Cattler expressed particular concern about Russian activity in European waters, following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Cattler told reporters in May 2023 that Russia could attack infrastructure such as undersea cables in an attempt to “disrupt Western life and gain leverage over those nations that are providing support to Ukraine.”

For a sense of how interruptive cable cutting could be, look to the African continent and the Matsu Islands. In April 2018, damage to the Africa Coast to Europe cable—which at the time connected twenty-two countries along the western coast of Africa and Europe—caused significant connectivity issues (and in some cases days-long blackouts) for ten countries. Reporters suggested that the damage could have been caused by Sierra Leone, as the country’s government seemed to have imposed other internet blackouts on its citizens around the same time, impacting communications for not just social but also economic and governance matters.

In February 2023, two Chinese vessels on two separate instances severed cables in the East China Sea—one on February 2 and another on February 8. Although there is no direct evidence that the vessels did so intentionally, Taiwanese local officials said that the cable cuts are part of repeated cable breaks that amount to harassment by China. For nearly two months, the over thirteen thousand residents of the Taipei-governed Matsu Islands endured an internet outage, encountering great difficulty when conducting business and communicating. For China, understanding how undersea cable cuts can impact Taiwan provides useful insights that can be leveraged in both traditional and hybrid warfare.

These interruptions hit particularly hard when countries don’t have many connection points. For example, while Saudi Arabia has sixteen cable connections, the Matsu Islands only have two connections. Norway’s Svalbard archipelago similarly only has two connections, while Tonga only has one. The impact of a severe cable cut also depends on a country’s ability to fix damaged or degraded cables. It took Taiwan over a month to repair cables stretching to the Matsu Islands. For Tonga, whose cable was damaged by a volcanic eruption in 2022, it took ten days for a cable repair ship stationed in Papua New Guinea to even reach the island before beginning repairs, which then took several weeks.

Clusters of countries have begun to acknowledge the increasing threats to undersea cables. For example, in 2019, Japan outlined the Data Free Flow with Trust (DFFT) concept that promotes the free flow of data and the protection of individual privacy, national security, and intellectual property by connecting undersea cables only with allies and partner nations. At a May 2023 summit in Hiroshima, the Group of Seven (G7) endorsed the creation of the Institutional Arrangement for Partnership, which puts DFFT into action. The G7 also issued a communiqué (albeit more of a political consensus than any sort of treaty) with a section committing to collaborate more on undersea cable security.

Should the G7 countries follow through on their commitment—for example, by investing in an undersea cable project together—they could affect geopolitics in the undersea cable world and highlight to political and business leaders how necessary it is to keep countries connected through cables.

The G7’s progress and NATO’s recent establishment of a London-based center on protecting undersea cables are examples of how the United States prefers to share cables with likeminded countries. These efforts also demonstrate how democratic states are joining together in smaller consortia to invest in establishing and securing undersea communication cables.

Democratic states are also investing in undersea cables as a way to spread the free flow of data. In June 2023, the East Micronesia Cable project to connect several islands in Oceania began, funded by Australia, Japan, and the United States—with the understanding that connectivity is vital to economic development and, in this case, a means to counter Chinese influence in the region. The project was slow to start, as it faced a stalemate after China’s HMN Technologies submitted a tempting bid to build the cable, and the United States warned the Pacific islands about the risks associated with the participation of a Chinese company. Soon after, all bids were deemed noncompliant and removed from consideration, a challenge to China’s increasing control of digital traffic in Oceania.

China’s influence in the undersea cable world has grown immensely in recent years. In 2019, China owned, supplied, or was a landing point for over 11 percent of the world’s undersea cables, and it is aiming to grow this proportion to 20 percent by 2030. US warnings about Chinese cable companies demonstrate how Washington, with its allies and partners, is working to counter Chinese influence in supplying undersea cables in the Pacific.

#### A global deterrence plan

The world’s information is in serious danger, as perpetrators could resort to malicious attacks not only to interrupt connectivity but also to tap into the cables and eavesdrop. When undersea cables are cut or damaged, the laws that determine who is responsible for sabotage vary depending on where the cables are laid. For example, a coastal state has sovereign rights in its territorial sea, according to Article 21 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). In addition, a coastal state may exercise its rights to repair and maintain undersea cables in its exclusive economic zone, according to UNCLOS Article 58.

However, in regard to cables that are sabotaged in international waters, there is currently no effective regime to hold the perpetrator of damage responsible. If cables are willfully or accidentally damaged by a ship or person, the jurisdiction to determine an appropriate punishment for the perpetrator lies with the state under whose flag the ship operates or that of the person’s citizenship. Because this places onus on the perpetrator’s state, not the state that owns the cable, there is no effective regime to ensure that the responsible party is held accountable directly.

It is time for an intergovernmental organization such as the UN or its International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to take undersea cable security seriously and establish internationally recognized protocols under a formalized protection plan that deters actions against undersea cables and prioritizes the security of digital communications.","The article titled ""International law doesn’t adequately protect undersea cables. That must change"" by Katherine Walla discusses the vulnerabilities and legal inadequacies surrounding undersea cables, particularly in the context of international law and potential sabotage.

It directly mentions ""undersea cables"" and ""cut cables,"" elaborating on the implications of such actions that can lead to severe interruptions in international communications and data leaks.

Egypt lost more than half its Internet capacity because of Wednesday’s breaks and intends to seek compensation, its ministry of communications said in a news release.

India’s booming outsourcing industry, which provides a range of back-office services, like insurance claims processing and customer support to overseas clients over the Internet, played down Wednesday’s disruption, saying they had used back-up plans.

FLAG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of India’s number two mobile operator Reliance Communications, said on its Web site on Friday its FALCON cable had been reported cut at 0559 GMT, 56 kms (35 miles) from Dubai, between the United Arab Emirates and Oman.

Egyptian telecom authorities said about 55 percent of the country’s Internet capacity had been restored by Friday, thanks to rerouting of traffic.

Egypt is to ask FLAG and SEA-ME-WE to compensate its Internet and call centre companies. The communications minister, Tarek Kamel, has also decided to make Egypt’s Internet Service Providers and Telecom Egypt compensate all their Internet subscribers by providing them with a month’s subscription free of charge.

The International Cable Protection Committee, an association of 86 submarine cable operators dedicated to safeguarding undersea cables, has declined to speculate on the cause of the breaches, saying investigations were underway.

It said more than 95 percent of transoceanic telecoms and data traffic are carried by undersea, the rest by satellite.

“The repair ship has been notified and expected to arrive at the (Dubai) site in (the) next few days,” FLAG said.

The Internet Service Providers’ Association of India said cable repair ships had already been sent to fix the breaches off northern Egypt, which are in segments of two intercontinental cables known as SEA-ME-WE-4 and FLAG Europe-Asia.

FLAG said these repairs should start by Feb. 5 and be complete after one week.

Rajesh Chharia, president of the Internet Service Providers’ Association, said all of FLAG’s traffic had now been shifted to the SEA-ME-WE-3 cable network.

FLAG’s rival, Indian Internet service provider Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL), said the majority of its Internet services to the Middle East and North Africa had been restored within 24 hours, as had services to India.

VSNL said in a statement it had used the SEA-ME-WE-3, SEA-WE-ME-4 eastbound and TIC cable to reroute customer traffic.

U.S. phone companies Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc both use the cables which were affected on Wednesday. AT&T said on Thursday its networks were already back to normal as it had rerouted traffic and Verizon expected service to be restored for all its customers within days.

One of the biggest disruptions of modern telecoms systems was in December 2006, when a magnitude 7.1 earthquake broke nine submarine cables between Taiwan and the Philippines, cutting connections between southeast Asia and the rest of the world. Internet links were thrown out in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan and the Philippines, disrupting the activities of banks, airlines and all kinds of email users. Traffic was rerouted through other cables, but it took 49 days to restore full capacity.

"Undersea Cables: Critical Infrastructure Facing Growing Vulnerabilities","Examines recent attacks on undersea cables, including a Red Sea incident causing major communication disruptions, underscoring their critical role in global connectivity.","https://www.orfonline.org/research/undersea-cables-are-increasingly-critical-and-vulnerable","","Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan",Yes,"Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan","New Delhi, India",-,"2024-03-27","English","Observer Research Foundation (ORF)","Recent events in the Red Sea have brought to the fore another security vulnerability, that of the security of undersea telecommunications cables.

UAE officials in early March said that three cables running through the Red Sea had been possibly attacked by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, although the Houthis themselves denied it. The cables provide connectivity for both internet and telecommunications across different regions. The media report noted that the alleged attack tampered with many communication cable lines, including Asia-Africa-Europe 1, the Europe India Gateway, Seacom and TGN (Tata Global Network)-Gulf, and Hong Kong-based HGC Global Communications.

Reportedly, the cuts impacted 25 percent of the communications passing through Red Sea from Asia to Europe. Many companies have had to take immediate remedial steps, including re-routing, in order to limit the effect of the cable cuts. Tata Communications for instance said that they are “keeping a close watch on the situation and had initiated immediate and appropriate remedial actions.” Tata Communications added that they “invest in various cable consortiums to increase our diversity and hence in such situations of a cable cut or snag we are able to automatically reroute our services, thereby ensuring our customers have a stable, reliable and scalable connectivity.”

The Red Sea has long been considered a maritime shipping choke point but it is also “an internet and telecommunications bottleneck,” according to experts at the Center for International and Strategic Studies (CSIS). With around 90 percent of communications between Europe and Asia, as well as 17 percent of global internet traffic, passing through cables under the narrow Bab al-Mandab Strait, it is a major chokepoint for the communication sector.

According to a recent Congressional Research Service (CRS) report, “commercial undersea telecommunication cables carry about 99% of transoceanic digital communications (e.g., voice, data, internet), including financial transactions.”

Undersea cables are critical infrastructure with important implications for the global economy and communication system connecting different regions. According to a recent Congressional Research Service (CRS) report, “commercial undersea telecommunication cables carry about 99% of transoceanic digital communications (e.g., voice, data, internet), including financial transactions.” The report added that there are more than 500 commercial undersea cables owned and operated by individual private companies as well as consortia of companies; these cables have become the mainstay of the global internet.

The importance of these cables, covering over 1.4 million kilometers connecting literally every country in the world, cannot be ignored. With more big companies entering the fray, this number will likely go up in the coming years. Already, big global firms such as Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft dominate the scene, owning or leasing around half of all undersea bandwidth. But such heavy dependence can mean a significant vulnerability and in turn calls for greater protection.

There have been intentional and unintentional attacks on undersea cable infrastructure. The Nord Stream pipeline attack in September 2022 highlighted the vulnerability faced by such cables and led to calls for ensuring better protective measures for undersea telecommunication cables. In terms of intentional attacks on telecommunication cables, two incidents in April and October 2022 are noteworthy, when multiple cables were cut in southern France. This appeared to have been a coordinated and targeted attack. A cloud security company, Zscaler, in a blog post said that the attack “impacted major cables with connectivity to Asia, Europe, the U.S. and potentially other parts of the world.”

There have been also many natural events that have cut or damaged cables, resulting in interference and disruptions in communication. Undersea cable damage in Tonga, a South Pacific archipelago nation, after a volcanic eruption in January 2022 is a case in point. Cloudfare said in a blog post that internet connections had been restored after 38 days, following the successful completion of repairs to the undersea cable. Equally critical to note is that cable repair is extremely challenging and expensive. In the Tonga case, it was estimated that the daily costs for the ship responsible for repairing the cable, the CS Reliance, was between $35,000 and $50,000.

The Nord Stream pipeline attack in September 2022 highlighted the vulnerability faced by such cables and led to calls for ensuring better protective measures for undersea telecommunication cables.

It is, however, an increasing challenge to identify if damage to undersea cables is intentional or the result of natural events or accidents. Analysts have noted that damage can be caused by fishing nets, weather, ship anchors, sharks, or even sinking cargo ships, as was seen in the recent Red Sea incident. Inability to make a distinction between intentional attacks and accidents can be problematic for a couple of different reasons. First, potential saboteurs can benefit from the difficulty in determining specific causes of damage. And second, this ambiguity generates challenges in terms of governance and regulatory measures aiming to better undersea cable security.

There are no easy answers to dealing with undersea cable security. First and foremost, along with cybersecurity and protection of other vital infrastructure, undersea cables need to be treated as critical infrastructure. The need to acknowledge the vulnerability this poses to global communication systems is the first step. A second step may be for firms to invest in diverse cable consortiums so that it is possible to re-route and thereby create redundancy in order to mitigate the effects of undersea cable disruptions.

Also, the protection of undersea cables can be pursued through minilateral groupings such as the Quad. The Quad in May 2023 announced a new initiative for undersea cable protection in the Indo-Pacific, called the “Quad Partnership for Cable Connectivity and Resilience” as part of its broader efforts to develop better and more resilient infrastructure. Considering that the potential damage to undersea cables can affect all countries, a larger global multilateral effort should also be undertaken, despite the fact that multilateral efforts are increasingly threatened by rising great power competition.

At the bottom of the freezing Sea of Okhotsk, deep inside Russian waters, a US submarine creeps into position. Navy divers emerge from a hatch they call “the Bat Cave” and sneak along the dark ocean floor, searching for a cable just centimetres wide on which they’ve planted a listening device – and, all the while, the Soviet fleet above is none the wiser.

It’s the 1970s and this is one of the most daring missions of the Cold War: wiretapping the secret communications cable between the Soviet fleet’s Pacific base and headquarters in Russia. The Soviets thought it so well guarded, in a heavily patrolled peninsula rigged with sound detectors, that most of what passed down that cable wasn’t even in code.

For a decade, US divers would return every month to retrieve the latest transmissions captured from their bug so analysts at the US spy agency the NSA could binge-listen to the juicy disclosures – from Soviet nuclear secrets to commanders’ conversations with their mistresses. Then, after yielding some of the most useful intelligence of the Cold War, Operation Ivy Bells came to a halt suddenly in the 1980s when a bankrupt NSA analyst quit his job and walked into the Soviet embassy to sell US secrets.

A high-stakes Cold War wiretap under the sea might sound leagues away from our “wireless” world today. But the internet is not held in the “cloud” or beamed down by satellites – at least, not for the most part. More than 95 per cent of our data runs through a little-known network of undersea cables, each not much wider than a garden hose, stretching thousands of kilometres long.

While these cables are faster than satellites, some experts warn they are not well protected – and sabotage still happens. As Russia wages war in Ukraine and China expands into the private cable market, many countries are ramping up their underwater surveillance, including Australia.

Right now, these words are likely travelling along the bottom of the ocean at close to the speed of light. Fibre-optic cables that transmit data as light are the superhighways on which the internet (and phone lines) travel between continents – they have much higher bandwidth than satellites and are specially reinforced to lie at the bottom of the sea, even resisting shark bites. Sci-fi writer Neal Stephenson once called them “Mother Earth’s motherboard”, and they were even entangled in the NSA surveillance scandal revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden in 2013. A secret deal with US telco giant AT&T created the now infamous “Room 641A” at AT&T’s San Francisco site – behind its door, the NSA could tap cables coming up from the Pacific Ocean without a warrant.

More than 450 undersea internet cables crisscross the Earth, covering more than 1 million kilometres in total. “Submarine cables have been the backbone of communications all the way back to the telegraph,” says former Australian intelligence official Dr William Stoltz at the ANU’s National Security College.

The first transatlantic cable was laid in 1858, connecting the US with Britain. Queen Victoria marked the occasion by sending a wire to US President James Buchanan – it took 17 hours to arrive. Things might be faster (and digitised) now, but the architecture is largely the same, Stoltz says.

More than 450 undersea internet cables crisscross the Earth, covering more than 1 million kilometres in total, and dozens more are planned. They can zap the equivalent of the United States’ entire collection in the Library of Congress across the other side of the world in moments. Australia is connected by at least a dozen cables itself, many of which land in Sydney and Perth.

Most of the world’s cables today still go through the US, although some nations, including those in South America and Europe, have been teaming up on routes bypassing the US, in light of the NSA spying scandal. There’s an even stronger move to bypass China and its tech giant, Huawei, long suspected of allowing backdoors for Chinese spies in its systems.

The only continent not plugged into the world’s undersea web is Antarctica, which relies entirely on satellites instead. Former Australian Antarctic station leader David Knoff likens operating without the subsea connections to “about 20 years ago, where you couldn’t watch movies, a short video clip would take an hour to download –occasionally it works but it’s a roll of the dice.” Some, including the Bureau of Meteorology, want Antarctica to get its own cable, as plans push ahead to lay lines beneath the freezing Arctic at the other end of the world.

But rolling out undersea cables is expensive and difficult. Almost all are privately owned and managed – often by consortiums of large telcos such as AT&T as well as, increasingly, the tech giants Google, Facebook (now Meta), Amazon and Microsoft. “Governments almost entirely rely on a handful of firms,” says Stoltz. “We don’t have our own sovereign capability to build, repair and inspect these things.”

Huawei Marine, now trading as HMN Technologies, has laid or repaired about 100, or almost a quarter, of the world’s cables. Google says it has invested in 22, including the newly launched 15,000 kilometre “Equiano” from Portugal to South Africa. Telstra owns a stake in 27 cables, more than 400,000 kilometres worth. “That’s the equivalent of going around the world 10 times,” says the chief of Telstra International, Oliver Camplin-Warner. “We’re the biggest provider inside Asia.”

He compares the undersea network to airline routes, following demand, “like London to Singapore”. Most people don’t realise the “magic” of how the internet works, he says. “They [often] think it just disappears up into the sky to a satellite.”

But you can wrap your hand around these cables – they are bundles of steel and copper and plastic, coated in petroleum jelly to help protect the delicate hair-thin optic fibres within. “They’re strong”, says Camplin-Warner, built today with “better armour” to withstand more extreme pressure as well as more sensors to detect disruptions.

Still, they are vulnerable – especially to natural disasters or stray boat anchors. Tonga is connected by just one subsea cable and at the start of this year, it was cut off from the world for more than a month when a volcanic eruption knocked out that line.

That’s why charting a new undersea cable route can take a year of planning. About 46,000 kilometres of new cable on average are installed globally each year – unspooled from specially fitted-out ships. “Picture almost a farmyard plough behind a tractor,” says Camplin-Warner. Near shore, “we bury the cable down into the seabed” for extra protection. Sensors on large ships set off alarms if they get too close. And Telstra uses an “Always On” system to near-instantly reroute internet traffic from one cable to another if there’s a problem. “The minute anything happens [our centres] know,” says Camplin-Warner. “We can tell how far the light [data] is travelling down the cable before it disappears so we can quickly work out exactly where the break is.”

Of course, the world’s small fleet of cable repair ships – those designed to haul up the damaged section of cable and splice in a new one – are also privately owned. “And there’s not enough,” says Anthony Bergin, a senior defence analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI). “It was [weeks before a repair ship came out](https://sea-technology.com/cable-repair-tonga) to Tonga and fixed their cable.”

With more of the world moving online – not to mention new underwater energy cables to export solar power and more – Bergin argues it’s time we took the security of all undersea cables more seriously. After all, you can find most on public maps. And, while there are still a few government cables off the books, Ivy Bells style, for more sensitive information, Stoltz says the vast bulk of agency intelligence worldwide travels along the same cables that carry our everyday communications.","The article titled ""A dozen undersea cables connect Australia to the internet.

Undersea cables are vulnerable to many forces — both natural and man-made, so those cables need to be designed and built with additional protection in order to make them resistant and reliable.

Even though hidden deep in the sea and invisible to us, submarine cables are of crucial importance for our daily lives. Undersea cables carry 99 percent of all intercontinental communication, which means that business and private communications, as well as financial transactions, are absolutely depending on their efficiency.

Submarine power cables are deployed as well in the offshore industry by oil and gas rigs and marine renewable energy installations to provide power, shore-to-platform and internal platform fiber-optic communications, and oceanographic monitoring and surveillance.

Unfortunately, undersea cables are vulnerable and do break or get damaged by ships’ anchors, trawling, or due to some other environmental issues. For that reason, submarine cables need to be designed and built with additional protection, making them resistant and reliable enough.

### Possible Applications of Submarine Cables

Submarine power cables are dedicated to the transportation of the electric power below the surface of the water. Most of the time, they are coupled with optic fibers in order to monitor the cables but also to ensure the communication of the data. Exposed to tough conditions as heat, cold, and saltwater, but as well to external events such as dragging anchors, dropping objects, and fishing, their protection is crucial to their performance.

In general, power and telecommunication submarine cables are deployed for the entire lifetime of the project, from the first step to decommissioning. They are of critical importance for the safe transfer of the power generated. The oil and gas industry is one of the first industries deploying undersea cables to connect oil and gas platforms to mainland power grids.

But despite being examples of advanced technology, submarine cables remain vulnerable and relatively easy to damage.

They can get disrupted for a number of reasons that include natural disasters, fishing trawler nets dragging cables along with the catch, or accidents related to subsea installations. Since the damages happen unexpectedly, the availability of repair vessels is often limited and the elimination of the problem may take some time and incur high expenses.

Governments and industrial key players are uniting their expertise and funds to look for reliable submarine cable protection solutions. Many efforts have been made in design and material selection but also laying and maintenance vessels. The sector is in continuous development and in search of reliable innovative solutions.

### Available Submarine Cable Protection Solutions

Depending on the industry, the seabed conditions, and the depth, there are various submarine protection systems available right now at the market. All of them share the same objective: protecting the submarine cables from fatigue, overbending, and external factors.

Bend restrictors, bend stiffeners, protecting and ballasting shells, or split pipes are used at the bottom of the foundations to protect the cable near the platform. Most of the time, the entire system is called a CPS (cable protection system). Bend restrictors are applied to ensure the bending radius of the cable will not exceed the minimum bending radius defined by the manufacturer. Bend stiffeners are especially designed and manufactured for use in dynamic applications to prevent failure as a result of cyclic loading.

The shells, cylindrical half shells, or split pipes usually include bend restrictor functions and other connection elements and, therefore, are used as part of a complete cable protection system most of the time. They are especially adapted for the crossing of the scour protection at the bottom of the platforms as well as for rocky or challenging seabeds thanks to their abrasion resistance and stabilizing/ballasting abilities. This protection adds some stiffness to the point of connection to a rigid structure.

Concrete mattress, rock dumping, and rock bags are used to protect longer cable sections. However, the main solution to protect the longer section of cables (inter-array and export cables) is to bury the cable on the seabed. The rock dumping or the concrete mattress are used when burial is not possible or, in some cases, used as an added measure. The installation of the concrete mattresses is challenging due to the concerns related to the alignment and the “butting up” tolerances. This system requires specific means including frames, ROVs, etc.

Finally, the shells deserve a special word, since this is the only solution that can be used in both applications — in CPS but also to protect longer cable section. Moreover, at the shore landing areas and due to sedimentary movement, the shells are the most suitable solution. They are positioned along the cable and can additionally ballast the installation.

Most of the time, the mentioned solutions are made of composite materials and, most specifically, polymers such as polyurethane. The main advantage of polyurethane is its resistance to corrosion. Cast iron is corrosion resistant as well, and it provides an additional advantage with a ballasting/stabilization function.

The use of cast iron for offshore ballasting shells ensures cable protection, stability, strength, and the best possible performance thanks to the mechanical properties of the material able to withstand the harshness of marine environments.

### Case Study: Protecting and Ballasting Cast-Iron Shells

FMGC is a European leader in the design and manufacture of cast-iron counterweights. Some years ago, the French company started applying its expertise in ballast solutions to the offshore sector. Its participation at the IBOCS projects marks an important milestone in the development of the industry in France. The aim of the project was to develop a full range of articulated cast iron shells that protect, ballast, and stabilize subsea conducts (cables, pipes, etc.).

Made of ductile cast iron, the main goal of the FMGC is to provide a cost-effective solution that can reduce the cost of the cable protection thanks to its specific design. The solution is combining the protection, the stabilization, and the bend restrictor aspect in only one product that can be directly installed on the deck of the laying vessel. Thanks to the specific design, the need for other dedicated means and additional ships is drastically reduced.

These shells can be used as part of a cable protection system in addition to polyurethane products and also for the protection and stabilization of longer sections of cable for the shore landing or for rocky or challenging seabed where burial is not possible.

The solution can be easily adapted to various types of cables: from telecom cable of 20 mm to export cable of 300 mm.

The material choice in this case is important because of the unique mechanical properties of ductile cast iron withstanding the harshness of marine environments, resisting high impact, abrasion, and corrosion.

The French company Enedis, which manages 90 percent of the public electricity distribution network of continental France, has used the FMGC protecting and ballasting shell on several of its most challenging projects. One of the latest applications has been the protection and stabilization of an underwater cable, crossing the Fier d’Ars between Loix and Les Portes en Ré.

The feedback of Kerlann Marine, one of the companies that has been assigned by ENEDIS to lay the cables and install the shells: “After using some models of shells with different designs, the model used for the construction site of Houat 1 — IBL100 is very well studied; the implementation is fast and simple; the weight is correct for the displacement; the shell widths are well studied for curves.”

### Floating Offshore Wind Applications

All recent technological advancements in the offshore wind industry result in the increase of the viability of large offshore turbines capable of taking advantage of the higher wind speeds in greater water depths. Traditional bottom-fixed foundations are not suitable to these environmental conditions. Therefore, new floating platforms such as Floatgen, Hywind Scotland, and, most recently, Kincardine are about to rise and make the sector move steadily forward.

All floating structures need submarine cables to run through the water, from their substructure base to the seabed. This is a dynamic cable system that should transmit stable electric power from the floating offshore platform to a substation on land.

Exposed to greater levels of mechanical stress produced by marine currents and the movement of waves, these cables are subject to an increased risk of failure. The dynamic cables are attacked by the sea currents, the action of the waves, and the movement of the floating turbine platform itself; therefore, their protection is of critical importance.","The article discusses submarine cables and their vulnerabilities extensively, mentioning that they can be damaged by various forces, including ships' anchors and environmental issues.

"Undersea Internet Cable Cuts in the Middle East: Implications for Iran","Details on two cables cut near Alexandria and one near Dubai, raising concerns about communication disruptions for Iran and strategic motives behind the incidents.","https://www.sott.net/article/148301-Undersea-internet-cable-cut-in-Middle-East-Should-Iran-be-worried","","",Yes,-,"Otto, North Carolina, United States",-,"2024-07-05","English","Quantum Future Group, Inc.","**Title: Undersea internet cable cut in Middle East - Should Iran be worried?**

There has been some concern that the undersea internet cables, that have been cut recently, are perhaps no accident?

The first incident happened 8km from Alexandria in Egypt, which involved 2 cables apparently alongside each other. According to initial reports, the cables may have been ""snapped"" by a ship´s anchor.

Whilst this explanation is certainly a possibility, it seems a strange coincidence that barely two days later another cable is cut, this time 56km from Dubai in the Persian Gulf. There is even rumor of a fourth cable being damaged, but this has not been confirmed.

**The countries most affected by the damaged cables are Egypt, India and the Middle East (in particular Iran). Israel and Iraq, as far as we can tell, were not affected by this problem as they use an alternative route for this service.**

Cables involved in the ""breaks"" belong to companies connected to Reliance Communication Ventures, where Anil Ambani has a 66.75% interest. His father (Dhirubhai Ambani) originally founded the company and it is a classical rags to riches story.

Dhirubhai Ambani started with absolutely nothing, but developed a company that was a huge success. Questions were raised about how Dhirubhai managed to raise so much cash to do this, and this appears to be the result of a ""Non-Resident Indian"" investing Rs. 220 million in Reliance during 1982-1983. Dhirubhai has been accused of ""manipulating"" government policies and was known to be a ""king-maker"" in government elections (enjoying a certain amount of media protection). He was also involved in other business interests, including the oil industry.

Following Dhirubhai´s death in 2002, the company was split between the Ambani brothers, with the youngest (Anil Ambani) taking control of Reliance. Anil, born June 4 1959, is the 6th richest person in the world (worth $45 billion).

On the assumption that the cables cut were no accident, we must ask ourselves who would do such a thing and why. Clearly Iran, who were most affected, would gain nothing from such an action and are perhaps the target of those responsible?

**But why would anyone want to disrupt communications in Iran (and other countries)? Could this be some subtle message to Iran, an example of how their communications can be affected by outside forces? Maybe this is a prelude to an attack, or perhaps a test run for a future one?**

Communication has always been an important factor in military action, and cutting these cables might affect Iran´s ability to defend itself. But even if that were not the case, it would certainly make it difficult for them to report any events to the outside world. **So, if they were attacked, we would have to rely on news reports from the usual sources (the Mainstream Media), and we all know where their loyalties lie.**

**Oddly enough, Russia also experienced some ""internet problems"" during this same period, but that may be another coincidence?**","The article titled ""Undersea internet cable cut in Middle East - Should Iran be worried?"" discusses the cutting of undersea internet cables in detail.

It mentions specific incidents, such as two cables cut near Alexandria, Egypt, and another near Dubai, suggesting a pattern that raises concerns about whether these cuts were accidental.

@MWEBGuy says the Internet service provider (ISP) is currently trying to source additional capacity. The social media face of the ISP was responding to queries from subscribers about slow or no Internet service posted on Twitter.

Internet Solutions has also experienced problems as a result of the outage, with its Twitter account indicating it has rerouted traffic and added bandwidth, but some people may experience latency. It does not give a timeframe for resolution.

### Work in progress

Simpson says the exact root cause is not likely to be known until the cable is repaired in the coming week or two, and the damaged section is recovered from the seabed and inspected. ""I know that many of you are keen to know the cause of the outage is a physical cable cut some kilometres north of the coast of Egypt in the Mediterranean Sea.""

Seacom suspects, based on its experience with sub-sea systems and the nature of the sea area where the cut has occurred, that ""the most likely cause is external aggression to the cable, most probably caused by a larger vessel dragging its anchor across the seabed"".

This is a common cause of damage to cable systems globally, despite continued efforts to protect the cable with armour, burying, notifications to ships of cable location and exclusion zones, notes Simpson.

Simpson says the Seacom team remains committed to getting restoration services up. ""However, this process is proving much more complex and taking longer than we were initially told by our suppliers and would have expected.""

Seacom continues to push for activation as a priority, coordinating across a number of carriers internationally, says Simpson. ""However, as this is not providing solutions in the timeframe we require, we are also actively seeking new restoration solutions. This will continue to take some time and we are not able to provide timeframes as yet on when services will be restored.","The article 'Seacom suffers cable break' discusses a specific incident involving a break in an undersea cable, detailing its impact on internet connectivity and the efforts to restore service.

It mentions the cause of the break, the affected regions, and the expected timeframe for repairs, all of which align with the criteria for being on the topic of cut sea cables.

The central theme of the article is focused on this incident, making it highly relevant."

No, it wasn’t just you, or because of the lockdown either. The internet across much of South Africa was slow this weekend thanks to yet another undersea cable break.

The WACS cable broke between the UK and Portugal this weekend, leaving much of the western portion of South Africa with longer load times and all-round slower internet during the initial days of the COVID-19 lockdown.

"Undersea Cable Damage Causes Internet Outages Across Africa","Disruption of internet services in Ivory Coast, Liberia, and Benin due to damage to four major cables; critical telecommunications impact highlighted.","https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/outages/undersea-cable-damage-causes-internet-outages-across-africa","","Bloomberg News",Yes,"Bloomberg News","San Francisco, California, USA","10000","2024-06-03","English","Bloomberg News","(Bloomberg) -- Damage to four subsea cables off the west coast of Africa is disrupting internet services across the continent.

The West Africa Cable System, MainOne, South Atlantic 3, and ACE sea cables – arteries for telecommunications data – were all affected on Thursday and early Friday, triggering outages and connectivity issues for a second day for mobile operators and internet service providers, according to data from internet-analysis firms including NetBlocks, Kentik, and Cloudflare. The cause of the cable faults has not yet been determined.

Data show a major disruption to connectivity in eight West African countries, with Ivory Coast, Liberia, and Benin being the most affected, NetBlocks, an internet watchdog, said in a post on X. Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon are among other countries impacted. Several companies have also reported service disruptions in South Africa.

“This is a devastating blow to internet connectivity along the west coast of Africa, which will be operating in a degraded state for weeks to come,” said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis firm Kentik.

Ghana’s National Communications Authority said the cable disruptions occurred in Senegal, Ivory Coast, and Portugal.

“This has led to a significant degradation of data services across the country, with mobile network operators working around the clock to restore full services,” the authority said.

The cable faults off Ivory Coast come less than a month after three telecommunications cables were severed in the Red Sea, highlighting the vulnerability of critical communications infrastructure. The anchor of a cargo ship sunk by Houthi militants was probably responsible, according to assessments by the US and cable industry group the Internet Cable Protection Committee.

The Red Sea is a critical telecommunications route, connecting Europe to Africa and Asia via Egypt. The damaged cables carried about 25% of traffic in the region, according to estimates from Hong Kong-based internet provider HGC Global Communications, which uses the cables. It was re-routed via alternative cables, including via the west coast of Africa.

Together, the problems with cables on either side of the continent create a capacity crunch, with customers of those cables scrambling to find alternative routes.

Africa’s biggest wireless carriers – MTN Group and Vodacom Group – said connectivity issues on undersea cable failures were affecting South Africa network providers. “Multiple undersea-cable failures between South Africa and Europe are currently impacting network providers,” Vodacom said in a text message.

MTN said services in several West African countries were affected and it was working to “reroute traffic through alternative network paths” and “engaging with our partners to speed up the repair process for the damaged cables.”

Microsoft Corporation reported disruptions to its cloud services and Microsoft 365 applications across Africa.

“We have determined that multiple fiber cables on the west coast of Africa have been impacted which reduced total capacity supporting our regions in South Africa,” Microsoft said in a status update, adding that the Red Sea cable cuts are also impacting the east coast. “The combination of incidents has impacted all Africa capacity – including other cloud providers and public internet as well.”

The Downdetector website showed that a number of companies in South Africa were still severely affected on Friday, including Microsoft and Nedbank Group.

Telkom SA SOC’s Openserve fiber unit and Standard Bank Group were also affected, they said in statement, with Openserve adding it had re-routed traffic.

Off the southeastern coast of South Africa, the island country of Mauritius also experienced outages, with Mauritius Telecom having to arrange to redirect traffic to other cables, it said.

Last year, the West African Cable System, along with another pipe – the South Atlantic 3 – were damaged near the mouth of the Congo River following an undersea landslide. The loss of the cables knocked out international traffic traveling along the west coast of Africa and took about a month to repair.","The article titled 'Undersea Cable Damage Causes Internet Outages Across Africa' discusses significant damage to four subsea cables off the west coast of Africa, specifically the West Africa Cable System, MainOne, South Atlantic 3, and ACE cables.

It details the disruption of internet services across several African countries including Ivory Coast, Liberia, and Benin, highlighting the severe impact on connectivity and communication.

The article states that the cause of the cable faults has not been determined but emphasizes the critical role these cables play in telecommunications.

Furthermore, it mentions previous incidents of cable damage and the ongoing issues faced by major telecommunications companies in restoring services.

This comprehensive coverage of undersea cable damage, its causes, and the consequences on internet connectivity aligns well with the criterion of discussing cut sea cables."

Military, intelligence, and political figures are warning about its fragility.

Some claim Russia is willing and able to sever internet access as an act of war.

This map shows how the huge, complicated network of undersea cables which keep the internet running is spread around the world.

The map, by telecom analytics company TeleGeography, uses coloured lines to show how there are many hundreds of fibre optic cables running under the world's oceans.

It shows the sheer scale of the infrastructure which keeps the internet running. It's built up over decades, mainly as a result of private enterprise rather than coordinated state infrastructure projects, like road or water networks.

Lines shown on the map above are not exactly geographically correct, but they show the broad path of the cables and which territories they connect.

According to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, 97% of all intercontinental data is carried via such cables.

Although they are of obvious strategic importance to the countries involved, relatively little is done to guard them. In recent months, defence authorities have started to warn that state aggressors — Russia in particular — could cut them.

A US admiral, one of Britain's most senior military commanders, the former head of GCHQ, and a London-based think-tank all made similar warnings in a matter of days late last year.

Rishi Sunak, a Conservative MP, produced a report for the Policy Exchange think-tank in which he warned that Russia is ""aggressively operating"" in the Atlantic, where cables link Europe and the US.

In the foreword to the report, retired US Navy Admiral James Stavridis claimed: ""Russian submarine forces have undertaken detailed monitoring and targeting activities in the vicinity of North Atlantic deep-sea cable infrastructure.""

He said they have the capacity to make a concentrated hit, causing ""potentially catastrophic"" damage.

Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, the UK's most senior military officer, gave a speech in December in which he said: ""There is a new risk to our way of life, which is the vulnerability of the cables that criss-cross the seabeds.

""Can you imagine a scenario where those cables are cut or disrupted, which would immediately and potentially catastrophically affect both our economy and other ways of living.""

At the start of December, former GCHQ director Robert Hannigan told The Times newspaper: ""In hybrid warfare you could tweak the UK economy, even without bringing it to its knees, by just cutting a few [fibre-optic cables].""

""It could slow things down and with automated trading you could make life pretty difficult if you wanted to without going for full conflict.""

Russia has responded to the threat by suggesting it is not serious. Its embassy in London ran a Twitter poll in response to the Times interview, where most respondents seemed not to take the prospect seriously.","The article discusses the strategic importance of undersea cables and explicitly mentions the potential for Russia to cut these cables, highlighting concerns from military and intelligence figures.

This piece also speaks directly to authorities within the Indian Navy and the Indian Coast Guard, as well as to other organisational structures concerned with India’s national security and the physical and electronic protection of India critical infrastructure. In seeking to mitigate the vulnerabilities attending submarine cables in India, Part-2 of this article will address legal aspects that ought to be of interest (and concern) to the Indian Navy’s Judge Advocate General’s Branch, the Legal & Treaties Division of the Ministry of External Affairs, the Ministry of Telecommunications, and, the Ministry of Law and Justice, as also to legal academic and research institutes in India and the larger Indian Ocean Region. The article strongly recommends that submarine communications cables landing in India be included within India’s “Critical Information Infrastructure System” (CIIS), and, that India exercise prescriptive jurisdiction over such submarine cables even under the High Seas, under the principle of “protective jurisdiction”.

While rapid technological advancements have transformed the submarine communications cable from a copper-based telegraph cable in 1850 to advanced fibre-optic cables today connecting continents across the globe, the development of the legal and regulatory mechanism to protect such cables from damage and interception leaves much to be desired.

The term “submarine cable” has been widely used, including in international treaties such as the United Nations Convention on the Laws of the Sea, but very little attempt appears to have been made to define it or to address the systems and networks associated with the term, at the international level. Even at the domestic level, at least amongst countries of the Indo-Pacific, there appears to be a very worrisome dearth in the degree of legal comprehensiveness with which this subject has been dealt. An exception is Australia, which is one of only a few nations with a dedicated regime for the protection of submarine cables. Schedule 3A of Australia’s “Telecommunications Act 1997” (as amended and in force on 2 March 2019) specifies in considerable detail, the legal regime for the protection of international submarine cables landing in Australia. As such, it offers an excellent example of a “best practice” that India’s own legal and maritime-strategic communities would do exceedingly well to study.

Australia’s domestic “Telecommunications Act” under reference defines a submarine cable as a specific type of “line link”. Within this expression, a ‘line’ itself is defined as a wire, cable, optical fibre, tube, conduit, waveguide or other physical medium used, or for use, as a continuous artificial guide for or in connection with carrying communications by means of guided electromagnetic energy. A “line link”, therefore, links two distinct places. Continuing on, an international submarine cable is defined (albeit for the purposes of that legislation) as that part of a line link that is laid on or beneath the seabed that lies beneath Australian waters or for purposes that include connecting a place in Australia with a place outside Australia (whether or not the cable is laid via another place in Australia) … and includes any device attached to that part of the line link… used in or in connection with the line link.

Indian legislation, on the other hand, does not define a submarine cable. The term ‘international submarine cable’ has been used and defined in the “International Telecommunication Access to Essential Facilities at Cable Landing Stations Regulations 2007”, but has been defined using the term ‘submarine cable’ without elaborating on what it constitutes. Further this term has been used in the context of facilitating access of submarine cables to cable landing stations in India rather than ensuring their protection.

The closest that Indian legislation comes to addressing communication cables is “The Indian Telegraph Act 1885” (1885 Act). The broad definition of ‘telegraph’ as “any appliance, instrument, material or apparatus used or capable of use for transmission or reception of signs, signals, writing, images and sounds or intelligence of any nature by wire, visual or other electro-magnetic emissions, Radio waves or Hertzian waves, galvanic, electric or magnetic means” (emphasis added), read with the definition of a ‘telegraph line’ as a “wire or wires used for the purpose of a telegraph”, does seem to suggest that the 1885 Act may extend its application to the version of the communication cable evolved from the telegraph, the optical fibre cable which uses modified pulses of infrared light (an electro-magnetic emission) to carry data. This interpretation is supported by the completion of a domestic underwater optical fibre cable system from Chennai to Andaman & Nicobar Islands under the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) project set up under s9A-9D of the 1885 Act.

However, the 1885 Act does not explicitly identify optical fibre submarine cables. This is hardly surprising, as the 1885 Act was conceptualised at a time long before the development of such a network, and its need within our society. Further there is no clarity whether it also includes ‘international’ submarine cables connecting India to places outside India. There has been an indication that the Department of Telecom’s optical fibre cable projects connecting India’s neighbouring countries would not fall under the USOF project. The focus of the USOF project, which uses funds appropriated from the Consolidated Fund of India, is to provide connectivity to the hinterlands and unconnected areas within India. Therefore, the present regime in India is far from being a dedicated regime for the protection of submarine cables connecting India to the rest of the world. The necessity for such a dedicated regime is highlighted below.

Of course, submarine cables are not limited to communications cables alone. Indeed. the term includes submarine communications cables as well as submarine power cables used to transmit power from one place to another. This article, however, concentrates upon submarine communication cables, which, taken in aggregate, form part of a network designed to transmit data from one place to another. The cable network begins with an armoured submarine cable connected to a cable station, which contains the servers from/to which data is to be transmitted. Cables that are laid in depths shallower than 1,500 metres (m) are often buried some 60 cm under the seabed in order to prevent them from damage by ships working their anchors, or other activity such as mining and dredging. However, those laid in depths in excess of 1,500 m are not buried but simply laid upon the seabed, because the chance of accidental damage at such depths is unlikely.

In India, the opportunity to provide international telecommunication links was made available to the private sector in 2002 and private players could operate in this industry after being issued an appropriate license. These private players are known as International Long Distance (ILD) providers. Cable systems in India are currently owned almost uniformly by private operators, who also undertake operations associated with these systems. While there are currently 16 operational submarine cable systems in India, at least 4 additional cable systems are planned.

Two ownership models are prevalent in India, namely, private ownership and consortium-based ownership. A ‘private ownership model’, as the name suggests, refers to a system wherein the cable is constructed and managed by a single entity who sells the international capacity to other telecom operators. The ‘consortium model’, on the other hand, is one wherein a group of international operators form a club to fund, build, operate and own the cable system. The members of the consortium build the cable landing stations in their respective countries and lay cables in accordance with the agreement executed between them. The capacity on the cable is then allocated according to the financial contribution and responsibilities of the telecom operator.

**Vulnerabilities and Threats**

Our interconnected, tech-enabled, globalised world, which allows for a message to be sent from India to the United States in ‘real time’, owes its existence to these physical cables travelling across continents. 97% of global communications are transmitted over 213 independent cable systems traversing 545,018 miles of fibre.","The article discusses submarine communication cables, their vulnerabilities, and their importance in global communications.

While it does not specifically mention 'cut sea cables,' it highlights the potential threats to these cables and their critical role in internet connectivity.

"Sharks and Vietnam’s Internet Cables: A Curious Connection","Explores the hypothesis of sharks causing multiple ruptures in the Asia-America Gateway cable, impacting internet connectivity in Southeast Asia.","https://www.dailydot.com/debug/sharks-vietnam-internet-cable","","Aja Romano",Yes,"Aja Romano","Austin, Texas, United States","30000","2015-01-06","English","Daily Dot","If you live in Southeast Asia and can’t stream YouTube videos or access Facebook, sharks may be to blame.

The underwater trans-Pacific cable that provides Internet to most of Southeast Asia broke again yesterday, leaving millions with slow or spotty connectivity. The region faces an estimated repair time of up to a month.

The Asia-America Gateway (AAG), launched in 2009, is an enormous underwater cable line stretching 12,000 miles across the Pacific. It connects 10 points throughout the Pacific islands and Southeast Asia and provides vital connectivity to several countries between Malaysia and California.

But one branch of the $500 million AAG has been continually beset with problems. The segment of the cable that runs between Vietnam and Hong Kong has ruptured four times within the last six months—twice near Hong Kong and twice near Vietnam. The latest incident occurred yesterday, when the cable broke near the Vietnamese city of Ba Ria.

In addition to Vietnam, the outage affects the cable’s offshoot points further west, which means Internet users in Brunei, Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia are also feeling the slow-down. Although these other countries rely on the cable, it is managed by one Vietnamese telecommunications company.

Investigators have not confirmed a reason for the latest rupture. One common explanation in these cases is that anchors from passing fishing trawlers snagged the cable and caused damage. Increasingly, however, cable watchers believe that the problem may be sharks.

Shark species in the region, these experts say, may be drawn to chow down on the cables, which send off electromagnetic waves that can act as sharkbait. One theory holds that sharks mistake the cables for the bioelectric fields surrounding schools of fish. Others suggest that perhaps sharks are merely overly curious.

Whatever the explanation, there are undoubtedly issues with sharks attacking undersea Internet cables. A surveillance camera attached to equipment reinforcing one of Google’s cables captured video of one such attack in August.

To prevent sharks from chomping through fragile and expensive fiber-optic wires, Google, which has pledged to collaborate on a similar $300 million undersea cable to Japan, has started wrapping its cables in kevlar.

It’s a smart plan, but it offers little in the way of comfort to frustrated Southeast Asians battling slow load times and month-long service outages.

In July 2019, 14 Russian sailors onboard a submarine were killed in an accident. The top-secret submarine, believed to be the *Losharik*, was attempting to dock with a larger submarine when an explosion occurred in her battery compartment. Rather than evacuating, the **14 sailors** closed a hatch and fought the resulting fire.

The *Loshiarik* can operate at depths other submarines cannot reach, and Western intelligence agencies have speculated that her mission was to tap information flowing through undersea cables. These cables form the backbone of worldwide communications.

The cables carry **95 percent** of daily worldwide communications, plus they carry financial transactions worth over **$10 trillion** a day. Any disruption would cause a catastrophic cut in the flow of capital.

Where these undersea cables come ashore are called ""landing areas,"" and the **U.S. Department of Homeland Security** lists these landing areas at the top of their list of ""critical infrastructure.""

### Undersea Telegraph Cables  
The first undersea transcontinental telegraph cable was completed in the summer of 1858. It ran under the Atlantic ocean from Newfoundland to Ireland, and it carried the first official telegraph message sent by **Queen Victoria** to U.S. President **James Buchanan**. That **509-letter** message took **17 hours and 40 minutes** to arrive.

Between the years 1858 and 1911, Britain's vast colonial empire required communication, and entrepreneurs in Britain financed the building, laying and maintenance of the first undersea telegraph cables.

Telegraph communication meant that ships could be directed to pick up cargo, governors of the various colonies could be in contact with London, and Britain could coordinate her military units.

During the 1860s and 1870s, Britain expanded her undersea cable telegraph network eastward into the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean. In 1870, a cable linking Bombay, India to London was completed by a consortium of **four cable companies**, and in 1872, these four companies combined to form the **Eastern Telegraph Company**.

A spin-off company, the **Eastern Extension China and Australasia Telegraph Company**, was formed, and in 1876, it linked Australia, Bombay, Singapore, and China.

In the Pacific Ocean, the U.S. linked to Hawaii in 1902, and that same year, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji were connected. Japan came on board in 1906.

### Undersea Telephone Cables  
It wasn't until 1955 that the first transatlantic telephone cable, **TAT-1** was laid between Oban, Scotland, and Clarenville, Newfoundland. It was inaugurated on September 25, 1956, and carried **36 telephone channels**.

### Undersea Fiber-Optic Cables  
The first **fiber-optic cables** were developed in the 1980s, and the first fiber-optic transatlantic telephone cable was **TAT-8**, which went into operation in 1988. Today's fiber-optic cables have their fibers arranged in a self-healing ring to increase redundancy, and their submarine sections follow different paths along the ocean floor. Some systems have dual landing points where they come onshore.

Today, **99 percent** of the data crossing the oceans is carried by undersea cables. As of 2012, data was flowing error-free at **100 Gbps** across Atlantic Ocean routes of up to **6,000 km**. That meant that a typical cable was capable of moving tens of terabits of data per second, with the fastest transatlantic connections taking less than **60 milliseconds (1/1,000 of a second)**.

### Undersea Cables and National Security  
Britain's very first action after declaring war in World War I was to have the cable ship *Alert* cut the **five undersea cables** that linked Germany to France, Spain, the Azores, and North America.

This forced the Germans to communicate by wireless, which meant that the cryptoanalysis section of the British Admiralty during WWI, known as **Room 40**, could listen in.

Today, the Pentagon is worried that ships like the *Losharik* appear to be accessing undersea cables at much greater depths, where the cables are harder to monitor and repair. They are particularly worried that the Russians can tap into these cables, something that the American agencies have been able to do for a long time. The U.S. has ""Network Security Agreements"" with the cable operators that allow it to conduct surveillance on a majority of the world’s voice and internet traffic.

The U.S. ensures the compliance of the cable operators by allowing the **Federal Communications Commission (FCC)** to hold up approvals for new cable licenses. The extent of the **National Security Agency’s (NSA)** access to fiber-optic cables is classified.

Because ships need to be made aware of cable locations, maps of submarine cables are widely available. This poses security issues for the various nations. Websites such as **TeleGeography** display maps and lists of the almost **350** cables spanning over **550,000** miles of ocean.

In recent years, there has been increased Russian naval activity along known cable corridors. A 2015 *New York Times* article described how American spy satellites, ships, and planes monitored the Russian spy ship *Yantar* as she followed a cable off the East Coast of the U.S.

The U.S. has also laid secret cables that are used for military operations, and that aren't marked on available maps. It's possible that Russian ships, such as the *Losharik,* are searching for these cables.

### Cable Repair  
Cables can be broken by ship's anchors, fishing trawlers, earthquakes, currents, and even shark bites. After 1980, cables were buried, but that didn't stop significant breaks from happening.

To repair cable, repair ships either bring the entire cable to the surface or else they cut the cable and bring up only the damaged portion. Then, a new section is spliced in.

### Antarctica  
Today, Antarctica remains the only continent not connected by a submarine telecommunications cable. Fiber-optic cable there would have to withstand temperatures of **-80 degrees C (-112 degrees F)** and the strain of flowing sea ice.","The article discusses the topic of undersea cables extensively, including their significance for global communications, historical incidents involving their disruption, and contemporary security threats posed by nations like the U.S. and Russia.

Shortly after the disruption, internet users across Pakistan faced a host of problems ranging from intermittent to slow internet connectivity. Many complained that their browsing speed had decreased significantly.  

“This is a result of a fault in the undersea cable line to Pakistan through Alexandria, Egypt. The fiber optic undersea cable SEA-ME-WE-4 was affected beyond Egypt for currently unknown reasons,” Wateen Telecom said in a statement.  

The fault disrupted about 50% of Pakistan’s internet traffic, according to Wahaj-us-Siraj, Convener of Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan (ISPAK). The network breakdown has affected over a dozen countries, he said.  

Explaining further, the ISPAK chief said Transworld Associates (TWA) and Pakistan Telecommunications Company Limited (PTCL) act as the internet gateway to Pakistan and provide bandwidth to local internet service providers. TWA and PTCL are connected with four undersea fiber optic cables that include I-ME-WE, SEA-ME-WE-3, SEA-ME-WE-4 and TWA-1.  

The country’s internet traffic is currently running on SEA-ME-WE-3and TWA-1 and catering to the entire telecommunications traffic, which has caused massive traffic congestion, Siraj said.  

The breakdown of SEA-ME-WE-4, however, has caused more problems than I-ME-WE.  

“It’s like you have four roads catering to the traffic; what will happen if two of these roads are closed,” Wahaj said.  

“The estimated time to repair has not been announced as of yet, as PTCL and TWA are in communication with SEA-ME-WE-4 consortium members to determine the time it will take to repair the cable,” Wateen Telecom added.  

SEA-ME-WE 4 provides a telecommunications link between Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Egypt, Italy, Tunisia, Algeria and France.  

The cable is approximately 18,800 kilometres long, and provides the primary internet backbone between South East Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East and Europe.  

_Published in The Express Tribune, March 28th, 2013._","The article titled 'Underwater cable damaged: Internet speed plummets by 60 nationwide' discusses the damage to the SEA-ME-WE 4 undersea fiber optic cable in the Arabian Sea, which directly falls under the topic of cut sea cables.

Mauritania itself was offline for nearly 48 hours before connectivity was partially restored. Other countries had enough terrestrial cable and satellite connections to route around the downed cable, but they still saw significant disruptions in internet access for most of the weekend.

Outages like this rarely make the headlines, but it’s a good reminder of exactly how fragile much of the internet’s infrastructure still is — particularly in places like West Africa. When a major cable gets cut, every other connection has to strain to pick up the slack. When there’s no other infrastructure to rely on, connectivity simply drops out. Lacking investment, the internet becomes less reliable for the entire region.

This is the problem that projects like Alphabet’s balloons and Facebook’s solar drones are trying to solve, at least in theory. But in practical terms, all that’s really needed is more cables and landing points — the kind of thing Nigeria has but Mauritania doesn’t. And after years of moonshot development, we still don’t have many options when a cable gets cut.","The article titled ""A broken submarine cable knocked Mauritania off the internet for two days"" directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables by detailing the incident involving the ACE Submarine cable that was cut, resulting in significant connectivity issues for Mauritania and other West African countries.

"The Undersea Cable-Severing Conspiracy","Discusses the cutting of three undersea cables affecting Middle East connectivity, disrupting VoIP and email services, with implications for global telecommunications.","https://www.wired.com/2008/02/the-undersea-ca","","Bruce Sterling",Yes,"Bruce Sterling","San Francisco, CA, US","100000","2008-02-06","English","WIRED","Captain Nemo did it. Better send Professor Aronnax out to investigate.

When three undersea cables providing connectivity in the Middle East and westward to Europe and North America were cut last week in the Middle East, the impact was immediate — and significant — as many with connections in the region were shut off from Internet communications. That meant VoIP service, IM, and email were suddenly unavailable.

Now, repair work has begun on one of the three severed cables, with a second repair vessel expected to begin servicing a second line imminently, with hopes that service to the Middle East and Asia would soon be restored.

Sunday, however, a fourth cable connecting Qatar and the UAR has also been cut, though apparently for a different reason. The first three, in the Mediterranean Sea and Persian Gulf, are said to have been severed by dragging anchors — though various reports claim that explanation has been retracted by the Egyptian Transport Ministry.

According to the Ministry’s official report, “The Ministry’s Maritime Transport Committee reviewed footage covering the period of 12 hours before and 12 hours after the cables were cut, and no ships sailed the area The area is also marked on maps as a no-go zone, and it is, therefore, ruled out that the damage to the cables was caused by shipping.”

The fourth cable has reportedly been shut down due to power issues, which are expected to take several days to repair.

With four cables now having been damaged in a week in the region, and particularly with the latest statement from the Ministry, speculation is running rampant as to whether the damage is a result of international sabotage.

Reports claim a variety of sources that might have incapacitated the cables, from the U.S. Secret Service, to Islamic fundamentalists, or other military exercises. Others maintain the damage signifies retribution for the impending opening of the Iranian Oil Bourse, which will allow trading in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, potentially diminishing the value of the dollar.

Clearly, the political impact, should the damage be attributed to military or financially motivated activity, poses severe implications, but apart from that, the mere impact on broadband connectivity within the region, and communications capabilities with Europe and North America have already been hampered, causing significant disruption to workflows at many businesses.

“This has been an eye-opener for the telecom industry worldwide,” said According to Colonel R.S. Parihar, Secretary of the Internet Service Providers Association of India. “Today, the cause of the problem might have been an anchor, but what if it is sabotage tomorrow? These are owned by private operators, and there are no governments or armies protecting these cables.”

Indeed, submarine cables carry nearly all global Internet and phone traffic — largely because it is considerably cheaper that satellite transmission — and further damage, or an inability to effectively repair the already disabled lines, could pose a significant impact on not only the global business community, which has come to rely heavily on IP-based communications.","The article titled ""The Undersea Cable-Severing Conspiracy"" discusses the cutting of multiple undersea cables and the implications of these incidents.

"Submarine Cable Repairs in South Africa","Internet speeds in South Africa dropped significantly due to breaks in the WACS and SAT-3 cables; repair efforts are underway to restore connectivity.","https://spectrum.ieee.org/undersea-cable-repairs-south-africa","","Jeff Hecht",Yes,"Jeff Hecht","Washington, D.C., United States",-,"2020-02-03","English","IEEE","A clock in South Africa is counting down the seconds until a pair of broken cables are expected to go back in service. Every few hours, the service provider TENET, which keeps South Africa's university and research facilities connected to the global Internet, tweets updates.

The eight-year-old West Africa Cable System (WACS) submarine cable, which runs parallel to Africa's west coast, broke at two points early on 16 January. That same day, an 18-year-old cable called SAT-3 that runs along the same route also broke.

Cable breaks, whether due to accidents or sabotage, are well-known risks, so most Internet service providers lease capacity on alternate routes as a backup, says Paul Brodsky, senior analyst at TeleGeography. Internet speeds in South Africa dropped after the break, but most services had backups and were able to maintain connections.

TENET restored its overseas connections by switching to an alternative 80-gigabit-per-second service on the SEACOM and EASSy cables on Africa's east coast. ""The latency ... increased due to this failover, but there are currently no reported issues of this being detrimental to connectivity,"" a representative of TENET said on 30 January.

If this break had occurred 15 years ago when the older broken cable was South Africa’s only direct, high-capacity international submarine cable connection, the country would have been almost completely cut off from the rest of the world.

The likely cause of the breaks was an undersea earthquake of magnitude 5.6 that took place off Ascension Island in the Atlantic, which occurred about two hours before the SAT-3 and WACS cables failed. The failures were in Congo Canyon which extends about 200 kilometers west from the mouth of the Congo River. Submarine earthquakes can trigger cable-snapping underwater landslides hundreds of kilometers away, and Congo Canyon has the strongest turbidity currents ever measured.

Six cables run north from South Africa—three on the west coast and three on the east coast—and most connect to coastal African countries along the way. That's a big improvement from the minimal service of the early 2000s. South Africa receives the largest share of the traffic, and Brodsky says one of the four fiber pairs in WACS runs express between South Africa and Europe. Countries north of the mouth of the Congo River did not lose their connections.

Most South African carriers had route diversity, with capacity available on two or more cables. One, Afrihost, had the bad luck of picking the SAT-3 cable as its main backup to the WACS cable. ""It was unprecedented that two completely geographically separate cables run by completely separate companies would fail within hours of each other,"" Afrihost CEO Gian Visser told Business Times. The company’s emergency capacity on a third cable initially was insufficient because other ISPs had to reroute their own traffic after the breaks.

The creation of regional Internet exchanges appears to have helped matters. ""Localization of content and local exchange of traffic in South Africa mitigated effects of the breaks,"" Brodsky says. However, international Internet speeds are expected to be slow until the cables are repaired.

Repairing the breaks requires sending a specially equipped cable ship to the site, where it must grapple the broken cable ends and haul them on board for repairs. With the boom of submarine cable deployment in recent years, some 46 cable ships are now deployed around the world.

Fortunately one of them, the Leon Thevenin, was in Cape Town Harbor at the time of the breaks. After loading equipment and enduring days of weather delays, it sailed on 22 January with a crew of 54. TENET reported the ship reached the site of the breaks late on 28 January, and is now tweeting reports of repairs estimated to be finished by the end of Saturday, 8 February.

A new generation of submarine cables is in the works, including four expected to reach South Africa in the next three years, each designed to provide more capacity than the present six cables combined now provide. Google Cloud, with its global network of submarine cables, plans to complete the Equiano cable from Portugal to South Africa by 2021; it will have about 20 times the transmission capacity of the most recent cable connected to Africa. Google does not yet have a cloud data center in Africa, but the Equiano cable could pave the way.

Meanwhile, the South Atlantic Express 1 and 2 cables are expected to begin service in the second and third quarters in 2022, with design capacities of 108 and 72 terabits per second. And Facebook is discussing Project Simba to lay a cable to South Africa, but has yet to announce details.

The mystery of what caused a some of the undersea cable cuts in the Middle …

Telecommunications company Reliance Globalcom has announced the results of its investigation into a [rash](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080207-repairs-underway-explanation-elusive-on-cable-failures.html) of cable cuts that occurred earlier this year. According to the company [via](http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/holnus/001200804061763.htm) _The Hindu_, two merchant vessels, the MV Hounslow, and the MT Ann, were responsible for damage that crippled both India and the Middle East's internet access for weeks.

The company's findings do not, in and of themselves, [explain](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080219-undersea-saboteurs-may-have-been-responsible-for-cable-cuts.html) all the cable cuts that occurred in late January/early February, but they do indicate that the timing and placement of the breaks was coincidental. Reliance Globalcom reached its conclusions by studying satellite imagery of the two vessels and their movements over the time period in question. These findings were presumably referenced against the evidence collected by the repair crews that were sent to examine and repair the broken cables.

The diagram above (courtesy of Wikipedia) shows the location of the first two cuts, as well as the paths the optical cables take in and out of the region. More cable cuts occurred than are shown here, but these are the cuts attributed to the two vessels. The damage caused weeks of problems for the Middle East, as all regional Internet traffic was temporarily forced to run over a single, land-based fiber optic cable.

Both the MV Hounslow and the MT Ann were impounded upon reaching Dubai. One of the two—it's not clear which—has already been released after its Korean owners agreed to pay an unstated amount of compensation. The other, Iraqi-owned, ship is in a bit more trouble, however, and sailors on the vessel may be taken to court. There's no information available yet on why the two ships are being treated differently, or why specific sailors, rather than the ship's owners, may be charged with damaging the cable.","The article discusses undersea cable cuts in detail, including direct mentions of 'undersea cable cuts' and the implications for internet connectivity in India and the Middle East.

UPDATE ON 1998 UNDERWATER SALVAGE DIVING EXPEDITION TO RECOVER SAMPLES OF VERY EARLY SUBMARINE TELEGRAPH CABLES

I have always been fascinated by the early transatlantic telegraph cables which linked, for the very first time, Europe and the United States beginning in 1858. As you can imagine, this was an incredible undertaking at the time and it allowed nearly instantaneous communication between the United States and Europe instead of the several-week delay necessitated by using ships to carry the messages.

For a number of years I have been interested in trying to locate and recover some of these very early cables from the depths of the Atlantic ocean. This is a report on this year's (1998) expedition: This year, I was able to recover a total of three long-submerged cables. I recovered two of the cables on solo dives from a boat that I chartered, and the third cable was recovered with the help of a professional dive boat and a professional diver who assisted me in cutting through the cable.

I started out this year's expedition with a trip to several libraries and museums. They have some interesting materials relevant to telegraph cables in their archives and a nice old photograph of a Cable Shack and Cable Tunnel that shows where some of the cables came ashore.

I went to the shoreline to see whether I could find any trace of the shack or of the cable and found a typical condo laden sandy beach with absolutely no sign of any cable. BUT, speaking of cables, I did find a paint splattered WARNING sign which made me very cautious about cutting pieces of the cables that I found in deep water... I went back to the books and double checked that the cables that I planned to cut had been abandoned for over 100 years.

This year I chartered a wonderful sailboat. The weather was absolutely Ideal and the diving was easy. The only problem was the extremely poor visibility near the bottom. Nevertheless, I managed to recover pieces from two different cables on these dives.

The final dive was made from a boat which I chartered from a wonderful dive operation that I have been diving with for over 28 years. A professional diver accompanied me on the dive to help me cut the larger cable. When I got close to the cable, however, I was able to get a very clear photograph of the cable after I had cut it.

After I raised the cable, I kept it moist to prevent it from drying out and starting to rust. I wrapped the cable in several layers of duct tape to prevent it from drying out and, when I reached my home, I cut the duct-tape-wrapped cable into short enough lengths to fit into the electrolytic bath.

The cables were then conserved by electrolysis as I removed the salt which has infiltrated into the iron during the 100+ years under the ocean. For more details, you may want to visit my description of last year's (1997) diving expedition.

Before immersing the cables in the electrolytic bath, I took a photo of the end view of each of the three cables and they are shown below. I will post pictures of the dive trips and more information about the cables as soon as possible. I will also update these pages as I try to recover all six of the underwater cables. They will provide samples of the technological improvements in cables from 1866 to the 1900's and allow me to analyze how well they have survived over 100 years under the ocean.","The article discusses the recovery of submarine telegraph cables, detailing a diving expedition focused on cutting and retrieving these cables from the ocean floor.

The damage was more extensive than originally thought. The cable was probably damaged by a ship’s anchor.**

According to Energinet, the power connection between Bornholm and Sweden was restarted at 18.03 on Saturday, March 26, and the island can be supplied with electricity from outside again.

One of three cables connecting infrastructure in the town of Hasle in Bornholm to Borreby in Sweden was severed on Saturday, February 26 at 6.17, causing a power cut throughout Bornholm. Energinet immediately sent special units to the site to find the cause and begin repairing the cable. While the submarine cable was broken, Bornholm was supplied with electricity from its own generation sources.

Ship Silja spent the first few days surveying the seabed to determine the location and cause of the fault. Ship Vina then secured the cable, which is normally buried in the seabed, to increase its protection from anchors or trawls, for example. Assister repair vessel then lifted the cable onto the ship’s deck, where the ends of the cable were connected to a spare cable installed between them.

Broken cable connecting Bornholm to Sweden at a depth of 50 metres, photo: Energinet

While repairing the cable, other parts of the cable were also found to have obvious damage from anchors, trawls, etc. The old damage, which had not previously caused problems, was severe enough that these sections of cable also needed to be replaced. Consequently, more cable was needed than the approximately 3.3 km wrapped on the first cable drum. A total of 4.1 km of marine cable was cut and replaced with 4.25 km of new cable – the replacement section has to be longer because the cable failure occurred in water depths of approx. 50 m, and the repair is done on the sea surface.

Later investigations showed that the cable was probably pulled through the ship’s anchor. The vessel that was passing over the cable when the failure occurred has been identified and Energinet has initiated insurance proceedings.

If compensation is paid from the ship’s insurance, the sum insured depends on, among other things, the size of the vessel. If the costs exceed the insurance cover compensation, the rest of the costs are paid by Energinet, sp ultimately the Danish electricity consumers.

26 Jan 2025, 9:53 pm

An undersea fibre optic cable between Latvia and Sweden was damaged on Sunday, likely as a result of external influence, Latvia said, triggering an investigation by local and NATO maritime forces in the Baltic Sea.

""We have determined that there is most likely external damage and that it is significant,"" Latvian Prime Minister Evika Silina told reporters following an extraordinary government meeting.

Latvia is coordinating with NATO and the countries of the Baltic Sea region to clarify the circumstances, she said separately in a post on social media.

Latvia's navy earlier on Sunday said it had dispatched a patrol boat to inspect a ship and that two other vessels were also subject to investigation.

Up to several thousand commercial vessels make their way through the Baltic Sea at any given time, and a number of them passed the broken cable on Sunday, data from the _MarineTraffic_ ship tracking service showed.

One such ship, the Malta-flagged bulk carrier _Vezhen_, was closely followed by a Swedish coast guard vessel on Sunday evening, _MarineTraffic_ data showed, and the two were heading in toward the southern Swedish coastline.

It was not immediately clear if the _Vezhen_, which passed the fibre optic cable at 00:45 GMT on Sunday, was subject to investigation.

A Swedish coastguard spokesperson declined to comment on the _Vezhen_ or the position of coastguard ships.

""We are in a stage where we cannot give any information,"" the spokesperson said. ""Exactly how we are involved we cannot say.""

Bulgarian shipping company Navigation Maritime Bulgare, which listed the _Vezhen_ among its fleet, did not immediately reply when called and emailed by Reuters outside of office hours.

NATO cooperation
----------------

Swedish Navy spokesperson Jimmie Adamsson earlier told _Reuters_ it was too soon to say what caused the damage to the cable or whether it was intentional or a technical fault.

""NATO ships and aircrafts are working together with national resources from the Baltic Sea countries to investigate and, if necessary, take action,"" the alliance said in a statement on Sunday.

Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said his country was cooperating closely with NATO and Latvia.

""Sweden will contribute important capabilities to the ongoing effort to investigate the suspected incident,"" Kristersson said on social media.

NATO said last week it would deploy frigates, patrol aircraft and naval drones in the Baltic Sea to help protect critical infrastructure and reserved the right to take action against ships suspected of posing a security threat.

The military alliance is taking the action, dubbed ""Baltic Sentry"", following a string of incidents in which power cables, telecom links and gas pipelines have been damaged in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Finnish police last month seized a tanker carrying Russian oil and said they suspected the vessel had damaged the Finnish-Estonian Estlink 2 power line and four telecoms cables by dragging its anchor across the seabed.

Finland's prime minister in a statement said the latest cable damage highlighted the need to increase protection for critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea.

The cable that broke on Sunday linked the Latvian town of Ventspils with Sweden's Gotland island, and was damaged in Sweden's exclusive economic zone, the Latvian Navy said.

Communications providers were able to switch to alternative transmission routes, the cable's operator, _Latvian State Radio and Television Centre (LVRTC)_, said in a statement, adding it was seeking to contract a vessel to begin repairs.

""The exact nature of the damage can only be determined once cable repair work begins,"" LVRTC said.

A spokesperson for the operator said the cable, laid at depths of more than 50 metres (164 feet), was damaged on early Sunday but declined to give an exact time of the incident.

Unlike seabed gas pipelines and power cables, which can take many months to repair after damage, fibre optic cables that have suffered damage in the Baltic Sea have generally been restored within weeks.

A Swedish Post and Telecom Authority spokesperson said it was aware of the situation but had no further comment.

(Reporting by Andrius Sytas, Janis Laizans, Johan Ahlander, Stine Jacobsen, Nerijus Adomaitis and Terje Solsvik Editing by Christina Fincher, Frances Kerry and Hugh Lawson)","The article titled 'Latvia: Another Baltic undersea cable damaged, likely by external force' discusses the significant damage to an undersea fiber optic cable between Latvia and Sweden.

It explicitly mentions 'undersea cable' multiple times and details the investigation launched by Latvian authorities and NATO, highlighting the incident's seriousness.

The article outlines the implications for connectivity, noting that communications providers could switch to alternative routes while repairs are arranged.

This indicates that the article treats the subject of cut sea cables as a central theme rather than a minor mention.

The context provided shows that this incident is part of a broader concern regarding infrastructure security in the Baltic Sea, further emphasizing its relevance to the criterion."
"Vulnerability of the UK's 60 Internet Cables","Examines the security risks of 60 subsea cables, detailing incidents of cuts and their impact on UK internet connectivity.","https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-vulnerable-are-the-60-internet-cables-that-keep-the-uk-connected-v6lgnrch6","","Tom Whipple; Science Editor",Yes,"Tom Whipple","London, United Kingdom",-,"2023-06-14","English","The Times","On the morning of Thursday October 20 last year, the Shetland Islands very suddenly and without warning left the 21st century.

Somewhere on the sea bed between them and the mainland, a trawler had accidentally pulled up a fibre optic cable and now the internet and landlines were down. The islands were once again alone in the blustery North Sea. It would be days before services were fully restored.

For many residents, what was surprising was the fragility of their connection to the modern world and the ease with which it was severed. Those in the military would have been less surprised.

Almost all internet data travels, ultimately, by cable. There are 60 cables that connect the UK to the rest of the world. Only 200 cables around the world carry 95 per cent of all internet traffic. Each day they also carry $10 trillion of financial transactions. They meet at a small handful of critical nodes, one of which is the UK.

For most of their length these cables just lie on the sea bed — the arteries of modern commerce exposed to the ocean above. Their vulnerability has not gone unnoticed. If it is possible to blow up Nord Stream gas pipelines, defence chiefs argue, it is certainly possible to cut something only slightly thicker than a fat garden hose.

Last year the Ministry of Defence warned of “increased opportunities for adversaries to threaten western subsea critical national infrastructure”. A year earlier it said that Russia was one of the adversaries developing the technology to do just this.

The European parliament made it even more explicit, cautioning about the “potential for sabotaging undersea cables during times of conflict”. In particular, it noted: “Some countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, or Egypt, have a particularly important position in the international cable system, acting as connecting points between political regions.”

Ultimately, the task of cutting a cable is a lot simpler than the task of protecting a cable. As Lawrence of Arabia demonstrated with his attacks on the railways of the Ottoman Empire, long communications lines in unpopulated areas are extremely vulnerable. The defender must guard the whole length, the attacker can choose just one point.

We are not defenceless, however. Royal Navy submarines can monitor underwater activity, and from this year a new ship, the RFA Proteus, will enter service tasked with guarding critical undersea infrastructure. It will act as a mother ship for autonomous vehicles that can inspect and defend cables and pipelines. It will also act as a statement of intent.

Having a dedicated vessel in this role is an acknowledgement of a new reality. “‘Seabed warfare’ is no longer a distant concept,” a recent Nato report said. “It represents an immediate and legitimate threat to Allies.","The article discusses the vulnerability of undersea cables, directly mentioning terms like 'subsea cables' and providing specific examples of incidents where these cables were cut.

It highlights the implications of such events on internet connectivity and discusses the threats posed to these critical infrastructures, making it a central theme of the article."

In October of 2023, Phoenix was contacted by the Ocean Cables and Unmanned Systems Division of the Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (EXWC) to develop an innovative approach to repair the Kaneohe Wave Energy Test Site (WETS) 60M Berth Electro-Opto-Mechanical Cable. Due to the dynamic shoreline environment, the cable had sustained damage along the shore landing riprap. This time sensitive repair was critical to support Wave Energy Converter (WEC) deployment schedules and other site initiatives.

The WETS deep water system contains two cables. One servicing the 80M Berth and the second servicing the 60M Berth. WETS Kaneohe was the first grid connected wave energy test site installed in U.S. waters.

In March 2024, Phoenix received approval to commence the repair and mobilization was initiated. The star asset of this project was a 50-ft by 60-ft modular jack up barge. This barge was outfitted with a Phoenix Palfinger crane, custom cable chutes, 10k winches, a shallow water dive spread and other miscellaneous repair support equipment. The jack up barge provided a stable and reliable work platform on a site known for unfavorable nearshore working conditions.

Once the barge was on site operations commenced. The shore end of the damaged cable was repaired by way of splicing in a new section of cable to the existing offshore leg from the jack up barge positioned offshore in 17-feet of salt water. Approximately 1089-linear feet of cable was pulled offshore with the barge mounted winch. The new cable was spooled off the flatbed mounted power reel to a stand on shore. Cable floats were added at the mean high-water mark as the pull progressed. Both the existing offshore cable and new shore end were jointed in a submersible splice box provided and accomplished by Marmon Utility (Cable OEM). Once jointing and initial testing was complete, the splice box was deployed, and both the cable omega loops, and splice box were fastened to the seabed. The shore end was routed, connected at the beach vault, and final testing satisfactorily completed.

Commenting on the successful completion of the project, Travis Niederhauser, Phoenix Hawaii Area Manager stated, “We are humbled that EXWC entrusted Phoenix to plan and execute this highly visible project. Phoenix personnel, consultants, subcontractors, and suppliers all performed to the highest standard. We are grateful for their support.”

**Content:**  
WHEN THE navies of Britain, Estonia and Finland held a joint exercise in the Baltic Sea earlier this month, their goal was not to hone warfighting skills. Instead, the forces were training to protect undersea gas and data pipelines from sabotage. The drills followed events in October when submarine cables in the region were damaged. Sauli Niinisto, the Finnish president, wondered whether the Chinese ship blamed for the mischief dragged its anchor on the ocean bed “intentionally or as a result of extremely poor seamanship”.  

Submarine cables used to be seen as the internet’s dull plumbing. Now giants of the data economy, such as Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft, are asserting more control over the flow of data, even as tensions between China and America risk splintering the world’s digital infrastructure. The result is to turn undersea cables into prized economic and strategic assets.","The article titled ""Big tech and geopolitics are reshaping the internet’s plumbing"" discusses the strategic importance of submarine cables, particularly in the context of a recent incident where cables in the Baltic Sea were damaged.

In the tense relationship between Russia and the United States, the latest salvo comes via *The New York Times*: According to American military and intelligence officials, Russian submarines and spy ships are ""aggressively operating"" near submarine cables that carry Internet communications, raising concerns of a potential attack ""in times of tension or conflict.""

The submarine cables are obscure, yet incredibly vital infrastructure that basically carries most of the communications around the world. Descendants of the old telegraph networks, fiber-optic data cables snake across the bottom of the oceans, linking continents to each other and shuttling the vast majority of all voice and data traffic.

The *Times* report presents an account from unnamed military and intelligence officials that Russia's naval activities along the known cable routes are raising concerns in the Pentagon:

> ""The ultimate Russian hack on the United States could involve severing the fiber-optic cables at some of their hardest-to-access locations to halt the instant communications on which the West's governments, economies and citizens have grown dependent.""

This would be a new kind of spy operation. In the past, cables have been known to be tapped for secrets (particularly during the Cold War), but possibly much more recently. Cutting the cables is a whole different thing.

""You'd need a lot of submarines to actually harm a country like the United States,"" says Keith Schofield, general manager of the International Cable Protection Committee, whose members collectively oversee almost all of the world's intercontinental submarine cables.

Actually, one submarine per each cable, says Tim Stronge, researcher at TeleGeography, which tracks the commercial submarine cable industry. He says the cables run closer when they're near the shore but track different paths, especially out in the ocean.

That would make it 15 submarines for the 15 cables connecting the eastern U.S. to Europe (the 16th is going into operation soon). ""And if you eliminated all the trans-Atlantic connectivity, well, there's trans-Pacific connectivity you would have to address as well. To cut all those is even more of a fanciful proposition,"" Stronge says.

The reason is that each cable alone, while hugely important to the company that owns it, isn't detrimental to your Internet connection.

""Normally, the traffic is diverted if a cable is cut, because clearly any commercial operator wants to ensure their customers still have service ... . And so the traffic is just automatically re-routed to a good route,"" Schofield tells All Tech.

""It's a bit like saying, 'We're going to intercept every interstate highway in the United States, all at the same time, then you'd have a problem with traffic.' If you intercept one, or two, or 10, you can still reroute around it.""

Stronge also says that much of what regular users look for online, like videos and searches and websites, is hosted domestically and would remain unaffected even in the event of every single U.S.-connected cable going black.

""The industry is built to be robust; it's built for failure,"" he says.

Typically, the owners of the cable systems have to deal with cuts near the shore, caused by fishers or dragging anchors. The cables in shallow waters are often especially armored for those threats. Far in the ocean, they're just tiny fiber-optic wires inside a plastic tube, and rarely get disrupted (usually in natural disasters like earthquakes).

It costs anywhere from tens of thousands to $1 million or more to lift a deep-sea cable from the bottom of the ocean and work on it, according to Schofield and Stronge. That means serious financial costs would be involved in repairing potential damage, but also costs involved in an attack of this sort.

Schofield says the safety of cable network systems is hugely important: ""The world's submarine cable telecoms infrastructure is vital; it's the heartbeat of the Internet."" But he says it would have to be a ""consistent, sustained and diverse"" attack to cause a severe problem.

What if it does?

""Let's say some foreign entity, some evil doer, like a James Bond villain, cut every single undersea fiber-optic cable connection to the United States,"" says Stronge, ""well, we do still have satellite.""","The article titled ""What Would It Take To Cut U.S. Data Cables And Halt Internet Access?"" by Alina Selyukh discusses submarine cables and their significance in internet connectivity.

It directly mentions ""submarine cables"" and discusses the implications of potential attacks on these cables by foreign entities, specifically highlighting concerns from U.S. military officials regarding Russian activities near these cables.

The article elaborates on how cutting these cables could disrupt communications and emphasizes the importance of these cables to global internet infrastructure.

Overall, it treats the topic as central rather than a minor mention, fulfilling the criterion for being an article on cut sea cables."

"Your Data's Strange Undersea Voyage","Explores the disruption of internet connectivity for Tonga due to a severed undersea cable caused by a volcanic eruption, highlighting global communication implications.","https://nautil.us/your-datas-strange-undersea-voyage-1138554","","Charles Digges",Yes,"Charles Digges","New York, NY, United States",-,"2024-11-15","English","Nautilus Magazine","In late December of 2021, the seafloor near the tiny South Pacific Island nation of Tonga began to rumble. The restive Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai volcano was waking up. In the wee hours of January 15, after days of tremors, the bottom of the ocean finally cracked, disgorging the largest explosion on record. Four blasts of molten rock that packed 1 billion tons of force each sent a plume 36 miles into the sky. The blast was so powerful it could be heard in Alaska, 6,000 miles away. For days afterward, lashed by tsunamis and clouded beneath volcanic ash, the Tongans were unable to call for help.

Severed in the eruption was the undersea telecommunications cable that could carry Tongan voices and emails the 514 miles to Fiji, and from there, to the rest of the world. It was as if a drunken god had tripped over the power cable to the collective computer. Screens went dark, phones went silent, and the internet disappeared. The Tongans were all alone.

“We were totally blank from the internet world for at least three days,” said Samisi Panuve, head of Tonga Cable, the company that owns the nation’s subsea connection. In fact, Panuve said, it would take weeks of exacting repair work at sea aboard highly specialized ships for the line to be fully restored.

So much of the cable was damaged that portions of it had to be remanufactured from scratch. In the interim, contemporary staples such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix—to say nothing of telephone calls and text messages—were only flickeringly available via vexingly slow backup satellites. Even now, internet coverage on the island can be a little spotty. It’s still nearly impossible, for instance, to reach the website for the Tonga Cable Company itself, at least from where I sit in the United States.

For so long, the online world has been so available that its heavenly omnipresence is simply assumed. We pick up a smartphone or open our laptops, and our consciousness is seamlessly transported to wherever—be it the ear of your grandmother in Budapest, a hotel reservation site in Jakarta, or an office meeting in Oslo—all at almost the speed of light. But the experience of the Tongans exposes that apparent ubiquity as something a little more precarious. The online world doesn’t simply rain down from The Cloud: It is transported by something far more tangible, far removed from the weightless data swirls that appear to emanate from Silicon Valley. All the electrons of information stored on the internet’s servers may only weigh as much as an apple—but it takes a couple million pounds of wire to get them to your screens.

For the internet to be the truly global service that it is, many of these wires—most of them no thicker than a garden hose—are sunk full fathom five across the bottom of the ocean, where they lay alarmingly vulnerable to fishing nets, ship anchors, currents, shark bites, scuba divers with saws, earthquakes, and, of course, volcanoes. These slender strands of mega-charged fiberoptic cables moving terabits per second account for 95 percent of all international data and voice transfers—volumes that blow satellites out of the sky.

What is more shocking than having the vast bulk of non-physical human interaction carried by something that looks like it comes from the lawn care section of a hardware store, is how comparatively rare disconnection calamities like the one that befell Tonga really are. According to the folks who lay them and fix them, the 870,000 miles of submarine cables invisibly meshing the world together under each of our planet’s oceans demand only about 100 repairs per year—far fewer than their wind- and rain-swept terrestrial cousins.

The telecommunications analytics agency TeleGeography maintains an addictive map of all the world’s undersea cables, which bears a stylistic—and almost metaphoric—resemblance to the map of the London Underground. To access that map, which is stored on a server in London, my web requests may follow a few possible routes, according to TeleGeography’s map. It might leave the continental U.S. through Brookhaven, New York on a cable called Atlantic Crossing-1, surfacing again at Whitesands Bay on the Irish Sea. Or it might disembark via Island Park on Long Island traversing the newer FLAG Atlantic -1 cable to the town of Skewjack on the bony finger of England’s Cornwall coast.

These circuits were on my mind as I spoke with Didier Dillard in France. Dillard is one of those affable engineers whose enthusiasm for his craft makes it possible for him to explain it to anyone. He started in the cable business aboard a cable laying ship in the Mediterranean, and over a couple of decades, he worked his way up to CEO of Orange Marine, a company that has laid 164,000 miles—close to 18 percent—of the world’s operational subsea cables. He’s also whom you call when one breaks—and although Orange Marine wasn’t the company that restored Tonga’s cable (New Jersey-based Subcom was), Dillard knows exactly how it was done.

He came through crisp and clear over a Microsoft Teams video meeting, the 5,000 or so miles of cable between me in New Orleans and him in Paris amounting to only the slightest little visual flickers. I imagined, with no easy way of knowing, that our conversation was piped through the Dunant cable, running from Saint Hilaire-de-Riez on France’s Atlantic Coast to Virginia Beach stateside. As that’s one of the newer transatlantic cables, laid in 2021, we agreed it was a pretty good guess. But the sheer number of routes running between the U.S. Atlantic Coast and Europe meant we couldn’t be positive.

And therein, he told me, lies one of the chief protections of our transoceanic communications: redundancy. Although the companies and telecommunications consortia that own the cables are in competition with one another, Dillard said that each nonetheless rents capacity to others as insurance against a dead line. If, for example, the company BW Digital’s Hawaiki cable is having trouble updating your Instagram from a beach in New Zealand, your attempts to inspire FOMO might instead travel to the U.S. server via the Southern Cross Cable owned by the eponymous Southern Cross Cable Network—or a dozen other circuitous routes owned by various telecom companies.

And this is, of course, what doomed Tonga: its single lonely cable tethering it to the rest of the globe, which was laid in 2013. Michael Clare, who studies how undersea environments interact with subsea infrastructure at Britain’s National Oceanography Center, told me that the violence of the Hunga Tonga eruption surprised everyone. A wall of subsea debris was hurtled more than 60 miles across the seafloor toward Tonga’s cable, according to a paper Clare co-authored. Such force, though, suggests even a redundant system along a similar route might not have kept the Tongans online in their hour of need.

The first truly intercontinental subsea cable was laid in 1866 between Newfoundland and Ireland by the SS Great Eastern, the biggest ship of its day. Made of seven copper coils insulated in gutta-percha—a rubbery substance from the tropical sapodilla tree that’s also used to fill modern-day root canals—this cable established a 2,226-mile telegraph link, run by the Atlantic Telegraph Company. Today, of course, we would consider it intolerably slow. The first official message it carried was a 98-word dispatch of congratulations from Queen Victoria to President James Buchanan that took 16 hours to arrive.","The article ""Your Data's Strange Undersea Voyage"" discusses the severing of the undersea telecommunications cable due to a volcanic eruption near Tonga, which directly impacted internet connectivity for the island.

In addition to a ruptured gas pipeline and two damaged telecom cables connecting three NATO member states, a Russian fiber-optic cable was also reported damaged during roughly the same timeframe, the ministry revealed Monday.

The Balticconnector gas pipeline from Finland to Estonia, an adjacent telecom cable and a second cable from Estonia to Sweden were all damaged in the early hours of October 8. The government of Finland believes that the rupture was caused by ""external"" forces, and a dragged anchor is the primary culprit. Post-accident investigations found a miles-long drag trail leading up to the pipeline, a broken anchor at the damage site, and a smaller drag trail the size of an anchor stock leading away.

Finnish authorities initially suspected a saboteur with a ""certain amount of know-how and special equipment,"" and though not stated explicitly, all eyes turned to Russia. The Russian government had already threatened to take ""military-technical"" steps to retaliate against Finland for joining NATO in April, and it has extensive capabilities for subsea espionage and sabotage.

However, the more recent evidence points to a Chinese-owned ship, the NewNew Polar Bear. The vessel crossed the pipeline at the location of the damage site, and at about the same moment that a faint seismic event was detected near that position. It was later photographed arriving in Archangelsk with what appeared to be an empty port side hawsepipe, missing one anchor.

The NewNew Polar Bear's crew refused to cooperate with investigators, and the ship has long since departed. Finnish authorities are still working to determine whether the damage was intentional.

On Monday, Finland’s Ministry of Economic Affairs reported that a Russian telecom cable was also damaged in the same area, at roughly the same time. The operator of the Baltika cable, Rostelcom, asked for permission to carry out a repair in Finnish waters on October 12, four days after the incident.

Tonga signed a 15-year deal to secure satellite connectivity following an earlier cable break in 2019 from a ship's anchor. But the use of satellite phones has been affected by the volcanic ash blanketing the country. Some people have reported they can only dial out - and not receive calls.

A specialist ship is en route to the area to restore the cable. The ship left Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, about 4,700 km (2,900 miles) away, on January 20 and is expected to reach the area on January 30. The operation is expected to take a few weeks.

The 827 km (514 miles) cable from Fiji to Tonga is one of 436 active undersea cables that connect the globe.

It was not until five days after the volcanic eruption that the country’s major telecom operators could establish a connection to the global internet via satellite, according to network monitoring company Kentik.

However, the capacity of satellite-based internet is greatly constrained, Doug Madory, a network analyst at Kentik, said. “Satellite service in the Pacific is expensive because of the vast coverage area and relatively small population,” he added.

There was no traffic recorded for five days after the eruption, measured in bits per second (hourly average) to all telecom operators in Tonga. Internet traffic picked up in the late hours of Jan. 20 as services were restored via satellite.

Tonga’s cable was laid in 2013 at a cost of $15 million. The World Bank and Asian Development Bank extended grants to help it overcome reliance on expensive satellite-based communication.

Undersea communication cables can vary in size and structure but are roughly the diameter of a garden hose. Although relatively thin, these cables have multiple layers protecting the fibre optic cable at the centre. Despite layers of protection and avoiding accident prone areas, on average, there are 100 cable faults recorded every year according to Telegeograph, a telecommunications research firm.

#### Structure of a subsea cable

Communication cables are made of multiple layers. At the core, the optical fibres are surrounded by silicone gel and encased in a plastic or steel tube. Ultra-high strength steel wires are wrapped around the tube to form a pressure vessel to isolate and protect the optical fibres. This structure sits inside a copper sheath that forms a water seal and conducts power and signals, which is wrapped in a polyethylene jacket that insulates against static electricity and protects it from corrosion. This is contained inside two alternating layers of nylon yarn bedding and crush-resistant galvanised armour wires. The entire cable structure is wrapped in tar-soaked nylon yarn to protect it from ship anchors and shark bites.

Most cable damage occurs due to ship anchors or fishing trawlers and occasionally environmental factors such as earthquakes.

Faults are common and typically most traffic would be rerouted to another cable. However, in Tonga’s case, there is only one cable connecting the country. It also sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, adding an additional risk.

According to Jonathan Brewer, a telecommunications engineer at Telco2 limited, it's better to have multiple cables or multiple cable landing stations to manage the risk of disruption. However, this can be expensive. Pacific islands like Guam and French Polynesia have significant support from the U.S. and French governments enabling them to have such extensive infrastructure.

A ship from Papua New Guinea moves eastward on its way to fix the cable. The Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai volcano is part of a chain of volcanoes along the tectonic plate boundary surrounding Tonga and the islands close by.

The repair ship, CS Reliance, is one of six identical ones owned by SubCom, an undersea cable laying company. It is based in New Caledonia, a French overseas territory west of Tonga, and is one of the largest vessels of its kind.

As of June 2021, there are 59 operational cable laying and maintenance vessels that are periodically deputised to either lay cables or fix faults according to the International Cable Protection Committee.

The ship features a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) which is used for cable installation up to 2,500 m deep, as well as cable-handling machinery and a 65-tonne crane used to lower sea plows. The cable tanks in the belly of the ship can hold 5,466 metric tonnes of cable, enough to cross the Atlantic Ocean. The ship’s bow thrusters can deploy and rotate to keep the vessel in position while operating in rough conditions, and the rear thrusters provide propulsion and maneuverability through 360° of rotation.

A light pulse sent through a fibre optic cable would usually travel to the other end. However, in a broken fibre, the pulse bounces back and engineers are able to measure the time it takes to return in order to locate the break.

“Locating the cable can be a challenge if it's buried or if it's moved far from its original route. If the volcano blast or tsunami shifted or collapsed a seamount on top of the cable, it could be very difficult to locate or retrieve,” said Brewer.

A deep sea hook is lowered which cuts the cable into two. One end of the cable is held by a buoy and the other is brought onto the deck. The cable is spliced and repaired onboard with a new joint assembly.

After the splicing is completed, the cables are attached to each other and are wrapped in multiple protective layers so they withstand pressure and environmental damage.

The cables are then joined onboard the vessel and gently lowered back down to the sea floor in a hairpin pattern.

Also subject to the conditions to the seabed, the cable-laying vessel may tow a sea plow across the ocean floor to bury the cable.

A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) may descend to the seabed to inspect and help bury the cable, although they can only work to a certain depth. In the case of the Reliance, the vehicle can descend up to 2,500 meters.

The plow helps bury the cable and the vehicle, like a remote controlled robot, is lowered down to the seabed nearby to enable inspection using its camera and a light. The vehicle can go to a maximum depth of 2,500 meters.

Most of these cables have an approximate life span of about 25 years and are usually retired and replaced with newer ones. Some are salvaged for their raw materials that can be repurposed.

"Undersea Data Cables Vulnerable to Sabotage","Examines incidents of cable cutting, including a 2007 event affecting internet connectivity, revealing significant risks to undersea data infrastructure.","https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news-features/all-at-sea","","Danny Bradbury",Yes,"Danny Bradbury","Richmond, Surrey, United Kingdom",-,"2023-02-06","English","Infosecurity Magazine","When you watch Netflix, deal with your email or make a Skype call, the traffic travels along a relatively small number of routes to its destination. Like most of the world’s internet traffic, it travels via submarine cables, typically the width of a garden hose. Today, there are 356 of these cables spread across the world. How safe are they from attack or disruption?

These cables run between continents, channelling terabits of information down a single fibre-optic link. They are incredibly expensive to build, with a transatlantic link costing around $500 million, and only a handful of firms have the ability to lay them.

Laying the cables is a tricky business. Out in deep ocean waters, there are few threats to the integrity of a cable, and cable-laying ships will simply let them fall unprotected to the sea floor. As the cables get closer to the shore, though, the ocean bed becomes shallower, and more threatening. Wayward anchors can easily sever a cable. Consequently, for several miles before they come ashore they’re protected by strong metal sheathing. When they hit land, they’ll typically connect to land-based fibre cables in trenches protected by manhole covers or in anonymous-looking concrete shacks.

There are two kinds of potential attack on the submarine cable system. The first involves denial of service by disruption.

Information about cable locations is documented by several organizations including the National Oceanographic Data Center (DMA/NOAA) in the US and the UK’s Admiralty Hydrographic Office. If a cable’s ingress point is relatively unprotected, then wouldn’t a determined adversary be able to disrupt internet service – and therefore key parts of the critical national infrastructure – by simply blowing one up?

It’s a risk, admits Tim Stronge, vice president of research at telecommunications research firm TeleGeography. In the deep sea, attackers are effectively targeting a piece of garden hose. “At the beach, it might be a little harder but a determined adversary could damage where the cable comes in or they could damage or blow up a facility where the traffic is exchanged,” he says.

There are a handful of cases in which cables have been cut intentionally. In 2007, fishing trawlers near Vietnam did just that, pilfering 61 miles of undersea cables for copper content, taking out cables in southeast Asia for several months in the process.

The answer to these risks is safety in numbers, argues Stronge. In many developed countries, multiple cables land in different parts of the country. If one cable were to be disrupted, then there would be others that could take up the slack.

“The fact that the cable breaks a lot and Americans and Europeans hardly hear about it is because there is so much failover,” he says.

Some undersea cables are also structured with their own redundancy, Stronge points out. The Southern Cross cable that connects the US with Australia was laid in a built-in redundant ring formation that can fail over in the event of a break, he says.

Keith Schofield, general manager of the International Cable Protection Committee, adds that many submarine cables have far more capacity, thanks to technologies that make the capacity upgradable by enhancing equipment at either end.

“It’s rare for those cables to be full on day one”, he says. So if one cable is cut, another can take up the slack.

How many cables would an attacker have to sever to bring down a country’s internet? It depends on the region. Southeast Asia in particular is constrained by two things. First, it faces a lack of diversity. Lots of licensees want the same routes to minimise latency, resulting in high concentrations of traffic, and the cables are clustered into choke points. A 2016 Verizon report identified historically proven single points of failure in this region and across the north and eastern coast of Africa.

The second constraint in the Indian ocean concerns national policy. There are a finite number of repair ships that can hoist cable from the sea floor and repair it using splicing equipment. In some regions, such as Indonesia, a ‘cabotage’ policy that favours locally-owned vessels can hold up repairs. That is gradually changing, says Schofield.

“Now, nations are beginning to realise that it’s not in their citizen’s interest to restrict access to the Internet,” he says.

More generally, situations have arisen where it has taken time for a vessel to become available and get to the repair point. The more outages that happen at once, the greater the overhead on the repair assets. A concerted attack could theoretically cause significant problems.

**Submarine snooping**

The second kind of attack is more covert: tapping the cables directly to snoop on information. This has been done domestically, says Telegeography’s Stronge, because the Snowden files tell us so. BLARNEY and FAIRVIEW were all data gathering projects which involved “collection of communications on fiber cables and infrastructure as data flows past,” according to a leaked NSA document. These could just as easily be harvested with the operators’ collaboration, which has happened on several occasions.

What about foreign governments snooping on a nation state’s cable operation? Would it be possible to splice the cable using the same equipment used to repair it? It would be difficult, argues ICPC’s Schofield, because operators would sense differences in signals on a tapped line. However, the US has equipped military vessels such as the SS Jimmy Carter with cable splicing mechanisms in the past.

**Need for international governance**

We shouldn’t overcook the risks associated with undersea cable, warn experts, but they are there. This is why the ICPC earlier this year identified several security gaps that should be filled. It wants tighter laws to punish intentional cable destruction in international waters, because currently, few if any penalties exist. Penalties for destroying cables inside national waters are also woefully mild, Schofield adds.

Nations should cut through the red tape, getting rid of “cabotage” and other restrictions, to expedite the repair process, he added.

Finally, co-ordination is key, he warns. He wants desktop-style exercises between the ICPC and multiple states to play out procedures for repairing cables. At a national level, he wants countries including the US to overcome the ‘too many cooks’ problem. Several government agencies have jurisdiction over some element of submarine cables, but there is no one agency with total oversight. That impedes co-ordinated protection of the cable ecosystem, he warns, adding that Australia and Singapore have rationalized submarine cable control with effective results.

It would take a concerted attack on the cable infrastructure to make a dent in it. After all, the internet itself was designed to route itself around damage. But the risks are there. While the authorities work slowly to improve its resilience, some countries are taking ownership themselves. Facebook and Microsoft are both laying their own cable, and Google’s is already live. That represents yet another layer of vertical integration for these hyperscale firms – and just a little more peace of mind.","The article discusses undersea cables, focusing on their vulnerabilities to cuts and sabotage.

"Modernizing Outdated Laws for Undersea Cables","Discusses the urgent need to update laws governing undersea cables, citing the disruption of Tonga's connectivity due to a cable break linked to a volcanic eruption.","https://gcaptain.com/outdated-laws-governing-undersea-cables-need-modernizing","","Editorial",Yes,"Author: Editorial","Morro Bay, California, United States.","10000","2022-01-30","English","gCaptain","**Title: Outdated Laws Governing Undersea Cables Need Modernizing**  
**Published Date:** 01/30/2022  

Karen Scott, [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/laws-governing-undersea-cables-have-hardly-changed-since-1884-tonga-is-a-reminder-they-need-modernising-175312)–Since the [catastrophic volcanic eruption on January 16](https://gcaptain.com/massive-tonga-volcano-eruption-triggers-pacific-tsunami/), Tonga has been largely cut off from the world due to a [break in the undersea cable that links Tonga](https://gcaptain.com/cable-repair-ship-to-arrive-tonga-on-sunday/) with Fiji (and from there with the world). A complete fix may take weeks.  

Aside from the distress and inconvenience this is causing, Tonga’s predicament demonstrates a more general vulnerability of our global communication system.  

Over 95% of the world’s data travels along the 436 submarine cables – around 1.3 million kilometres long in total – that connect all continents except Antarctica. These cables carry data integral to the internet, communication, and financial and defence systems worldwide.  

There are natural hazards, as the Tonga eruption so graphically demonstrated. But the greatest threat to submarine cables is from fishing. Despite the cables being clearly marked on maritime charts, about 70% of damage is caused accidentally by gear such as trawl nets, dredges, long lines and fish aggregation devices.  

But there is also concern that the [cables are increasingly vulnerable to terrorism and cyberwarfare](https://gcaptain.com/opinion-chinas-targeting-underwater-internet-cables/) by private and state actors. As the head of the UK’s armed forces warned very recently:  

_Russian submarine activity is threatening underwater cables that are crucial to communication systems around the world._

**An outdated convention**  
Given their fundamental importance to modern global communication, then, it would be natural to assume the international rules protecting submarine cables have been revised to respond to new technology and new challenges.  

Not so. The international legal regime for protecting and managing submarine cables has remained largely unchanged since 1884 when the Convention for the Protection of Submarine Telegraph Cables was adopted. It remains in force today, with 36 party states (including New Zealand and Australia, which acceded in 1888 and 1901 respectively).  

The convention makes it an offence to break or damage a submarine cable, wilfully or by culpable negligence (unless such action is necessary to save life). It also provides that only the state within which a vessel is registered (the “flag state”) can take action against its vessels and those on board.  

If the owner of a cable breaks or damages another cable when laying or repairing their own, they must bear the cost of repairing the breakage or damage. Vessel owners who sacrifice an anchor, net or other fishing gear to avoid damaging a cable can receive compensation from the owner of the cable.  

**Who controls a cable?**  
These provisions go back to not long after the first international submarine communication cable was laid between Britain and France in 1850 – it was destroyed by a French fishing vessel within 24 hours.  

By 1858, the age of submarine cables and international communication had begun with the laying of the first transatlantic cable connecting Britain and the US, although it failed after about a month and was replaced in 1866.  

In 1902, the so-called “[All Red](http://blogs.mhs.ox.ac.uk/innovatingincombat/british-cable-telegraphy-world-war-one-red-line-secure-communications/)” route linked New Zealand and Australia with Vancouver through the Pacific Ocean and on to Europe through the Trans-Canada and Atlantic lines.  

In 1986, the first fibre optic cable was laid between the UK and Belgium, beginning the modern revolution in global communication.  

The 19th-century principles governing undersea cables have since been incorporated into the modern law of the sea, codified by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), ratified by 168 nations.  

Under UNCLOS all states have a right to lay cables and pipelines on the seabed and continental shelf up to the 12 nautical mile limit. To run a cable to shore through another state’s territorial sea, a state needs the permission of the coastal state.  

But beyond the territorial sea, the power of the coastal state to prevent or impose conditions on where a cable is laid is extremely limited. The 1884 convention rules relating to offences and liability have been incorporated into UNCLOS with minimal amendment.  

**Time for modern laws**  
There are a number of problems with the current rules. First, outside of the territorial sea, the only state that can take action against a vessel that breaks a cable is the vessel’s own flag state.  

While some flag states are responsible and have adopted appropriate legislation – as New Zealand has done with the Submarine Cables and Pipelines Protection Act 1996 – many others have not.  

Moreover, the state with an interest in the cable – through ownership or because the cable ultimately connects to its shore – is normally not able take action against a vessel damaging the cable.  

Generally, the law does not address issues such as physical separation between different cables or their distance from other undersea activities such as mining. Nor does it cover maintaining consistent information on maritime charts, or co-ordination between industries and states.  

The [International Cable Protection Committee](https://www.iscpc.org/), a private organisation comprising 180 state and commercial members representing 97% of the world’s submarine telecom cables, issued a voluntary [guide to best practice](https://www.iscpc.org/publications/icpc-best-practices/) in 2021 that addressed some of these issues – but is this enough?  

Given the potentially catastrophic impact on communications, the economy and defence of losing major cables to accident or nefarious activity, the answer is arguably no. The rules, largely unchanged since 1884, need modernising.","The article titled 'Outdated Laws Governing Undersea Cables Need Modernizing' provides a comprehensive discussion on undersea cables, specifically focusing on the implications of their damage, including a direct mention of the break in the undersea cable that links Tonga to Fiji following a volcanic eruption.

Behind these everyday miracles lies an unseen, sprawling web of undersea cables, quietly powering the instant global communications that people have come to rely on.

Undersea cables, also known as submarine communications cables, are fiber-optic cables laid on the ocean floor and used to transmit data between continents. These cables are the backbone of the global internet, carrying the bulk of international communications, including email, webpages and video calls. More than 95% of all the data that moves around the world goes through these undersea cables.

These cables are capable of transmitting multiple terabits of data per second, offering the fastest and most reliable method of data transfer available today. A terabit per second is fast enough to transmit about a dozen two-hour, 4K HD movies in an instant. Just one of these cables can handle millions of people watching videos or sending messages simultaneously without slowing down.

About 485 undersea cables totaling over 900,000 miles sit on the ocean floor. These cables span the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, as well as strategic passages such as the Suez Canal and isolated areas within oceans.

Laying cable under the sea
Each undersea cable contains multiple optical fibers, thin strands of glass or plastic that use light signals to carry vast amounts of data over long distances with minimal loss. The fibers are bundled and encased in protective layers designed to withstand the harsh undersea environment, including pressure, wear and potential damage from fishing activities or ship anchors. The cables are typically as wide as a garden hose.

The process of laying undersea cables starts with thorough seabed surveys to chart a map in order to avoid natural hazards and minimize environmental impact. Following this step, cable-laying ships equipped with giant spools of fiber-optic cable navigate the predetermined route.

As the ship moves, the cable is unspooled and carefully laid on the ocean floor. The cable is sometimes buried in seabed sediments in shallow waters for protection against fishing activities, anchors and natural events. In deeper areas, the cables are laid directly on the seabed.

Along the route, repeaters are installed at intervals to amplify the optical signal and ensure data can travel long distances without degradation. This entire process can take months or even years, depending on the length and complexity of the cable route.

Threats to undersea cables
Each year, an estimated 100 to 150 undersea cables are cut, primarily accidentally by fishing equipment or anchors. However, the potential for sabotage, particularly by nation-states, is a growing concern. These cables, crucial for global connectivity and owned by consortia of internet and telecom companies, often lie in isolated but publicly known locations, making them easy targets for hostile actions.

The vulnerability was highlighted by unexplained failures in multiple cables off the coast of West Africa on March 14, 2024, which led to significant internet disruptions affecting at least 10 nations. Several cable failures in the Baltic Sea in 2023 raised suspicions of sabotage.

The strategic Red Sea corridor has emerged as a focal point for undersea cable threats. A notable incident involved the attack on the cargo ship Rubymar by Houthi rebels. The subsequent damage to undersea cables from the ship’s anchor not only disrupted a significant portion of internet traffic between Asia and Europe but also highlighted the complex interplay between geopolitical conflicts and the security of global internet infrastructure.

Protecting the cables
Undersea cables are protected in several ways, starting with strategic route planning to avoid known hazards and areas of geopolitical tension. The cables are constructed with sturdy materials, including steel armor, to withstand harsh ocean conditions and accidental impacts.

Beyond these measures, experts have proposed establishing “cable protection zones” to limit high-risk activities near cables. Some have suggested amending international laws around cables to deter foreign sabotage and developing treaties that would make such interference illegal.

The recent Red Sea incident shows that help for these connectivity challenges might lie above rather than below. After cables were compromised in the region, satellite operators used their networks to reroute internet traffic. Undersea cables are likely to continue carrying the vast majority of the world’s internet traffic for the foreseeable future, but a blended approach that uses both undersea cables and satellites could provide a measure of protection against cable cuts.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, mentioning that 'each year, an estimated 100 to 150 undersea cables are cut,' which indicates a direct focus on the topic of cut sea cables.

It provides specific examples of incidents, such as cable failures off the coast of West Africa and damage from the attack on the cargo ship Rubymar, highlighting the implications of these cuts on global connectivity.

If you're reading this outside continental North America, you almost certainly used a submarine cable to get it.  
With the exception of Antarctica, which relies on satellites, overseas internet, phone and fax communication almost exclusively run on undersea fibre optic cables. And those cables cross the seas all over the map.  
TeleGeography has an interactive map on their website showing 343 submarine cables, in service and planned. And the number keeps growing.

**Content companies the new big consumers**  
Here are some numbers that may make you wonder whether this could have something to do with Google, Facebook and Microsoft.  
In 2014, the bandwidth used by those companies and other content providers exceeded other internet bandwidth use on the transatlantic cables for the first time.  
Content providers such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft helped increase global bandwidth demand by 44 per cent last year.  

**Frequent cable breaks**  
TeleGeography researcher Tim Stronge says a cable break happens so often, about twice a week, that it's ""a ho-hum event"" — but an expensive one.  
About two-thirds of the breaks are caused by anchors or fishing trawlers, the rest mostly by undersea earthquakes and volcanoes and other natural events.

**Protecting the cables**  
Some countries require vessels of a certain size to have a transponder so they will be detected, and warned, when they are over a fibre optic cable.  

**What if?**  
What if someone wanted to cut transatlantic telecommunication?  
Fifteen cables handle that traffic, and ships are out in the Atlantic right now laying the sixteenth. So 16 cables would have to be cut.

> The undersea cables are prone to shark attacks which may lead to losses if there are no other alternative routes to connect them to other parts of the world.

If true, such news is worrisome considering shark attacks on fiber optic lines were first noted over 20 years ago. Time Magazine even [wrote a story](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,964701,00.html) on the subject. At that time, AT&T was testing a fiber optic line in the Canary Islands at a relatively shallow depth. Shark teeth were discovered embedded in parts of the cable and researchers scrambled to solve the mystery.

Unlike short-haul terrestrial fiber cables or old copper cables where the fiber did not emit noticeable fields, undersea cables must carry high voltage power to the undersea repeaters, which result in both electric and magnetic fields around and along the cable. A significant 50 Hz field is caused by AC current induced into the power feed system for the cable. In addition, a weak low-frequency field is generated by the DC current on the cable. Some sharks mistaken the electric fields for distressed fish and attempt to feed on the cable. Sharks also bite the cables as they are deployed, recovered, or lifted for repair.

What happens when a shark bite tears into a fiber optic cable? Underwater.com [explains in detail](http://www.underwater.com/archives/arch/septoct00.06.shtml):

> When the deepwater sharks bit into the light wave cable, the teeth penetrated the medium density polyethylene (MDPE) jacket on the cable. This exposed the copper tube, surrounding the core of the cable, to seawater. The electric current, which flows through the copper tube to power the amplifiers, arced into the sea and short-circuited the power system, causing the cable to lay lifeless at 9,000 feet (2,744 m).

Since the costs of unearthing and repairing a cable are not cheap, measures have been taken to prevent damage by curious sharks. The results of the testing showed that the layers of 0.15 millimeter steel and a high density 0.05 millimeter polyethylene jacket protect that insulation from shark attack. Generally, sharks do not feed below 1,500m, so only cables shallower than this depth need extra reinforcement from sharks. However, boat anchors are still a risk.

African undersea cables will not last for long if they are easily damaged and require costly maintenance. However, it seems unlikely that the cables would be susceptible to shark attacks after hundreds of millions of dollars of planning and investment. Either way, no one can criticize the telecoms for taking the time to ensure network stability.","The article titled ""Do sharks still bite undersea fiber optic cables?"" directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables by discussing how shark bites can damage undersea fiber optic cables.

It provides historical context, noting that shark attacks on cables have been documented for over 20 years, and mentions specific incidents where sharks have bitten into cables, causing significant damage.

The article also discusses the implications of these incidents for telecommunications, emphasizing the potential downtime and costs associated with repairing damaged cables.

Furthermore, it outlines preventive measures that telecom companies are taking to protect their infrastructure from such attacks.

This comprehensive coverage indicates that the article treats the topic of cut sea cables as a central theme rather than a minor mention."
"Severed Deep-Sea Cable Disrupts Service","Disruption of internet and TV services for 400,000 customers due to a severed cable 30 miles off Kihei, Maui; outlines repair complexities and potential causes.","https://www.staradvertiser.com/2010/07/28/hawaii-news/severed-deep-sea-cable-disrupts-service","","None",Yes,"None","Honolulu, Hawaii","12500","2010-07-28","English","Honolulu Star-Advertiser","**Severed deep-sea cable disrupts service**

Norman Santos, Oceanic Time Warner Cable vice president of operations, holds a sample of the fiber-optic cable that was severed 30 miles off of Kihei, Maui, resulting in a loss of coverage since yesterday morning.

When it comes to repairing a severed fiber-optic cable 3,000 feet under the sea, it won’t be as simple as calling the cable guy.

""Wish it was,"" said Cliff Miyake, general manager of tw telecom, which co-owns the severed cable that interrupted service for hours to about 400,000 Oceanic Time Warner Cable customers here yesterday. ""It could be a very costly repair.""

At about 1:10 a.m., Oceanic Time Warner started seeing disruptions. It was later discovered that part of a fiber-optic cable was severed about 30 miles off Kihei, Maui.

Most, if not all, Internet service was restored by yesterday afternoon. TV service on Maui and the Big Island was the last to be restored because of the cut’s proximity to both counties.

Oceanic Time Warner rents bandwidth from the fiber-optic cable, co-owned by Colorado-based tw telecom and Wavecom Solutions, formerly Pacific Lightnet. Tw telecom was part of Time Warner Cable but became an independent entity in 2008.

Oceanic Time Warner is among 144 Maui firms that rent bandwidth from that section of the cable. That section went online in 1997, Miyake said.

When the cable was cut, Internet protocol addresses did not know which route to take back to the mainland. Oceanic crews had to reroute connections through alternate cables connecting the islands.

""We have a daisy-chain fiber connection that connects all the islands together,"" said Norman Santos, Oceanic’s vice president of operations. ""The main transmission point for Oceanic Cable is here on Oahu.""

Oahu and Kauai services were restored by 8 a.m. yesterday. Maui and Big Island services were restored by yesterday afternoon.

""We have a disaster recovery plan,"" Miyake said. ""There was another separate system we had access to, so we worked to get that up and running, and that’s what we’ll be using.""

It was not immediately known how the cable was cut. Initial indications seem to point to the possibility that water may have seeped into the cable, but Santos said crews cannot be sure until they see the cable itself.

A cable repair ship must be contracted by owners tw telecom and use pontoons to float the cable up to the service for repair. The process is likely to take up to five weeks, Santos said.

The cable is a Prisma DT digital transport system by Georgia-based Scientific-Atlanta Inc., which is now part of Cisco Systems Inc., according to Star-Advertiser files.

The system delivers Oceanic’s video-on-demand and cable channel programming, major broadcast television programming, residential high-speed cable modem service and high-speed data service for government clients.

Maui County officials reported that offices with phone numbers that have the 270 prefix were unable to receive or make phone calls due to a disruption of service. Also affected were offices at the county building in Wailuku and administrative offices of the Wailuku Police and Fire departments.

Big Island Civil Defense said there was a ""minor inconvenience"" with Internet service. However, the agency also uses DSL Internet connections.

State Civil Defense, which uses a special dedicated line provided by Oceanic, did record that a break occurred, but it did not affect its Internet, said Shelly Ichishita, state spokeswoman.

Bank of Hawaii experienced phone problems with service on Maui and the Big Island, but full service was restored at 10:30 a.m.

Russell Pang, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office, said the state government does not use Oceanic for any of its phone service.

Hawaiian Telcom services were not affected by the undersea cable cut, but made its interisland fiber-optic cable network available to assist residents and businesses on the Big Island, Maui, Molokai and Lanai during the cable repair process, said Hawaiian Telcom President and Chief Executive Officer Eric Yeaman in a written statement.

Oceanic users having problems connecting with Oceanic Roadrunner Internet service may have to reboot by unplugging the cable modem for 20 seconds and then plugging it back in.

Santos said Oceanic is still evaluating whether to allow claims on loss of business due to yesterday’s outage. Oceanic has a policy to not respond to claims unless the outage was longer than 24 hours, but Santos acknowledged that yesterday’s outage was a unique circumstance.

""This is not normal,"" Santos said. ""We’ll make the determination, and once we know the final remedy, we’ll go from there.""","The article titled 'Severed deep-sea cable disrupts service' provides detailed coverage of an incident where a fiber-optic cable was severed approximately 30 miles off Kihei, Maui.

It discusses the immediate effects of this disruption on about 400,000 customers of Oceanic Time Warner Cable, highlighting the loss of internet and TV services and the complexities involved in repairing such a deep-sea cable.

The article describes the potential causes of the cable cut, including the possibility of water intrusion, and outlines the steps taken to restore service, indicating its focus on the implications of the severed cable.

This aligns well with the criterion of discussing cut sea cables comprehensively rather than just briefly mentioning related topics.

Therefore, the article satisfies the criterion."
"Cable Breakage: When and How Cables Go Down","Over 100 annual submarine cable faults primarily caused by fishing vessels and anchor drags; discusses impact on internet connectivity and redundancy strategies.","https://blog.telegeography.com/what-happens-when-submarine-cables-break","","Alan Mauldin",Yes,"Alan Mauldin","Washington, DC, USA","3764","2019-09-30","English","TeleGeography","Earlier this year we fielded some of the most frequently asked questions about submarine cables. How do they work? How thick are they? How many kilometers of cable are there?

Today, we're going back under the sea to talk about what happens when bad things happen to good submarine cables.

And remember—if you have more queries about submarine cables that we haven't covered in our blog yet, tweet it to us @TeleGeography.

### Do cables break?

Yes! Cable faults are common. On average, there are over 100 each year.

You rarely hear about these cable faults because most companies that use cables follow a “safety in numbers” approach to usage, spreading their networks' capacity over multiple cables so that if one breaks, their network will run smoothly over other cables while service is restored on the damaged one.

Unintentional damage from fishing vessels and ships dragging anchors account for two-thirds of all cable faults.

Environmental factors like earthquakes also contribute to damage. Less commonly, underwater components can fail. Deliberate sabotage and shark bites are exceedingly rare.

### I’ve heard that sharks are known for biting cables. Is that not true?

This is probably one of the biggest myths that we see cited in the press. While it’s true that in the past sharks have bitten a few cables, they are not a major threat.

According to data from the International Submarine Cable Protection Committee, fish bites (a category that includes sharks) accounted for zero cable faults between 2007 and 2014.

The majority of damage to submarine cables comes from human activity, primarily fishing and anchoring, not sharks.

### What happens to cables when they are old and turned off?

Cables are engineered with a minimum design life of 25 years, but there is nothing magical about this time span.

Cables may remain operational longer than 25 years, but they’re often retired earlier because they’re economically obsolete. They just can’t provide as much capacity as newer cables at a comparable cost, and are thus too expensive to keep in service.

When a cable is retired it could remain inactive on the ocean floor. Increasingly, there are companies that are gaining the rights to cables, pulling them up, and salvaging them for raw materials.

In some cases, retired cables are repositioned along other routes. To accomplish this task, ships recover the retired cable and then re-lay it along a new path. New terminal equipment is deployed at the landings stations. This approach can sometimes be a cost-effective method for countries with small capacity requirements and limited budgets.","The article titled ""Cable Breakage: When and How Cables Go Down"" discusses various aspects of submarine cables, including their vulnerabilities and the causes of faults.

It frequently refers to ""submarine cables"" and ""cable faults,"" which are directly related to the topic of cut sea cables.

The article provides a comprehensive overview of the reasons for cable faults, emphasizing that over 100 cable faults occur each year, predominantly due to unintentional damage from fishing vessels and ships dragging anchors.

This directly addresses the implications of cut sea cables.

Furthermore, it implies the impact of cable faults on internet connectivity by noting that companies spread their network capacity over multiple cables to ensure that service continues smoothly even when one cable breaks.

The consistent use of terms like ""submarine cables"" and ""cable faults"" reinforces that the article is focused on the topic, and the discussion of cable breakage is a central theme of the article, not a minor mention.

Therefore, the article satisfies the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables."

**Deep Sea Diving**  
February 2020

Last month I attended the New Zealand Network Operators' Group meeting ([NZNOG'20](http://www.nznog.org/nznog-2020)). One of the more interesting talks for me was given by Cisco's Beatty Lane-Davis on the current state of subsea cable technology. There is something quite compelling about engineering a piece of state-of-the-art technology that is intended to be dropped off a boat and then operate flawlessly for the next twenty-five years or more in the silent depths of the world's oceans! It brings together advanced physics, marine technology and engineering to create some truly amazing pieces of communications infrastructure.

### A Potted (and Regionally Biased) History of Subsea Cables

On the 5th August 1856, after a couple of false starts, the Atlantic Telegraph Company completed the first trans-Atlantic submarine telegraph cable. It was a simple affair with seven copper conductor wires, wrapped with three coats of the new wonder material, gutta-percha (or as we know it today, rubber). This was further wrapped in tarred hemp and an 18-strand helical sheath of iron wires. It didn't last long, as the cable company’s electrical engineer, Dr Wildman Whitehouse, had a preferred remedy for a fading signal by increasing the voltage on the circuit...

Over the ensuing years techniques improved, with the addition of in-line amplifiers (or repeaters) to allow the signal to be propagated across longer distances, and progressive improvements in signal processing to improve the capacity of these systems. Telegraph turned to telephony, valves turned to transistors and polymers replaced rubber, but the basic design remained the same: a copper conductor sheathed in a watertight insulating cover, with steel jacketing to protect the cable in the shallower landing segments.

In the Australian context the first telegraph system, completed in 1872, using an overland route to Darwin, and then short undersea segments to connect to Singapore and from there to India and the UK.

Such cables were used for telegraphy, and the first trans-oceanic telephone systems were radio-based; it took some decades for advances in electronics to offer a cable-based voice service...

These days there are just under 400 submarine cables in service around the world, and 1.2 million km of cable. Telegeography’s [cable map](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/) is a comprehensive resource that shows this cable inventory.

### Ownership

The first cable systems were incredibly expensive undertakings as compared to the size of the economies that they serviced. The high construction and operating costs made the service unduly prohibitive to most potential users...

The internet construction boom in the 1990s coincided with large scale deregulation of many telco markets. This allowed other entities to obtain cable landing rights in many countries, which led to the entrance of carrier wholesalers into the submarine cable market, and also led to the concept of ""wholly owned capacity"" on cable system. Early entrants in these markets were wholesale providers to the emerging ISP sector, such as Global Crossing, for example, but it was not long for the large content enterprises, including Google, Facebook and others to enter this submarine cable capacity market with their own investments. The essential difference in this form of operation is the elimination of price setting, allowing cable pricing to reflect prevailing market conditions of supply and demand.

### Cables

The basic physical cable design that's used today for these subsea systems is much the same as the early designs. The signal bearer itself has changed from copper to fibre, but the remainder of the cable is much the same...","The article titled 'ISP Column' discusses subsea cables extensively, including their history, construction, and significance in telecommunications.

Zoom calls between London and Singapore would lag and glitch. Connectivity would persist—packets would be rerouted through America, or through space via satellites—but not without major slowdowns.

The submarine-cable system carries 99% of intercontinental internet traffic. A subsea fibre-optic cable gets cut every three days or so, according to TeleGeography, a consultancy, often because of fishing or an anchor dragging across the ocean floor. Yet the digital world rarely misses a trick for two very physical reasons. The first is that with 552 (active and planned) subsea cables spanning 1.4m kilometres, there is enough redundancy in most places to make up for cable failures (see map). The second reason is that a fleet of 60 repair ships around the world are on stand-by to fix broken cables.

**Repairs have finally** commenced on three subsea telecommunications cables that were damaged in the Red Sea in February, even as Houthi militants escalate their attacks on ships in the area.

The AAE-1 cable, a 25 000km fibre-optic link between Asia and Europe, was repaired by a ship owned by E-Marine, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi-based Emirates Telecommunications Group. The cable came online this week, a Yemeni government official said. The same ship, Niwa, remains in Yemeni waters to repair the remaining two cables, Seacom and EIG.

The cables, among more than a dozen that run through the Red Sea, were severed by the anchor of a cargo ship sunk by Iran-backed Houthi militants in late February.

Repairs to the cables have depended on gaining access to infrastructure in Yemen’s waters, a task complicated by the country’s split government and the fact the Red Sea is a conflict zone. It has taken months of negotiations involving the cable operators and the two factions that control Yemen — the internationally recognised government in the south and the Houthi-backed government in Sanaa — to arrange for the repair mission.

“These are some of the biggest data highways connecting Europe, Middle East, India and Asia,” said Roderick Beck, a consultant who sources network capacity on subsea cables for telecoms clients. “The downtime has forced carriers to completely reroute traffic by building new digital highways stitched together using new cables at considerable expense and working around the clock.”

Although the telecoms data that passes along the damaged cables was rerouted, the incident highlighted the vulnerability of critical subsea infrastructure and the challenges of making repairs in the Red Sea, one of the world’s most important shipping lanes and a conflict zone since late 2023.

…

It’s not clear how the AAE-1 cable consortium was able to [obtain a permit](https://subtelforum.com/yemen-government-probes-delay-aae-1-cable-repairs/).

The Fiber Cuts in the Middle East are getting a lot of attention. The economic damage is real and the geopolitical issues are extremely complex (which is why I edited my earlier post). From an operations perspective these kinds of outages are nothing new, and underscore why having “many eggs in few baskets” is such a problem. I believe we will see similar incidents when we have the first multi-datacenter failures where multiple providers lose significant parts of their infrastructure in a single geographic area. (Remember: location is a basket too!)  

To really understand the current issue, I recommend Neal Stephenson’s incredible (and lengthy) Wired article from 1996 entitled ""Mother Earth Mother Board"":  

> It sometimes seems as though every force of nature, every flaw in the human character, and every biological organism on the planet is engaged in a competition to see which can sever the most cables. The Museum of Submarine Telegraphy in Porthcurno, England, has a display of wrecked cables bracketed to a slab of wood. Each is labeled with its cause of failure, some of which sound dramatic, some cryptic, some both: trawler maul, spewed core, intermittent disconnection, strained core, teredo worms, crab’s nest, perished core, fish bite, even “spliced by Italians.” The teredo worm is like a science fiction creature, a bivalve with a rasp-edged shell that it uses like a buzz saw to cut through wood – or through submarine cables. Cable companies learned the hard way, early on, that it likes to eat gutta-percha, and subsequent cables received a helical wrapping of copper tape to stop it.  

> There is also the obvious threat of sabotage by a hostile government, but, surprisingly, this almost never happens. When cypherpunk Doug Barnes was researching his Caribbean project, he spent some time looking into this, because it was exactly the kind of threat he was worried about in the case of a data haven. Somewhat to his own surprise and relief, he concluded that it simply wasn’t going to happen. “Cutting a submarine cable,” Barnes says, “is like starting a nuclear war. It’s easy to do, the results are devastating, and as soon as one country does it, all of the others will retaliate.”  

As the capacity of optical fibers climbs, so does the economic damage caused when the cable is severed. FLAG makes its money by selling capacity to long-distance carriers, who turn around and resell it to end users at rates that are increasingly determined by what the market will bear. If FLAG gets chopped, no calls get through. The carriers’ phone calls get routed to FLAG’s competitors (other cables or satellites), and FLAG loses the revenue represented by those calls until the cable is repaired. The amount of revenue it loses is a function of how many calls the cable is physically capable of carrying, how close to capacity the cable is running, and what prices the market will bear for calls on the broken cable segment. In other words, a break between Dubai and Bombay might cost FLAG more in revenue loss than a break between Korea and Japan if calls between Dubai and Bombay cost more.  

The rule of thumb for calculating revenue loss works like this: for every penny per minute that the long distance market will bear on a particular route, the loss of revenue, should FLAG be severed on that route, is about $3,000 a minute. So if calls on that route are a dime a minute, the damage is $30,000 a minute, and if calls are a dollar a minute, the damage is almost a third of a million dollars for every minute the cable is down. Upcoming advances in fiber bandwidth may push this figure, for some cables, past the million-dollar-a-minute mark.  

**Update Feb-06 @ 08:52 GMT:** I am aware of five cable segments that are experiencing problems, including one that was reported on January 23rd which had a repair already underway. I don’t think this is a “fifth cut” as some people are starting to report, and I’ll post an update if that changes.  

A lot of needless confusion and worry could be avoided if FLAG Telecom and the other carriers involved would provide timely and useful updates on their website. It appears that they are doing a good job of restoring connectivity, but they are terrible job of telling an increasingly concerned public exactly what is going on.","The article 'Understanding the undersea cable cuts…' discusses the topic of cut sea cables in detail, covering specific incidents, causes, and the economic and geopolitical implications of such cuts.

It provides concrete examples and calculations of revenue loss due to cable severance, indicating a strong focus on the significance of this issue in telecommunications.

An undersea fibre optic cable connecting Latvia and Sweden was damaged on January 26, 2025.  
The cable, linking the Latvian town of Ventspils with Sweden’s Gotland Island, was damaged in Sweden’s exclusive economic zone at a depth of over 50 meters.  
Latvian Prime Minister Evika Silina described the damage as “significant” and likely caused by external factors.  
After an extraordinary government meeting, she confirmed that Latvia was coordinating with NATO and Baltic Sea nations to clarify the circumstances surrounding the incident.  
Latvia’s navy dispatched a patrol boat to investigate a vessel suspected of involvement, while two more ships in the area were also under investigation.  
One of the vessels, the Malta-flagged bulk carrier Vezhen, was tracked near the damaged cable. MarineTraffic data revealed the Vezhen was closely followed by a Swedish Coast Guard vessel on Sunday evening as both headed toward the southern Swedish coastline.  
While Latvian officials have not confirmed whether the Vezhen is under investigation, the Swedish Coast Guard declined to comment on its involvement, saying it was too early to provide details.  
NATO has joined the investigation, with its ships and aircraft cooperating with Baltic Sea nations to assess the damage and, if necessary, take appropriate action.  
Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson confirmed Sweden’s collaboration with Latvia and NATO, adding that Sweden would deploy its resources to support the investigation.  
In response to growing threats to critical infrastructure in the region following a series of incidents involving damaged undersea cables, pipelines, and power lines, NATO has launched a mission called the “Baltic Sentry.”  
The mission will increase the surveillance of ships in the Baltic Sea with the deployment of more drones, patrol aircraft and warships to protect crucial undersea cables.  
The alliance has reserved the right to take action against any vessels seen as a threat to regional security. The Latvian State Radio and Television Centre (LVRTC), which operates the cable, has begun contracting a vessel to start repairs.  
Although the exact cause of the damage remains unclear, the LVRTC said that it can only be determined once repairs start. Communication providers have already switched to alternative transmission routes to minimise the disruption.  
Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the Baltic Sea has seen several incidents of damaged infrastructure.  
Last month, Finnish police seized a Russian oil tanker suspected of damaging the Finnish-Estonian Estlink 2 power line and four telecom cables by dragging its anchor across the seabed.  
In November 2023, the 745-mile C-Lion1 fibre optic cable connecting Finland to Germany was also damaged, with the authorities of both nations suspecting Russian sabotage.  
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen reiterated the union’s commitment to support the Baltic nations to address these challenges.  
The LVRTC stated that while gas pipelines and power cables can take months to repair, damaged fibre optic cables in the Baltic Sea are typically restored within weeks.  
The Swedish Navy and Coast Guard have also refrained from providing any more details. Spokesperson, Jimmie Adamsson said that it was too early to find out if the damage was intentional or caused by a technical fault.

"Massive Submarine Mudslide Causes SAT-3 and WACS Cable Breaks","Explores the impact of a submarine mudslide on SAT-3 and WACS cables, affecting global telecommunications and digital connectivity.","https://www.oceannews.com/news/subsea-cable/study-points-to-massive-submarine-mudslide-as-cause-of-sat-3-and-wacs-cable-breaks","","Ocean News",Yes,"Ocean News","Stuart, Florida, United States",-,"2023-06-02","English","Ocean News","Cable breaks or faults on subsea optical cables can impact global digital connectivity and have costly ramifications for businesses and internet users. Three such incidents impacted users on the African continent in 2020 alone. Each year more than a hundred cable breaks are recorded across the world causing disruptions to communications and connectivity.

A recent study conducted by Professor Peter J. Talling and a team from the Departments of Earth Sciences and Geography, from the University of Durham in the UK, co-led by Angola Cables and supported by industry members including, the Vodafone Group, British Telecom, NERC Environmental and others, has delivered important findings presenting valuable insights for the routing and protection of future subsea cables.

In January 2020, the South Atlantic 3/West Africa (SAT-3/Wasc) cable, linking Africa to Portugal and Spain was hit by a breakdown in Gabon, whilst the West Africa Cable System (Wacs) that connects South Africa to the United Kingdom saw an outage off the coast of the DRC Congo.

In March, the WACS cable experienced a further break affecting international bandwidth. Whilst many ISPs suffered extended outage periods, most of the major mobile operators were able to mitigate the impact on internet traffic due to their redundancy measures and were in a position to redirect data traffic to other subsea cable networks. Large telcos and mobile operators often employ a divergent strategy to ensure they have alternative routings in place should one of their data carrying cables be affected.

It is estimated that around 1.2 million kilometers of subsea cable carrying power and transmitting data currently transverse continents and geographies across the world. Most of these cables are either buried in the seabed or rest on the ocean floor.

Nearly 75% of the damage caused to these cables are the result of being snagged or damaged by the anchors of ships. Deep see cable faults in water depths of more than 1,000 meters below the sea level, are almost always caused by natural events such as current abrasion, underwater landslides and underwater seismic activity. Often the problem with deep water faults is that they are not as easy to detect and can impact multiple cables – making recovery and repair efforts both lengthy and costly to cable operators.

The cable fault on the SAT-3 was likely caused by an exceptionally large and powerful submarine mud slide that originated at the mouth of the Congo River, just 10 days after the Congo River recorded its largest flood since the 1960s. Sand and mud from the river flood was presumably remobilized, triggering the submarine mud slide that flowed through the offshore Congo Canyon. The canyon is one of the largest underwater canyons on earth, cutting across the continental shelf of West Africa for 85 kilometers until it reaches the shelf edge, then continues down the slope and ends 280 kilometers from its origin. At its deepest point, the V-shaped canyon walls are 1100 meters in height.

These powerful mud slides that damage seabed cables are notoriously difficult to measure in action and are thus poorly understood. The international study undertaken involved the placement of a series of sensors along the canyon, and these sensors that recorded unique information on this type of mud slide. According to observations by Professor Talling and the team, “the data that we recovered from the seabed sensor and mooring data sets within the Congo Canyon have revealed that the undersea mudslide is possibly the longest recorded sediment flow yet measured in action on our planet.”

The evidence gathered provided valuable scientific insights into how major flows are triggered; the frequency, speed and potential impact of mudslides or runout events – the longer the runout the more hazardous these mudslides can be for undersea cables. The other important conclusion was that some cables do not break, but adjacent cables can experience faults by virtue of their location or next to deeply eroded knickpoints.

“Depending on the proximity of cable repair vessels, outages can often take a number of weeks to repair resulting in costly losses to economies impacted by such breaks,” notes Talling, “Gathering evidence and the recorded data in studies such as these are critical to understanding the nature of such subterranean events, and how the subsea cable industry can better provide more durable solutions in keeping the cables – and the world connected.”

The SAT-3 and WACS cable breaks occurred in January and March, 2020 disrupting international network and data traffic. These incidents occurred at a time when many impacted geographies were entering national lockdowns as a result of the global, Covid-19 pandemic. A joint international recovery and repair effort was initiated to restore the faulty cable systems. Post the repair of the cable cuts, efforts were then focused on recovering the sensors and cable mooring data sets.","The article discusses the SAT-3 and WACS cables, detailing how they were affected by submarine mudslides.

For the fourth time in a row, the vessel in question has a visibly damaged port anchor.

The bulker in Sunday's incident, the _Vezhen_, was seized by Sweden on Sunday on suspicion of aggravated sabotage after a cable outage between Gotland and Latvia. Sweden's coast guard quickly intercepted the vessel as soon as the cable breach was identified. The crew opted to divert out of the legal safety of international waters and into Swedish territorial seas, where it was detained; when asked by SVT whether they changed course voluntarily, a senior Swedish prosecutor declined to answer.

_Vezhen_ is operated by Bulgarian shipping company Navigation Maritime Bulgare (Navibulgar) and flagged in Malta. By examining corporate records in Hong Kong, Finnish outlet Helsingin Sanomat determined that the ultimate beneficial owner is ICBC Leasing, a financier owned by the Chinese state.

Navibulgar CEO Alexander Kalchev told SVT that the anchor came loose in heavy weather, and that it was an accident. ""This is something that needs to be proven,"" he said.

"Challenges in Repairing Vietnam's Internet Cables","Five cable breaks in 2017 due to weather and marine traffic; repairs delayed by regulatory red tape, impacting internet connectivity.","https://saigoneer.com/saigon-technology/11885-sharks,-anchors-red-tape-why-it-takes-forever-to-fix-vietnam-s-broken-internet-cables","","Saigoneer in Tech 9 YEARS AGO",Yes,"Saigoneer in Tech","Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",-,-,"English","Saigoneer","Are the sharks all to blame, or should other aquatic creatures also be held responsible for Vietnam’s sluggish internet?

Vietnam is no stranger to submarine internet cable breakages: this year alone, the country’s cables at the bottom of the East Sea have broken five times, in January, February, August, October and November. The most recent issue still hasn’t been resolved, and internet service providers (ISPs) are unsure when local connections will return to normal.

In a recent series on Vietnam’s 20-year journey with the internet, Tuoi Tre looked into the obscure process behind how local ISPs carry out maintenance and repairs on submarine cables. For technicians from the country’s largest ISPs, breakages have lost the surprise element as they’re now “used to all the problems” and have put in place backup procedures in case of an outage.

Much of Vietnam’s data goes through three major undersea fiber optic cables to reach the global network: the Asia-America Gateway (AAG), the Intra-Asia cable (IA) and the Asia-Pacific Gateway (APG). The first two were installed in 2009 while the APG became operational starting in 2016.

By the end of 2016, the country’s international bandwidth speed had reached 3.8 terabytes per second – 38 times faster than before the AAG was installed.

General Director of FPT Telecom Nguyen Van Khoa told Tuoi Tre that there are many reasons behind the numerous breakages of the undersea cable network, including weather, marine traffic and seismic activity.

According to experts, the stretch of ocean between Vietnam and Singapore is home to busy shipping routes frequently utilized by heavy freighters and fishing boats. Thus the cables have to endure anchors being dropped and dragged over them on a daily basis.

Vietnam’s coastal area is also prone to tropical storms, such as the recent Damrey and Kirogi, which can wreak havoc on the cable network.

Of course, at times, these internet outages can also be caused by human factors. In 2007, the Thailand-Vietnam-Hong Kong (TVH) cable malfunctioned, rendering much of Vietnam’s network sluggish for months. The cause: a gang of local pirates stole 98 kilometers of cables and a repeater to resell as ve chai. The repair cost US$1.3 million, a quarter of which came out of VNPT’s pocket. The thieves were also sentenced to 12 years in prison for the heist.

In other cases, the control station in the impacted locality will identify the cut’s location and inform the system operators, who will order a cable repair vessel to book a repair date. Each of these stages usually takes one day.

Depending on which country the cable break is nearest, the repair ship and cable operator will then send a document to its government seeking access to carry out repairs. Getting permission often takes a week, while traveling to the location can take the vessel from three to four days.

The actual repair work is a collaborative effort between divers and submersible robots. The former stabilizes the rupture while a the latter grabs the two broken ends and moves them to the surface to be welded back together. This usually takes three to four days. The submersible will then return the cable to its original location and bury it.

This entire process ranges from three weeks to a month, depending on the severity of the rupture and weather conditions.

It has become something of a running gag in Vietnam that curious sharks are behind these internet “attacks,” however, there has never been any concrete evidence proving this conjecture. Nonetheless, tech giant Google seems to buy into the theory: in 2014, a product manager from the firm revealed that his company was taking measures – such as covering the fiber with a Kevlar-like material – to protect cables from sharks.

Frequent breakages are not a problem unique to Asia-Pacific, the new sources claims, noting that cables in the Atlantic Ocean also require some 50 repairs annually due to an array of reasons, including fishing trawlers to anchors and earthquakes.","The article titled ""Sharks, Anchors & Red Tape: Why It Takes Forever to Fix Vietnam's Broken Internet Cables"" discusses the issue of undersea internet cable breakages in Vietnam extensively.

It mentions that Vietnam's submarine internet cables have broken multiple times within a year, specifically five times in 2017 alone, and provides specific details about the causes of these breakages, which include weather, marine traffic, and even human actions such as theft.

The article explains the impact of these cable cuts on internet connectivity and the lengthy repair process, which can take weeks due to regulatory permissions and logistical challenges.

It also humorously addresses the myth that sharks are responsible for the cable damage, while noting that there is no concrete evidence to support this claim.

Undersea cables were first laid in the 1850s between Britain and Europe and between Britain and US-Canada. Cables have been broken by human (fishing trawlers, poor leaky cable insulation material and anchors) and natural (earthquakes, currents, bitey sharks and whales) activity. A number of ports, such as Halifax, Canada, near important cable routes became homes to specialised cable repair ships.

Jonathan Reed Winkler writing in [_War on the Rocks_ records](http://warontherocks.com/2015/11/silencing-the-enemy-cable-cutting-in-the-spanish-american-war/) that during the Spanish - American War (1898) US naval ships cut undersea cables to isolate the major Spanish possessions of the Philippines, Puerto Rico and Cuba. Spanish ground and naval forces were thus prevented from having rapid communications with the high command in Spain.

Surface ships have been more commonly used to cut undersea cables. In World War One, the British General Post Office Cable Ship [CS _Alert_](http://strowger-net.telefoniemuseum.nl/tel_hist_alert.html) was used to locate and cut five German cables heading into the Atlantic. A similar operation cut the German cables that connected Great Britain to the German coast. Successive missions by the CS _Telconia_ and other ships later in the war eliminated the remainder of Germany's cable network and, in some instances, pulled the cables up with their grapples and relaid them into British and French ports for use by the Allied powers instead.

This [useful book link](https://books.google.com/books?id=rCWMBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA1323&lpg=PA1323&dq=u-151+cut+undersea+cables&source=bl&ots=ATSPufKYdt&sig=ZKCz-Y40aGgvPF8VDEZ5CaAceB0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMImNvEvuLjyAIVhCmICh0mnQU0#v=onepage&q=u-151%20cut%20undersea%20cables&f=false) indicates submarines, very early on, were also active in cable cutting. ""The **U-151** [in 1918] also cut the undersea cables between New York and Nova Scotia and New York and Colon, Panama.""

At the beginning of World War Two Atlantic cables would have been cut in 1939, mainly by surface ships. In the Pacific the Japanese advance was so fast that allied cable cutting sometimes took until 1945.

Since 1945 cables continue to be broken by fishing trawlers, anchors, earthquakes, currents, and bitey sharks. In response to this threat to the communications network, the practice of cable burial has developed. Still, cable breaks are by no means a thing of the past, with more than 50 repairs a year in the Atlantic alone, and significant breaks in 2006, 2008, and 2009.

The risk of fishing trawler nets causing cable faults was exploited during the Cold War. For example, in February 1959, a series of 12 breaks occurred in five American trans-Atlantic communications cables. In response, a United States naval vessel, the [U.S.S. _Roy O. Hale_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Roy_O._Hale_\(DE-336\)), detained and investigated the **Russian** trawler _Novorosiysk_. A review of _Novorosiysk's_ log indicated it had been in the region of each of the cables when they broke. Broken sections of cable were also found on the deck of the _Novorosiysk_. It appeared that the cables had been dragged along by the ship's nets, and then cut once they were pulled up onto the deck to release the nets. The Russian stance on the investigation was that detaining _Novorosiysk_ was unjustified, but the United States cited the [Convention for the Protection of Submarine Telegraph Cables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Submarine_Telegraph_Cables) of 1884 to which Russia had signed as evidence of violation of international law.

**Thus the Russians do have a record of cutting cables but they do not need dark ominous $Billion dollar submarines or UUVs to do it – just small cable ships or even trawlers.**

Cable Landing Stations can locate a break in a cable in less than a second. This is using electronic monitors and measurements, such as through [spread-spectrum time-domain reflectometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread-spectrum_time-domain_reflectometry) (SSTDR).

**In a major war cable cutting has three main advantages:**  
1. It immediately disrupts an enemy's international communications.  
2. It also immediately disrupts domestic communications because, in the digital age, much of the internet AND telecommunications between major cities of the same country rely on international servers and links.  
3. Having lost international cables an enemy is forced to use satellites, microwave links and other radio links. Since the beginning of World War One cables have been cut, in part, because subsequent reliance on radio links is much more easy to intercept.

These are the main internet cables which connect South Africa to Europe run along the west coast of Africa, including the West Africa Cable System (Wacs) and Google’s Equiano cable.

Microsoft named the four cables affected as Wacs, MainOne, Sat-3 and Ace. Local reports say the breaks could take weeks or even months to fix.

Vodacom, a major telco in the region, admitted that all of South Africa’s network providers were affected.

Not helping is that East Africa’s major ‘Seacom’ cable in the Red Sea was also severed, probably by a ship’s anchor. Seacom said in February that data traffic was interrupted on its cable which runs from Mombasa in Kenya to Zafarana in Egypt.

By Captain Don Walsh, U.S. Navy (Retired)  

In 2023, there are 552 major seafloor cables in the world with a total length of 850,000 miles. Reliable and cost-effective, they carry more than 95 percent of international data transmissions. Daily, they move financial transactions valued at $10 trillion. Mostly owned by private companies, they are critical elements in the worldwide communications infrastructure. By contrast, satellites carry only 3 percent of global traffic.

There are other cable networks that transmit electrical energy over more moderate distances. An example is the four lines between the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, and Ireland power grids. Bidirectional, they help keep power demands in balance to accommodate both sides of the English Channel. The longest in the world, completed in 2022, is the 450-mile North Sea Link—a 1,400 MW cable between the UK and Norway.

In recent years, offshore wind farms have become a major installer of seafloor electrical cables delivering energy from wind turbines to onshore.

NOAA

How vulnerable are seafloor cables to disruption? Ruggedly designed and constructed for unattended operations in a hostile environment, they still are subject to damage. Natural tectonic events such as volcanic eruptions, movements of the seafloor, and underwater landslides have severed cables. Humans have damaged cables through ship anchor entanglements, seafloor trawling by fishing vessels, and dredging operations. Almost all outages today are accidents, so owners tend to publicize the mapped locations of their seafloor cables so maritime operations can stay clear of those areas.

Underwater military capabilities have demonstrated the ability to cut cables covertly on the seafloor. On land, maximum damage is most likely at places where more than one cable converge ashore. Some onshore locations are in relatively remote and unpopulated areas. Their destruction would be hard to prevent.

In short, seafloor cable systems are hard to defend and easy to put out of service. So, what can be done to protect them? Some thoughts are to aggressively monitor convergence cable termination sites on shore, increase existing redundancy by adding more cables but dispersing their onshore landing sites, and, in an emergency, develop means to quickly parallel vital communications to satellites and conventional radio transmissions. None of these solutions is ideal, but in sum they could guarantee a level of international communication activity can be maintained.

**Seafloor Pipelines**

Today, there are 20,000 miles of pipelines worldwide. Most of them carry petroleum products such as natural gas and crude oil.

In the Gulf of Mexico alone there are at least 8,000 miles of active seafloor pipelines. For more than 80 years pipelines have transported crude oil and natural gas to shore. Surprisingly, the locations of some pipelines are only approximately known. Many are no longer in use, and 97 percent of those have been left in place. Abandoned lines are estimated to add up to 18,000 miles.

How vulnerable are seafloor pipelines to disruption? Like seafloor cables, seafloor pipelines form a fragile network that can be easily damaged. They also are subject to similar natural and man-made damages. But unlike cables, breaching one or more pipelines would not have a major impact in a national emergency. Environmental impacts could be great, but the international energy network could work around the temporary loss of offshore oil and gas.

A test of the loss occurred in September 2022. The Russian-owned Nord Stream 1 and 2 natural gas pipelines in the Baltic were sabotaged by an explosion of uncertain origin and ruptured in several places.

The Nord Stream project was politically unpopular, as it was seen by many as a Russian move to make Europe more dependent on its supply of natural gas. After the Ukraine war began, Russia occasionally reduced flow and briefly shut the line in response to economic sanctions. Some believe Russia may have sabotaged its own lines to shut down a significant (40 percent) source of Europe’s natural gas supplies. Repair options are being studied, and it is estimated the work could take up to a decade.","The article titled 'Seafloor Cables and Pipelines: Are They Secure?' discusses the vulnerabilities of seafloor cables, including the potential for them to be cut by underwater military capabilities.

"Repair of Damaged Subsea Cables in the Red Sea","Three major subsea cables repaired after being severed, impacting telecommunications traffic and internet connectivity in the region.","https://gcaptain.com/damaged-subsea-cables-repaired-in-red-sea","","Bloomberg",Yes,-,"Morro Bay, California, US","5000","2024-07-17","English","Bloomberg","By Olivia Solon and Mohammed Hatem (Bloomberg) —

Repairs have finally commenced on three subsea telecommunications cables that were damaged in the Red Sea in February, even as Houthi militants escalate their attacks on ships in the area.

The AAE-1 cable, a 25,000-kilometer (15,500 miles) fiber optic link between Asia and Europe, was repaired by a ship owned by E-Marine, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi-based Emirates Telecommunications Group. The cable came online this week, a Yemeni government official said. The same ship, Niwa, remains in Yemeni waters to repair the remaining two cables, Seacom and EIG.

The cables, among more than a dozen that run through the Red Sea, were severed by the anchor of a cargo ship sunk by Iran-backed Houthi militants in late February.

Repairs to the cables have depended on gaining access to infrastructure in Yemen’s waters, a task complicated by the country’s split government and the fact the Red Sea is a conflict zone. It has taken months of negotiations involving the cable operators and the two factions that control Yemen — the internationally-recognized government in the south and the Houthi-backed government in Sanaa — to arrange for the repair mission.

“These are some of the biggest data highways connecting Europe, Middle East, India and Asia,” said Roderick Beck, a consultant who sources network capacity on subsea cables for telecommunications clients. “The downtime has forced carriers to completely reroute traffic by building new digital highways stitched together using new cables at considerable expense and working around the clock.”

Although the telecommunications data that passes along the damaged cables was re-routed, the incident highlighted the vulnerability of critical subsea infrastructure and the challenges of making repairs in the Red Sea, one of the world’s most important shipping lanes and a conflict zone since late 2023. Houthi militants, an Islamist group claiming to support Hamas, have recently ramped up attacks on vessels in the area, including using a drone boat packed with explosives to sink a coal ship, Bloomberg News reported in June.

The consortium operating the AAE-1 cable, which includes Emirates Telecommunications Group, Telecom Egypt and Saudi Arabia’s Mobily, had initially struggled to get a permit from the internationally-recognized Yemeni government because of a dispute over one of the consortium’s members, TeleYemen. The government approved permits for the other two cables in May, but refused AAE-1 and launched a criminal investigation into TeleYemen’s alleged ties to the Houthi militia.

It’s not clear how the AAE-1 cable consortium was able to obtain a permit. A government representative declined to comment further. Representatives for the consortium did not respond to requests for comment. Representatives for Seacom and EIG did not respond to requests for comment.

The Houthis have been attacking merchant and military ships in the southern Red Sea since mid-November. The strikes have forced many cargo vessels to sail around southern Africa instead of through the Red Sea and Suez Canal — sending freight rates soaring and raising concerns about the security of underwater cables that help transmit data across the world.

Without these cables, many aspects of modern society would grind to a halt. Not least the economy — about $10 trillion in transactions are transmitted through these undersea cables daily, per the US Naval Institute.

TeleGeography, a telecoms research company, notes that there are over 100 cable breaks yearly.

According to UltramapGlobal, a company that monitors subsea cables, natural hazards like the one in Tonga account for about 14% of cable faults.

However, around 70% of all cable faults—the vast majority—are caused by man-made damage, primarily by dragging anchors and deep-sea fishing, it estimated.

UltramapGlobal said more than a third of the damage comes from fishing, with trawling and fixed nets often damaging the cables.

In addition to trawlers, UltramapGlobal said about 25% of damage is caused by ships dragging their anchors.

Sabotage by hostile actors is exceedingly rare, according to TeleGeography.

That's not to say, however, that it isn't a cause for concern. Intentional damage can have far-reaching consequences. And sneakier adversaries could also siphon data from the cables without breaking them.

According to the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence's 2022 annual threat assessment paper, Russia is particularly focused on improving its ability to target critical infrastructure, including underwater cables.

The Wall Street Journal reported in May that US officials privately warned tech companies, including Google and Meta, about the threat of Chinese ships spying using undersea cables in the Pacific region.

In response to these threats, NATO established a center last year dedicated to protecting undersea cables and pipelines.

Nevertheless, for now, the biggest threat to these vital cables remains unsuspecting trawlers.","The article titled ""Undersea internet cables more at risk from accidents than sabotage"" discusses the vulnerabilities of undersea cables, noting that human activities, particularly fishing and anchoring, are the primary causes of cable faults.

It cites specific incidents, such as the Tonga underwater eruption, which severed internet connections, demonstrating the implications of such occurrences on internet connectivity and local economies.

The article states that around 70% of cable faults are caused by man-made damage, primarily from fishing and dragging anchors, which aligns with the criterion of discussing cut sea cables.

Therefore, the article treats the topic of cut sea cables as a central theme rather than a minor mention."

US President Joe Biden warned this week that Russia is considering attacks on critical infrastructure. One of the scenarios that has been mooted since the start of the war in Ukraine is that Moscow will attack undersea cables to cut off the Western world's internet.  

""Based on evolving intelligence, [Russia](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/russia/) might be planning a cyber attack against us,” [Biden](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/joe-biden/) said at a press conference on March 21. ""The magnitude of Russia's cyber capacity is fairly consequential and it's coming.""  

It was not the first time since the start of Russia's invasion of [Ukraine](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/ukraine/) that the US president has issued this warning. The day after the launch of the Russian invasion on February 24, Washington announced it was ""prepared"" to ward off any Russian cyber attacks.  

Biden urged American companies to ""lock their digital doors"" as quickly as possible to protect themselves. The fear is that ""unprecedented cost inflicted on Russia"" by all the latest international sanctions could push [Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/vladimir-putin/) to retaliate by directly attacking [NATO](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/nato/) countries using cyber weapons, Biden said.  

Moscow was quick to categorically reject these accusations. ""The Russian Federation, unlike many Western countries including the United States, does not engage in state-level banditry,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday.  

**Underwater cables at risk**  

But Biden's warnings have nonetheless revived the spectre of a digital disaster scenario in which Russia could deprive much of the world of internet access by attacking undersea cables.  

This prospect has been raised more than once, even in high military circles, since the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis. Admiral Tony Radakin, head of the British armed forces, said in January that Moscow could ""put at risk and potentially exploit the world’s real information system, which is undersea cables that go all around the world”, according to [the Guardian newspaper](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/08/uk-military-chief-warns-of-russian-threat-to-vital-undersea-cables). Radakin’s theory was shared by the influential American think tank Atlantic Council, which [published an article](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/cord-cutting-russian-style-could-the-kremlin-sever-global-internet-cables/?utm_source=pocket_mylist) on the risk of the Kremlin severing global internet cables at the beginning of the year.  

In excess of 430 undersea internet cables represent tempting targets for anyone wishing to disrupt global connectivity. Often seen as one of the weakest links in the global network, these cables ""look like large garden hoses lying at the bottom of the sea"", Tobias Liebetrau, an expert on international relations and IT security issues at the Danish Institute for International Studies, told FRANCE 24.  

Moreover, they have no special protection, except for ""integrated surveillance systems that can send out alerts only if there is a threat nearby"", added Liebetrau.  

**Easily concealed attacks**  

""It is theoretically very easy to conceal the sabotage of an undersea cable,"" said Christian Bueger, a specialist in maritime security issues at the University of Copenhagen.  

All it would take to damage a cable would be for a merchant ship or fishing boat to drop its anchor on one not far from the coast, where these infrastructures are at a reasonably shallow level. Divers or submarines could also place explosives on the cables or install mines nearby, which could then be detonated remotely.  

The results could be potentially spectacular and very costly for Western economies. As soon as a European internet user logs into their Gmail inbox, writes a tweet or ""likes"" a school friend's Facebook post, their requests cross the Atlantic via a network of these undersea cables.  

""They are vital if you are trying to transfer data to countries overseas,"" said Emile Aben, a computer security specialist at the RIPE Network Coordination Centre, an NGO that serves as a regional IP address registry for Europe and the Middle East, speaking with FRANCE 24.  

If the hypothesis of a Russian attack against these infrastructures is worrying, it is because “Russia has been spotted doing naval research or exercises close to places where the cables are located"", said Bueger. Russian ships have carried out exercises near Ireland and Norway, where several submarine cables run linking Europe to the United States. Russian research boats were also spotted in 2014 off the coast of Portugal, again in an area where there are a dozen submarine cables. For years, there has been a suspicion that ""Russia is up to something"", noted Bueger.  

**An act of war**  

Bueger explained there is also ""the impression that during each conflict, the means of communication are always among the priority targets. During the Second World War, it was the telegraphs, and today it would be the undersea cables”.  

But depriving the world of internet is not as straightforward as cutting electric wires on the front line in 1939.  

""Attacking one internet cable is a bit like destroying a single lane on a ten-lane highway. If the highway has enough capacity, traffic won't notice,"" said Aben. Highly connected countries, such as most European states, the United States or Asian countries, rely on much more than one cable to link them to the world, precisely because these infrastructures are so vulnerable.  

""Apart from a few isolated islands, there are very few countries that would be deprived of the internet if only two or three cables were damaged,"" said Liebetrau. The islands that would be affected include the Azores archipelago, the island of Madeira and the Australian state of Tasmania.  

""Russia would have to mount a large-scale military operation to really threaten internet access for targets like the United States or Europe,"" said Liebetrau. “They would need to do a lot of reconnaissance operations to find out exactly where each cable is located, because although maps exist, they are deliberately not very precise.""  

Russia would then have to mobilise a large number of ships and submarines to strike all the targeted cables simultaneously. ""One place to target would be the Suez canal because it's a choke point for data transfer between Europe and Asia. But you would need to use explosives,"" said Bueger.  

Moreover, this kind of action would mainly target the civilian population. ""While there is no alternative to undersea cables for everyday internet use (managing financial flows, watching movies, playing video games), some less data-intensive communications, such as military or government-to-government communications, could still be handled by satellite networks,"" said Bueger.  

This is why, even if in theory undersea cables appear to be prime targets, ""it's highly unlikely that Russia would go down this route"", assured Liebetrau. An attack of this level would be considered an act of war by the West, Radakin confirmed. And Moscow would probably not be willing to escalate such an operation, which would require a lot of resources without having any significant impact on NATO's military capabilities.  

It is possible, however, that Russia could launch some lesser attack, just to prove its power. ""I can see them going after one or two cables as a symbolic gesture,” said Bueger.

An unseen threat is lurking beneath the surface. The suspected Houthi attacks on undersea cables in the Red Sea are a timely reminder of a new reality. The age of seabed warfare, where undersea infrastructure will increasingly be targeted, has arrived.  

Predicting the future is always tricky, yet the direction here is clear. Recent situations in the Baltic, North Sea, Black Sea and now the Red Sea point to a change in way wars, and hybrid warfare, will be fought. Attacks on undersea infrastructure will likely become more common, even expected.  

A victim of future wars might be your internet connection when a cable is cut. Or your heating bill as a gas pipeline or electricity cable is blown up. And these events might take place thousands of miles away, and hundreds of meters below sea level. These new threats are not well understood.  

It is tempting to point to historic incidents of seabed warfare. When Britain cut the German undersea telegraph cables at the outbreak of World War One. Or the U.S. Navy’s famous Operation Ivy Bells to tap Soviet undersea cables in the Cold War. But a lot has changed since then which has transformed this threat.  

The world is ever more connected. Power, natural gas, oil, and of course the internet all rely on undersea infrastructure. And data centers and nuclear power plants could go the same way. Thanks to this connectivity, it is conceivable that an attack on an offshore wind farm in Sweden could be felt in electricity bills in Ireland. These are all susceptible to attack. Governments are only slowly coming to terms with this new dimension to naval warfare.  

**The Seabed Is Ripe For Hybrid Warfare**  

The inherent ambiguity and indirect nature makes undersea infrastructure tempting targets for hybrid warfare. In the absence of a clear culprit, and slow process of attribution (if any), allows activists and cynical politicians to fill the void with misinformation. Many are only too willing to believe conspiracy theories and irresponsible speculation.  

Attacks can also be relatively unsophisticated. It can be by divers in shallow water, or by a ship dragging an anchor or fishing net. Even if the culprit is known, it can be difficult to prove that it was deliberate.  

As well as sophisticated navies, small countries and non-state actors can leverage this. As is suspected in the Red Sea. Or the many incidents off West Africa. Hamas built uncrewed underwater vehicles (UUVs) to target Israeli offshore natural gas infrastructure. That has yet to score a hit, but the threat is real.  

**Seabed Warfare As part of Future Hot Wars**  

It is now realistic that attacks on seabed infrastructure will be common in hot wars. It seems inconceivable that a Chinese attack on Taiwan wouldn’t involve at least threat of seabed warfare. The island is connected to America and the world by a finite number of undersea internet cables. Severing these would in effect disconnect the island, making defense and coordination much harder.  

Historically, and right now, Russia is the most invested in offensive seabed warfare capabilities. It has a fleet of nuclear submarines designed to carry smaller nuclear submarines which can interfere with seabed infrastructure deep below the surface. This is complemented by specialist ships, most famously Yantar, and many other assets.  

But it doesn’t necessarily require these traditional specialist assets. The increasing maturity of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) may shape those threats going forward. An AUV could be launched from hundreds or even thousands of miles away, approach its target unseen, and blow it up. It could locate the cable or pipe using sonar or any of a multitude of methods open to engineers and planners. And it could deposit a bomb, in the manner used for neutralizing mines, or simply blow itself up.  

Attacking seabed targets will never be easy. It is inherently more challenging than attacking above ground infrastructure. So it will require high quality intelligence and careful planning. But the technical means to achieve it is well within reach for most navies. And an increasing number of AUV manufacturers have the requisite knowhow to build suitable vehicles.

Johannesburg, 28 Mar 2020

The West Africa Cable System (WACS) submarine cable has suffered another break.

This was revealed by the South African National Research & Education Network (SA NREN), a major user of the cable, which detected the break just before midnight.

In a series of tweets, the organisation said: “We are observing our WACS capacity as down since 23h28 UTC/27th March 2020. A call has been logged with our provider for feedback. Traffic has failed over to SEACOM and EASSy cable systems…

It added: “With the WACS and continued SAT-3 outages on the East Coast, SA NREN users working from home during the #Covid19SA #LockdownSA may experience issues if their home providers do not have sufficient capacity via alternate sub-sea cable systems.”

SA NREN says the WACS outage due to a suspected cable fault between Highbridge London and Seixal Portugal, and tests currently being conducted.

WACS is a submarine communications cable linking SA with the UK along the west coast of Africa that was constructed by Alcatel-Lucent.

The cable consists of four fibre pairs and is 14 530km in length, linking from Yzerfontein in the Western Cape of SA to London in the UK.

In January, WACS also suffered a cable break together with the SAT3/WASC cable, resulting in slow Internet speeds in SA.

Local Internet service providers (ISPs) have already started feeling the impact of the WACS cable break.

In a tweet this morning ISP Afrohost said: “Two of the undersea cables (WACS and SAT3) have suffered breaks. We’re working together with our suppliers to secure an alternate international path ASAP. We understand that you need your Internet now more than ever. This is our top priority. Thanks for your patience.”

Webafrica says: “We are currently experiencing slow speeds due to WACS undersea cable breaks. We are busy attending to the issue and will keep you updated on our Network Status page.”

Says Telkom: “Good day, please note that due to pre-existing outage on the West Africa Submarine Cable System (WACS), you may experience slow Internet response when browsing international websites. Our team of technicians are investigating this and will provide feedback soon.”

Subsea cables hit the headlines earlier this year after four out of 15 critical submarine cables in the Red Sea were cut amid attacks by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels on Israeli, U.S., and U.K. ships.

Public awareness of submarine cables has grown as a result — and these networks of cables are becoming a new source of strain in international relations, amid heating geopolitical engagements between the U.S. and China.

Buried deep underwater are hundreds of massive telecommunications cables spanning a length of nearly 1.4 million kilometers, according to the telecom market research firm TeleGeometry.

It’s Fun Fact Friday and today we’re going to talk about repairing submarine cables. Submarine data cables are located under the ocean, and connect people around the world with data and information, while submarine electrical cables transfer electricity, such as those used on wind farms. Undersea cables for data transmission have been around since the mid-1800s, and you can learn more about the history of data cables and how they send information all around the globe in our article [How do undersea data cables work?](https://www.onesteppower.com/post/how-do-undersea-data-cables-work) Today, we’re going to look at how underwater cables can break, how they are repaired, protection methods, and the differences in the two types of cables.  

**Differences in the two types of cables**  
Data cables are made up of a small number of fiber optic strands of glass about the width of a human hair. Most of the cable is actually protection for these strands, as well as conductive material to power the cables. The size of the final product varies depending on the amount of protection it needs: larger, more protected cables are usually near the shore in shallow water, and thinner cables are buried deep under the ocean. Repeaters are included every 40-80 km to keep the signal strong. Submarine power cables vary from about 70mm to over 210mm and can be either AC or DC. According to European Subsea Cables Association, “The selection criteria for which type of cable to use is heavily dependent on the route length, voltage, transmission capacity and Grid synchronisation.” AC cables is usually used for 80km and shorter, while longer distances require DC cables and higher voltages. AC cables are 3 core in a bundle or laid as separate cables. Depending on the system, DC cables are mono-polar or bi-polar with the two conductors laid separately or as one.  

**Why do underwater cables need repair?**  
Damage can be caused by failure in a cable, but this is very uncommon. Earthquakes can damage cables, like the one in 2006 off the coast of Taiwan that caused a loss in international phone and internet data service. Sharks sometimes chew on the cables, as seen in the article above, but this is also rare and they usually don’t do much damage. The most common failure is boats; trawling by fishing boats and ships dropping anchor can snag and easily damage the cables, which aren’t buried very deeply in the sea bed.  

**How are underwater cables repaired?**  
Some of these cables span the ocean to connect continents, and can sometimes be located farther below the surface of the ocean than Mount Everest is tall, making repairs time consuming. The first step in repairing an underwater cable that can be thousands of miles long is figuring out where the damage is located. The general location is found by internet and phone outages, or in the case of electrical cable, the power outage. Data cables are fiber optic, so a light pulse is sent through the cable that would normally go all the way to the other side. Broken fibers bounce the light pulse back, and engineers can measure the time it takes the pulse to return to find the specific location of the break. Undersea power cables get a rough estimate of where the break is, then send a Remotely Operated Vehicle, or ROV, with fault detection instruments to find the damage. Some causes, like an anchor strike, may be easy to see, but others take more time to find. Once the break is located, a cable ship is dispatched to repair. All they have to do is brave the weather, pirates, and sea creatures for a successful fix. To stay on station during repairs, [cable lay and repair vessels](https://www.onesteppower.com/post/cable-lay-vessels) are fitted with [dynamic positioning systems](https://www.onesteppower.com/post/what-is-dynamic-positioning). These systems keep vessels in a specific location during winds, waves, and even storms, and are essential to the repair process.  

Cable ships are loaded with enough cable for repairs, maybe 5-10 km, which can be loaded in a few hours. Fun fact: this is just a fraction of the cable capacity of some of the newer ships like Orange Marine's _Le Pierre de Fermat_, which can hold 9,000 km of cable and take weeks to load. Cables are at the highest risk of damage during the loading and installing process. Cable ships have systems that can send power through the cable to make sure it is tested before install. Breaks are not uncommon, according to WIRED: “The breaks happen surprisingly frequently. ‘There's a cable fault somewhere in the world twice a week,’ Tim Stronge, vice president of Telegeography, which creates giant undersea cable maps.” Crews have to be vigilant, as these vessels are sometimes attacked by pirates who steal parts of the cables that connect them to land. Most cable breaks aren’t big news because there are so many cables that data can be rerouted fairly easily. Wind farms could be in greater danger due a lack of redundancy in the main power cables that deliver the electricity to shore. There have been large outages, such as in 2008 when Egypt lost 70% of its nationwide internet network and India had disruptions in 60% of theirs.  

If the damaged cable is in shallow water, an ROV equipped with cameras and robotic claws is deployed to find the fault and retrieve the cable. Sometimes, the cable is hard to find due to displacement, such as being dragged off course by a fishing vessel. The ROVs can’t operate in deep water due to the increased pressure, so to fix a deep water cable, the ship has to use a grapnel, which grabs and cuts the cable, dragging the two loose ends to the surface. If needed, one end can then be hooked to a buoy and the other end brought on board. Cable has to be added to make the repair, since there is not enough slack to bring the cable up and cut a piece out. After the cable is retrieved and on board, in a repair room that looks like a laboratory, engineers repair the cable. Data cables can take up to 16 hours to repair, after which they are lowered back down to the sea bed in an omega or hairpin pattern to accommodate the extra length. There is new technology in development that would make in situ repair possible for power cables, preventing the need to pull the cables up to the surface.  

**How do we protect undersea cables?**  
Cables can be protected from shark bites with metal sheathing or a metal tube. For fishing vessels, maps are freely provided to fishermen in the hopes that they do not fish over such cables. But, the cables themselves aren’t what’s valuable, especially with data cables, the information that flows through them is the most valuable part. How do we protect the data within the cables? Countries take steps to prevent certain companies from controlling too much data, but there are 750,000 miles of undersea data cables around the world, without which people wouldn’t be able to function. According to Defense News, “In 1858, when the first submarine cable was installed, sending a message across the Atlantic took nearly 18 hours. Today, the fastest undersea cables can transfer data at speeds upward of 25 terabytes per second — more than twice the amount of data generated by the Hubble Space Telescope each year.” These cables transmit about 95% of voice and data traffic for civilians and governments. Cables can be tapped for information, or cut to drastically slow communication between countries. A greater emphasis on government protection of the cables may be in the future.

Earlier this week, operators of two communications cables—[C-Lion 1 and BCS East-West Interlink](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/multiselect/submarine-cable?ids=bcs-east-west-interlink,c-lion1)—reported faults in the Baltic Sea.  
Local internet service seems [largely](https://blog.cloudflare.com/resilient-internet-connectivity-baltic-cable-cuts/) [unaffected](https://labs.ripe.net/author/emileaben/does-the-internet-route-around-damage-baltic-sea-cable-cuts/), but a swirl of sabotage allegations have emerged in the global press.  
Without making a ruling on any ongoing investigations, let’s look at the facts.  
### How unusual are cable breaks?  
Submarine cables break all the time. On average, two to four break somewhere in the world _every week_.  
While damage is more common in some areas than others, these breaks—or “faults”—eventually happen to almost every cable.  
### If cables go out of service so often, why don’t I hear about it?  
Most of the time, cable faults only make the news if multiple systems go offline or damage occurs in geopolitical hotspots. Simultaneous breaks are more likely to affect service quality, and some islands may lose their undersea connectivity altogether (like in the [Shetland](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-63326102) and [Matsu Islands](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/fishing-cargo-boats-blamed-for-two-taiwan-submarine-cable-cuts/)).  
You rarely hear about other cable faults because most telecom providers follow a “safety in numbers” approach.  
> By spreading their networks' capacity over multiple cables, operators ensure that if one breaks, their network will run smoothly over the others until the damage is repaired.  
To minimize downtime, cable owners also hold standing agreements with maintenance providers that keep ships on standby, waiting to deploy spares of extra cable length and make needed repairs quickly.[](https://blog.telegeography.com/what-is-submarine-cable-redundancy)  
### What causes cables to break?  
Most faults are caused by “external aggression.”  
That sounds scary! But this term only means that a cable didn't suffer a technical fault on its own, and was instead damaged by external forces. Most come from fishing equipment, normal anchoring activity, and natural disasters like undersea earthquakes. Internal component or equipment failure causes another, smaller category of faults.  
(In case you’re wondering, no cable faults have been attributed to shark bites [since 2007](https://www.iscpc.org/documents/?id=1959).)  
Although multiple cables breaking at the same time feels improbable, it’s more likely than you may think.  
In some locations, geological or regulatory constraints herd cables into narrow corridors, greatly increasing the risk of simultaneous cuts across multiple cables. Across larger distances, multiple breaks can happen through simple bad luck.  
### Are cables ever damaged on purpose?  
State-sponsored sabotage is extremely rare, and most publicly known examples are decades old (for example, in World War I or the Spanish-American War).  
However, routine cable faults can resemble sabotage if operators or governments aren’t certain of what caused them. After all, deniability is a key element of modern “gray zone” attack vectors.  
While less exciting, some fishermen may [cut a cable on purpose](https://www.iscpc.org/documents/?id=308). This can happen if their gear snags on a cable and they are able to bring it to the surface. To discourage this, cable operators often offer to pay for lost equipment if fishermen sacrifice their gear instead of tampering with the cable.  
### How do we know what happened to a cable?  
[In cases like Tonga’s](https://blog.telegeography.com/podcast-submarine-cables-earthquakes-volcanoes), where a volcanic explosion famously disrupted the island nation's only subsea connectivity, it’s easy to conclude that environmental damage caused a break.  
In other instances, determining the cause of a break takes time. Maintenance crews often set sail knowing where damage occurred—but not what caused it. Once on-site, initial hypotheses can be confirmed or denied based on how the cable looks.  
One tool cable operators can use to determine the possible cause of damage from afar is Automatic Identification System (AIS) data.  
Ships use AIS to transmit their location back to shore or to other nearby vessels. This helps ensure safe navigation and is required for some ships under international law. If a ship crosses a cable at the same place and time that it breaks, that ship may have caused the damage (accidentally or otherwise).  
### So if AIS shows a foreign ship crossing a cable, that’s evidence of sabotage?  
When AIS shows a vessel passing back and forth over a cable right before it breaks, it can look suspicious.  
Sometimes, this is just mundane fishing activity—e.g., a trawler making multiple passes over the seabed to scoop up fish. It may even be legal, as not all countries have protected zones around cables.  
AIS data can also indicate where a vessel is flagged. However, it’s not uncommon for fishermen to find their catch well beyond their home country’s shores. China, for example, has the world’s largest fishing fleet, with vessels routinely traveling across the globe.  
_Map of Chinese-flagged fishing activity captured by AIS between 2019-2021. Source: [Oceana](https://usa.oceana.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/Oceana_ChinaFishing_FactSheet_PRINT.pdf)_  
AIS data isn’t always available. Sometimes, AIS is turned off on purpose in order to illegally fish in certain areas. Other times, transmitted data might not be picked up by receivers. (AIS is limited in range because it‘s transmitted wirelessly.)  
### What’s next?  
Official determination of a fault’s cause is best left to operators, maintenance crews, and government investigators.  
There are steps governments and cable developers can take to help reduce faults, including liaising with fishermen, burying cables near shorelines, and promoting cable diversity. To learn more, check out [the ICPC’s list of best practices](https://www.iscpc.org/publications/icpc-best-practices/).  
Meanwhile, we can find comfort in remembering that extraordinary circumstances and coincidences happen every day, and that most cable faults are just bad luck.

ABSTRACT  
Submarine Cable Installation Techniques and Alternatives  
Most movable bridges rely on submarine cables to provide power and control circuit conductors between near side, far side, and pivot piers. Traditional submarine cables utilize armored and waterproofed insulation to complete multi-conductor cable assemblies. Recent variations of the traditional types of submarine cables include fiber-optic cables and cables with hollow centers that act as flexible non-metallic raceways. Users can install various conductors and cables into the raceways and can remove and replace conductors over time. The installation and use of submarine cables for movable bridges has become increasingly difficult over the years due to permitting complexities, U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Army Corp of Engineers requirements for greater burial depths, exposure to deeper draft vessels, and scour conditions. With material and installation costs steadily rising, and manufacturing lead time increasing, many bridge owners and engineers are looking for alternatives.  
This paper will explore existing submarine cable materials and installation techniques. Non-traditional materials and methods will also be investigated including directionally bored multi-ducts. Utilidors, micro-tunnels, trenching techniques, and jacking and boring will also be explored. The paper will present movable bridge installations that do not use submarine or under-channel cables including wireless installations. Case history studies will be included with first-hand accounts from owners, engineers, and suppliers.  

I. Introduction  
The need for submarine cables has been in existence for over 150 years. The purpose of a submarine cable is to carry electrical power circuits, control circuits, and communication circuits from a near shore to a far shore under a body of saltwater; although the use of submarine cables also includes bodies of freshwater. Submarine cables came into existence around the 1850s to support the new telegraph communications technology. Samuel Morris proposed a submarine cable consisting of a single copper conductor to be installed from North America to Europe under the Atlantic Ocean. The present day construction of submarine cables has improved considerably since then; although many of the improvements that make the cable we use today came after World War II. Up until the 1940s, submarine cables consisted of raw rubber from rubber trees, jute, hemp, and copper. Present-day submarine cables also include the use of fiber-optic communications in addition to power and control circuits that use copper or aluminum conductors.  
This paper will discuss some of the traditional materials and installation techniques for submarine cable as they apply to the movable bridge industry. Movable bridge types include bascule spans, swing spans, vertical lift spans, and floating draw spans over navigable channels and waterways. As usual in the movable bridge industry, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for all types of bridges, or for all geographies and geometries when it comes to submarine cables. The design and material selections to support movable bridge installations require a substantial degree of customization. Six case studies will be explored for specific movable bridge installations. The names and locations of these bridges have been withheld due to Homeland Security concerns. This paper will also explore alternatives to the traditional submarine cable installations and will include directional boring, aerial cable alternatives, and wireless network communications for controls and interlocks. A simple cost analysis and comparison will be made among the alternative solutions.","The article 'Submarine Cable Installation Techniques and Alternatives' provides a comprehensive overview of submarine cables, their installation techniques, and their importance in movable bridge systems.

It discusses the challenges and historical context of submarine cables, which aligns with the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables.

Although it does not explicitly mention 'cut sea cables,' the extensive discussion of submarine cables and their implications for connectivity meets the requirement for this criterion."

The cables were cut about 140km off the coast of Sicily and are thought to have been damaged by a ship.

Egypt says it has been able to restore most of its communications by re-routing services, but other parts of the Middle East remain badly affected.

The same day, a suspected earthquake damaged the main cable to Malta.

On Sunday, the French repair ship Raymond Croze started work on two of the cables (SEA-ME-WE3 and 4) with the Italian vessel Teliri arriving the next day to work on the Flag Asia-Europe cable.

They three cables were cut within 40 minutes of each other, possibly by a trawler net or ship's anchor.

A ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) will locate the ends of the cables on the sea bed and bring them to the surface to be re-connected.

Flag Europe Asia said it expected to have the FLAG subsea cable repaired by 26 December, although that was dependent on weather and how badly damaged the cable was.

Jonathan Wright - director of wholesale products at Interoute which manages part of the optical fibre network - told the BBC that once one of the cables gets repaired, telecommunication companies will have far more options to get their services back online.

""SEA-ME-WE4 is the newest line. It has the largest capacity and so is probably the most critical line. Once that is repaired it should take some of the pressure off the one remaining cable.""

""As luck would have it, a second submarine line was being installed to Malta earlier this month and that should go on line today, which will help alleviate some of the communication problems Malta is suffering,"" he added.

Experts have warned that it may be days before the fault is fixed and that the knock-on effect could have serious repercussions on regional economies.

Lengthy process

Engineers from France Telecom Marine arrived at the site of the damage to the SEA-ME-WE4 and SEA-ME-WE3 lines onboard Raymond Croze at 1330 GMT on 21 December, spokesman Louis-Michel Aymard said.

The engineers then sent a remotely-operated submarine robot called ""Hector"" to the sea bed to begin the search for the two ends of each line.

It is unclear how long repairs to the two cables will take, as a ship could have dragged the cables several kilometres from their normal positions.

Once located, the cable ends will be brought to the surface by the robot and repairs will be carried out in a special facility on the ship - a process that could take days.

Engineers will deploy 'Hector' to retrieve cables from the sea floor

""We have to fix the cable fibre by fibre, and it's a very huge cable,"" Mr Aymard told the Associated Press.

France Telecom said it expected to repair SEA-ME-WE4 by 25 December and SEA-ME-WE3 by the end of the year.

In January the same line was damaged off Egypt's Mediterranean coast, severely disrupting internet and phone communications for many in the Middle East for days, although only two lines were snapped then.

A few hours before the three lines were cut, a suspected sub-sea earthquake damaged a local GO cable to Malta, severely disrupting communications to the island.","The article provides a comprehensive overview of the incident involving cut undersea cables, detailing the location, causes, and implications for communication services in affected regions.

“The cloud is not in the sky, it is under the sea.” That was a comment from an author of a government study to assess new potential disruptions of undersea communications cables.

Roughly [95 percent of intercontinental global data traffic](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/cyber-defense-across-the-ocean-floor-the-geopolitics-of-submarine-cable-security/) travels over undersea cables that run across the ocean floor. Globally, the international bandwidth used by network operators has nearly doubled from 2020 to 2022 and has now reached 3.9 Pbps, [according to TeleGeography.com](https://blog.telegeography.com/feast-your-eyes-on-the-2023-submarine-cable-map).

With such volumes of traffic being carried over the network of undersea cables, increased attention is being focused on the fragility of the system. A single cable cut can bring down services of the major cloud providers, as was the case [in an incident last year](https://blog.cloudflare.com/aae-1-smw5-cable-cuts/).

While most disruptions and cable cuts are caused by fishing or anchoring accidents, or natural disasters such as the [impact of the Tonga volcano](https://www.networkcomputing.com/networking/tonga-volcano-highlights-global-undersea-cable-network-fragility), there is growing concern about sabotage due to political unrest in Europe and the Far East. And new worries are emerging due to the impact of climate change.

On the political front, last year’s sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline, while not a communications cable, highlighted the vulnerability of undersea systems to nefarious actors.

More recently, the potential impact of climate change has been raised. Research [published in February](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825222003804) in the journal Earth-Science Reviews by scientists from the United Kingdom’s National Oceanography Centre and the University of Central Florida found that “ocean and nearshore disturbances caused by extreme weather events have exposed hot spots along the transglobal cable network, increasing the risk of internet outages.”

The researchers noted that intensifying tropical cyclones in the northern Pacific Ocean are stressing submarine cables off the coast of Taiwan. Any outage due to such a cause would not only disrupt communications and Internet traffic, but given the charged political environment, some might rush to judgment and falsely attribute the outage to China.

Cables that traverse polar regions, which are strategically important to many nations, are also impacted by climate change. Melting glacial and sea ice “are profoundly changing ocean conditions more rapidly than many other places on Earth,” according to the researchers.

“Our analysis clearly stresses the need to carefully plan cable routes and landing station locations factoring in a range of local hazards and how those are affected by climate change,” said co-author Thomas Wahl, an associate professor in UCF’s Department of Civil, Environmental and Construction Engineering, in a release.

Other researchers have been raising the climate change impact issues for years. For example, Nicole Starosielski, an associate professor of media, culture, and communications at New York University and author of the book “The Undersea Network,” has noted that while today’s submarine cables are built and placed with greater attention to disaster risk, many cable stations, where submarine cables terminate after coming ashore, were built before climate change was a consideration in builders’ minds.

Why is that an issue? Rising seas could accelerate erosion and increase the flood risk of onshore coastal cable facilities. And in hurricane and typhoon zones, severe storms will not only attack the coast but also influence the stability of the continental shelf seabed via the formation of eroding currents and waves, according to researchers. [Scientific American noted](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/global-internet-connectivity-is-at-risk-from-climate-disasters/) that such action could expose cables to more abrasion or suspensions above the seabed and trigger submarine landslides and greater turbidity.

### Safeguard efforts on the rise

Several things are being done to minimize undersea cable outages and service disruptions.

For example, fishing and anchoring annually account for approximately 70 percent of global damage to submarine cables—far more than other human or natural causes, according to [The International Cable Protection Committee](https://www.iscpc.org/) (ICPC). As such, the group, which is comprised of governmental administrations and commercial companies that own or operate submarine cables, developed best practices to avoid these problems.

Suggested ways to mitigate and limit damage from fishing and anchoring include route selection and design to avoid areas of particular risk (for example, routing around designated anchorages); cable armoring; cable burial for cables installed at water depths less than 1500 meters; cable awareness and liaison programs designed to educate fishing fleets regarding the location of submarine cables, and actions to take if gear is snagged; and programs to compensate fishermen for snagged gear (so that they abandon snagged gear rather than damage cables in trying to free it).

There are also several publicly announced government efforts that try to address the increased threat due to today's turbulent political times. A [2022 report](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2022/702557/EXPO_IDA(2022)702557_EN.pdf) by the European Parliament on security threats to undersea communications cables and infrastructure and their consequences for the EU noted that a key aspect of cable protection is appropriate surveillance and identification of suspicious activities.

To date, cable surveillance is currently mainly provided by the industry. Some countries are doing more. Triggered by the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline, Briton’s Defense Secretary Ben Wallace [said](https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/britain-to-build-second-undersea-cable-protection-ship/): “We have committed to two specialist ships with the capability to keep our cables and pipelines safe.”

Specifically, the country said it would expand its Multi-Role Ocean Surveillance Ship project. The project will now include two ships fitted with advanced sensors and carrying a number of remotely operated and autonomous undersea drones.

These recent efforts complement NATO efforts that have been underway for several years. In particular, commenting on an assessment of Russian threats to the security of undersea cables and critical infrastructure, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""I think it is important to address this because it is important to understand that most of these cables are privately owned, and it's publicly known where they are. That makes them potentially vulnerable.” As a result, NATO has reacted by doing more naval exercises and patrols at sea.

Internet connectivity between parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe suddenly slowed on February 24 when three undersea cables were damaged in the Red Sea. This caused “a significant impact on communication networks in the Middle East,” according to Hong Kong telecoms company HGC Global Communications. The Red Sea is a choke point for global maritime trade—a fact Yemen’s Houthi rebels have taken advantage of by targeting global shipping with missile attacks in recent months. But the sea is also an internet and telecommunications bottleneck. An estimated 90 percent of communications between Europe and Asia and 17 percent of global internet traffic traverse cables under the 14-mile-wide Bab al Mandab Strait.

The Yemeni government warned in early February that Houthi rebels might target undersea cables. Although the rebels denied responsibility, it turned out they were in fact culpable—just not in the way many had expected. According to U.S. officials, the cables were cut by the anchor of the sinking ship the _Rubymar_, a UK-owned commercial vessel that took on water after it was struck by a missile fired by the Houthis on February 18. The ship then dropped its anchor and drifted for several days. It finally sank on Saturday.

#### **Vital and Vulnerable**

This is the latest of several recent incidents involving high-profile damage and disruption to undersea infrastructure. Internet cables near Svalbard and the Shetland Islands were cut in 2022, the same year the Nord Stream gas pipelines were sabotaged. Last year the _Balticconnector_ pipeline between Finland and Estonia was damaged along with two subsea cables when the Chinese-owned commercial ship the _Newnew Polar Bear_ dragged its anchor across them. These episodes highlight the vulnerability of vital undersea infrastructure around the world. The NATO alliance was so concerned it opened a new center last year for securing undersea infrastructure.

Around 97 percent of global data runs through a few hundred undersea cables. These cables are vital to the global information economy, spanning over 1.4 million kilometers and connecting nearly every country in the world. This number is growing as big tech companies lay and operate their own cables. Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft alone now control around half of all undersea bandwidth worldwide.

But seabed cables and other undersea infrastructure, like oil and gas pipelines or ocean wind farms, are vulnerable. As the Red Sea incident highlights, they are fast becoming the soft underbelly of the world economy. The scale and nature of this infrastructure makes it difficult to protect. Undersea infrastructure also makes a good target for those operating in the murky gray zone of deniable attacks short of war. For example, over 70 percent of cable faults are not intentional. Damage can be caused by fishing nets, anchors, weather, shark bites—and now sinking cargo ships. This makes it difficult to distinguish between accident and attack, something potential saboteurs can take advantage of to avoid detection. Cables and pipelines are also easy to locate as companies make their location public to aid navigation and minimize accidents.

Recent incidents show what is possible with these tactics. The 2022 Nord Stream explosions transformed the European energy landscape and sent political shockwaves across Europe, yet more than a year of investigations has yielded no firm conclusions. The 2023 _Balticconnector_ incident was deemed likely by Finland to be an “intentional” attack, although investigations continue. The most recent Red Sea incident was judged “an exceptionally rare occurrence,” but it is one that is becoming more common as more undersea infrastructure is at risk to proliferating conflicts around the world.

No state actors have been implicated in these incidents, but several have advanced capabilities to target undersea infrastructure. The United Kingdom warned of Russia’s threat to undersea cables in 2017. Russia has long operated advanced capabilities for seabed sabotage and has recently been caught mapping European maritime infrastructure. Iran’s submarine fleet is small but potent and capable of Red Sea operations. China’s navy is now the world’s largest, and U.S. officials have expressed concern over the Chinese firm Huawei’s involvement in scores of global seabed cable projects, which “could allow China to attach devices that divert or monitor data traffic—or, in a conflict, to sever links to entire nations.”

#### **Boost Resilience and Enhance Maritime Awareness**

There are no easy solutions for securing undersea infrastructure. Deterring gray zone aggression is difficult but not impossible. However, International governments and companies can act now in two important areas: boosting resilience and enhancing maritime domain awareness. Both would be furthered by improving public-private coordination, especially given the security and financial risks from vulnerable undersea infrastructure.

The best way to prevent attacks on vital and vulnerable undersea infrastructure is to build more resilient systems. As the UN principles for resilience infrastructure emphasize, new projects can be protected from the start by ensuring systems are hardened, fail-safe, have sufficient redundancy and are quickly recoverable. Since the 9/11 attacks, government buildings in the U.S. have been surrounded with simple measures like concrete bollards to prevent truck bombs. Airliners are equipped with locking, reinforced cockpit doors, for example. Protecting undersea infrastructure may require the same shift in mentality to proactive resilience by design.

However, true resilience is costly and impractical for existing cables that runs thousands of kilometers along the seabed. If building resilience is a long-term endeavor, a short-term solution is to remove the cloak of ambiguity from hostile actors by enhancing maritime awareness. Much like the “you are being watched” signs under surveillance cameras, doing so would strengthen deterrence by detection—hostile actors are less likely to attack undersea.","The article titled ""Red Sea Cable Damage Reveals Soft Underbelly of Global Economy"" discusses the damage to three undersea cables in the Red Sea, which occurred on February 24, 2024.

It details how these cables were cut by the anchor of a sinking ship, highlighting both the cause and significant effects on internet connectivity between Asia, Africa, and Europe.

The article emphasizes the vulnerability of undersea infrastructure and its implications for global communications, making it clear that the focus is primarily on cut sea cables rather than a brief mention within a broader context.

Mindestens 95 Prozent des Internetdatentransfers läuft durch die rund 500 Seekabel auf dem Grund der Ozeane und Meere. Der Kampf um die Kabel wird von Großmächten wie den USA, Russland und China verbissen geführt. Beobachter machen mehrere Entwicklungen für die rasante Zunahme von Scharmützeln unter Wasser aus. Länder wie Frankreich oder Großbritannien rüsten sich zum Unterwasserkrieg.

Historiker datieren den ersten Angriff auf ein Seekabel auf 1898. Damals kappte das US-Kampfschiff „Zafiro“ während des Spanisch-Amerikanischen Kriegs im Golf von Manila das Kabel, das die philippinische Hauptstadt mit dem asiatischen Kontinent verband.

2007 etwa durchtrennten vietnamesische Fischer ein Unterseekabel, um dessen Verbundwerkstoffe zu bergen und weiterzuverkaufen. Bei der Aktion verlor Vietnam für drei Wochen fast vollständig die Verbindung zum Rest der Welt.

Erst Anfang November 2021 stellten Ermittler nach Störungs- und Ausfallmeldungen von Meeresforschern fest, dass von einem Seekabel vor der Küste Norwegens, das wissenschaftlichen Zwecken diente, 4,3 Kilometer fehlten. Der Vorfall konnte bis heute nicht aufgeklärt werden.

Der Kampf um die Kabel, so Experten, wird von den Großmächten wie den USA, Russland und China verbissen und vor allem möglichst geheim geführt. Experten nennen mehrere Entwicklungen für die rasante Zunahme von Scharmützeln unter Wasser. 

Die physikalische Verwundbarkeit der Nervenstränge des World Wide Web ist jedoch lange in Europa als Problem vernachlässigt worden. Bislang geht bei den jährlich weltweit knapp über 100 Kabelbrüchen die größte Gefahr von mächtigen Fischernetzen oder vom Ankerlichten aus. 

Die Zusammenarbeit von Diensten und Behörden wäre sehr hilfreich. So könnten allein in Deutschland die Daten der Radarsicherungskette, des international üblichen Automatischen Identifikationssystems AIS mit optischen und akustischen Beobachtungen der Bundesmarine zu einem Lagebild zusammengefasst werden. 

In Europa gibt es ein Überwachungssystem zur Beobachtung maritimer Aktivitäten, das Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE). Es verfügt jedoch kaum über Daten, die privaten Kabelunternehmen zur Verfügung stehen. 

Frankreich und Großbritannien vertrauen sich in dieser Frage lieber selbst. Auch Portugal betrachtet den Unterwasserschutz als militärisches „Schlüsselthema"".

**Author:** Robert McMillan  
**Published Date:** 08/15/2014  

There are many, many things that can go wrong as you lay thousands of miles of fiber optic cable along the ocean's floor. Earthquakes can rip things up, as can fishing hooks. But now we know of a new threat: Shark attacks.

According to Network World, Google Product Manager Dan Belcher told folks at a Google marketing event in Boston last week that Google ensures its cable is sheathed in a Kevlar-like protective coating to keep the sharks from chomping through the line. Turns out this is standard operating procedure among undersea cable-layers, who must take a number of steps to keep aquatic life from harming (or being harmed by) data cables.

We asked Google about this, and if they have any idea why sharks would want to eat fiber optic cables, but they had nothing to say. But apparently it's a thing, as you can see in the video below.

As Google expands its online empire, undersea cables are becoming an increasingly important part of the plan. The company has invested in two major undersea cables connecting the western US to Asia, and a third cable that extends Google's network within Asia. That's where the big data bottleneck is these days, and a lack of fiber connectivity can push up market prices for moving data between the two continents. That is unless, like Google, you have access to your very own cables.

We've long known squirrels are a major problem to anyone laying cable, but according to a report by the International Cable Protection Committee cable bites---by sharks and other fish---remain a surprisingly persistent problem. In the 1980s, a deep-ocean fiber-optic cable was cut four times. Researchers blame crocodile sharks for those attacks after finding teeth in the cable.

The cable protection folks really have no idea why sharks bite cables either, although some suggest it may be due to ""electro magnetic fields from a suspended cable strumming in currents,"" they say in their report.

>If you had just a piece of plastic out there shaped like a cable, there's a good chance they'd bite that too.

Sharks, like other animals, can detect magnetic fields -- and they have miniature volt sensors in their mouths that they use to detect prey and mates. But there's a simpler explanation, says Chris Lowe, the professor who runs California State University, Long Beach's Shark Lab. They may simply be curious. ""If you had just a piece of plastic out there shaped like a cable, there's a good chance they'd bite that too."" But even an exploratory nibble is enough to cause some serious trouble. ""Just a little bite is enough to get through the jacket, damage the fibers and then you're screwed,"" Lowe says.

More recently, Level 3 Communications technicians did come across a three foot long shark in a trench near its fiber cable---two miles inland---in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Maybe it was looking for a bite.","The article titled ""Sharks Want to Bite Google's Undersea Cables"" discusses the interactions between sharks and undersea cables in detail.

It outlines how sharks can damage these cables, the reasons for their behavior, and the consequences of such damage on internet connectivity.

The article specifically mentions incidents of cable cuts caused by sharks, including historical references to previous occurrences.

Cloudflare’s network spans more than 310 cities in over 120 countries, where we interconnect with over 13,000 network providers in order to provide a broad range of services to millions of customers. The breadth of both our network and our customer base provides us with a unique perspective on Internet resilience, enabling us to observe the impact of Internet disruptions. Thanks to recently released Cloudflare Radar functionality, this quarter we have started to explore the impact from a routing perspective, as well as a traffic perspective, at both a network and location level.

The first quarter of 2024 kicked off with quite a few Internet disruptions. Damage to both terrestrial and submarine cables caused problems in a number of locations, while military action related to ongoing geopolitical conflicts impacted connectivity in other areas. Governments in several African countries, as well as Pakistan, ordered Internet shutdowns, focusing heavily on mobile connectivity. Malicious actors known as Anonymous Sudan claimed responsibility for cyberattacks that disrupted Internet connectivity in Israel and Bahrain. Maintenance and power outages forced users offline, resulting in observed drops in traffic. And in a more unusual turn, RPKI, DNS, and DNSSEC issues were among the technical problems that disrupted connectivity for subscribers across multiple network providers.

### Cable cuts

**Moov Africa Tchad**  
Reported fiber optic cable damage that occurred in Cameroon on January 10 further disrupted connectivity for customers of AS327802 (Moov Africa Tchad / Millicom) a telecommunications provider in Chad. According to a (translated) Facebook post from Moov Africa Tchad, “On the afternoon of January 10, 2024, there was a breakdown of the internet due to a cut in the optical fiber coming from Cameroon through which Chad has access to the internet, the one coming from Sudan being unavailable for a while.” It is unclear whether the referenced cable cut occurred in Cameroon or Chad, and the mentioned Sudan cable issue may be the one covered in our Q4 2023 summary post. As a landlocked country, Chad is dependent on terrestrial Internet connections to/through neighboring countries, and the AfTerFibre cable map illustrates Chad’s reliance on limited cable paths through Cameroon and Sudan.

The graphs below show that Moov Africa Tchad traffic was disrupted for over 12 hours starting midday (UTC) on January 10, and the disruption was visible at a country level as well. The fiber cut also resulted in significant volatility from a routing perspective, as the volume of announced IPv4 address space shifted frequently at a network and country level during the disruption.

A second less severe disruption was also observed during the morning (UTC) of January 11. That disruption was reportedly due to an alleged cyberattack by Anonymous Sudan that targeted AS328594 (SudaChad Telecom), which is an upstream provider for Moov Africa Tchad.

**Orange Burkina Faso**  
On February 15, a brief (~30 minute) but complete significant Internet disruption was observed at AS37577 (Orange Burkina Faso). According to the translation of a communiqué posted by the provider on social media, “The incident is due to a fiber cut, which causes a disruption of Internet services for certain customers.” Orange did not specify whether it was a more localized fiber cut, or damage to one of the terrestrial fibers that cross the country. The incident took the network completely offline, as the ASN’s amount of announced IPv4 address space dropped to zero for the duration.

**MTN Nigeria**  
MTN Nigeria turned to social media on February 28 to let customers know that “You have been experiencing challenges connecting to the network due to a major service outage caused by multiple fibre cuts, affecting voice and data services.” A published report described the impact, noting “Millions of customers nationwide were impacted by the hours-long outage, especially in Lagos.” Connectivity was disrupted for approximately seven hours between 13:30 - 20:30 local time (12:30 - 19:30 UTC), and the provider posted a followup note just before midnight local time stating that service had been fully restored.

**Digicel Haiti**  
A 16-hour Internet disruption on March 2/3 at AS27653 (Digicel Haiti) was due to a double fiber cut as a result of violence related to attempts to oust Prime Minister Ariel Henry. Starting around 22:00 local time on March 2 (03:00 on March 3), a complete outage was observed for approximately nine hours. Some recovery in traffic occurred for approximately two-and-a-half hours, followed by a three hour near-complete disruption. Digicel Haiti effectively disappeared from the Internet during the nine-hour outage, as no IPv4 or IPv6 address space was announced by the network during that time.

**SKY (Philippines)**  
A brief traffic disruption observed on AS23944 (SKY) in the Philippines on March 18 was likely related to a fiber cut. In an advisory posted by SKY on social media, they stated that “SKY services in several areas in Marikina, Pasig and Quezon City are currently affected by a cut-fiber issue”, listing 45 affected areas. Traffic was most significantly impacted between 20:00 - 21:00 local time (12:00 - 13:00 UTC), although full recovery took several more hours. Only a minor impact to routing resulting from the fiber cut was observed.

**Multiple African countries**  
On March 14, damage to multiple submarine cables off the west coast of Africa impacted Internet connectivity across multiple countries in West and Southern Africa. The damage was reportedly caused by underwater rock falls, and in addition to disrupting Internet connectivity, also caused availability issues for Microsoft Azure and Office 365 cloud services.

The Africa Coast to Europe (ACE), Submarine Atlantic 3/West Africa Submarine Cable (SAT-3/WASC), West Africa Cable System (WACS), and MainOne cables were all damaged, and impacted 13 African countries including Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, and others.","The article ""Q1 2024 Internet disruption summary"" discusses multiple incidents involving cut sea cables in detail.

**Author:** Patrick J. Kiger  
**Published Date:** 01/04/2018  

The head of the British defense establishment and chairman of NATO's military committee, Air Marshall Sir Stuart Peach, recently warned that cutting the cables ""would immediately — and catastrophically — fracture both international trade and the internet,"" according to the Guardian.  
Peach's warning echoed the conclusions of a 2017 report written by U.K. Member of Parliament Rishi Sunak, which described the potential for disruption of internet traffic as an ""existential threat."" Sunak noted that the cables, which are largely owned and operated by private companies, transmit $10 trillion in financial transfers each day.  
It's not the first time that an alarm has been sounded about the undersea cable networks. This 2010 report written for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, describes the effects of a 2008 incident in which three cables in the Mediterranean that connected Italy to Egypt were severed, apparently accidentally by commercial ships dragging their anchors. Eighty percent of the internet connectivity between Europe and the Middle East temporarily was lost. As a result, most of the U.S. Air Force's drone aircraft in Iraq were grounded, due to the lack of a reliable connection to technicians back in the U.S. ""Cable breaks halfway across the world threaten U.S. vital national security interests,"" the report warned.  
In 2015, The New York Times reported that a Russian spy ship, the Yantar, was kept under surveillance by U.S. planes, satellites and ships as it cruised slowly down the U.S. east coast, close to internet cables. The Russian ship reportedly was equipped with two miniature submarines capable of going into deep water to cut cables. Another Russian surveillance ship, the Viktor Leonov, was spotted off the coast of Delaware in February, according to the Christian Science Monitor.  
But before you get too caught up in a nightmare scenario of the internet suddenly going dark due to sabotage, experts say the system — despite its lack of defenses — is resilient and would be difficult for an enemy nation or terrorist group to disable. The fiber cables that transmit the world's data are surprisingly slim, measuring less than 0.7 inches (17 millimeters) in thickness, according to Keith Schofield, general manager of the International Cable Protection Committee, a British-based industry group. But the fiber is encased in a hermetically sealed tube, which is in turn surrounded by layers of high-tensile steel wires, copper and polyethylene. For sections in shallower water, where cables are more likely to encounter ship anchors and other manmade hazards, additional layers of armor are sometimes added, or else cables are buried under the seabed, Schofield says in an email.  
As a result, cables are damaged worldwide only about 200 times a year — ""a tiny failure rate across a network of well over a million kilometers (621,000 miles) of cable linking people between continents,"" Schofield says.  
It would be difficult to cut cables in the deep ocean, though a robotic submersible equipped with the right tools could pull it off, says Jim Hayes, president of the Fiber Optic Association, a California-based professional society that certifies cable network builders and operators, in a telephone interview. The cable networks are more vulnerable closer to land, where their connections are in shallower water and easier to reach. It wouldn't take a lot of sophisticated weapons or know-how to inflict the desired damage.  
""If you want to interrupt communications, you hire a crappy old fishing trawler, give them a big anchor and tell them to drag it here,"" Hayes explains.","The article 'Could an Attack on Undersea Cables Take Down the Internet?' extensively discusses undersea cables, their vulnerabilities, and the implications of cutting them.

It includes direct mentions of 'undersea cables' and outlines significant historical incidents where cable severance disrupted internet connectivity, such as the 2008 incident that affected communication between Europe and the Middle East.

Maybe you've been scrolling through our [blogs about recent cable breaks](https://blog.telegeography.com/telecom-headlines-february-2020). Or perhaps it just feels like there's been an uptick of [cable fault chatter online](https://twitter.com/philBE2/status/1233418963322798080). Either way, disruptions to service have made their way into a few spring headlines.

> From recent returns to service in Egypt to repairs in South Africa, ingrained repair processes and contingency plans have recovered service on a number of subsea cable systems.  
  
[Repairing cables](https://blog.telegeography.com/repairing-a-damaged-submarine-cable-how-the-mainone-was-restored) is simply part of the process for a cable-dependent society. And we've gotten good at it!  
  
There's a reason that we rarely hear about these cable faults—and that recent headlines are more of an exception than the rule. It's because most companies that use cables follow a “safety in numbers” approach to usage, spreading their networks' capacity over multiple cables. If one breaks, their network will run smoothly over other cables while service is restored on the damaged one.  
  
Accidents like fishing vessels and ships dragging anchors account for two-thirds of all cable faults. Environmental factors like earthquakes also contribute to damage. In the [recent example out of Egypt](https://www.capacitymedia.com/articles/3825130/telecom-egypt-swiftly-recovers-services-on-subsea-cable-systems?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=social%20organic&utm_campaign=Telecom%20Egypt%20Sponsored%20Content%20March%202020), service was interrupted as a result of terrestrial cable cuts resulting from an unusually powerful storm.  
  
> Environmental factors like earthquakes also contribute to damage. In the recent example out of Egypt, service was interrupted as a result of terrestrial cable cuts resulting from an unusually powerful storm.  
  
And let's consider the context. As of 2020, we believe there are over 1.2 million kilometers of submarine cables in service globally. Even though we don't always hear about them, cable faults are common. On average, there are over 100 each year.

"Four Submarine Internet Cables Cut in Red Sea; Houthis Deny Involvement","25% of internet traffic disrupted across the Middle East, India, Pakistan, and East Africa due to the cutting of four major submarine cables.","https://www.wionews.com/world/at-least-four-submarine-internet-cables-cut-in-red-sea-houthis-deny-role-696642","2024-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","Vikrant Singh",Yes,"Vikrant Singh","Noida, India","100000","2024-03-05","English","WION","**At least four submarine internet cables ‘cut’ in Red Sea, Houthis deny role**  

**Story highlights**  
It must be noted that there are more than 15 submarine internet cables in the Red Sea, a region witnessing massive shipping disruption due to attacks by Yemen-based Houthi rebels in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war.  

Submarine internet cables have been “cut” in the Red Sea, causing “significant” disruption to communications networks in the Middle East, said Hong Kong telecoms company HGC Global Communications. Cables belonging to four major operators have been cut, which might impact internet traffic in India, Pakistan, and parts of East Africa as well. HGC Global claims at least 25 per cent of the traffic has been impacted and operators were now rerouting traffic to keep disruptions to a minimum and “extending assistance to affected businesses"".

The company said it was “extremely rare” to have four cables damaged simultaneously.  

**Cause of the cuts**  
None of the operators have yet disclosed the reason behind the cuts. Yemen also denied its role in the suspected sabotage, saying it was “keen to keep all telecom submarine cables…away from any possible risks.”  

However, the West-backed Yemeni government in previous weeks had warned that Houthi rebels might seek to disrupt these cables to show support for Hamas and force the world to press Israel to stop attacks in Gaza.  

Yemeni rebel leader Abdel Malek al-Houthi denied the allegations. “We have no intention of targeting sea cables providing internet to countries in the region,” he said.

**When are repairs expected?**  
CNN quoted South Africa-based Seacom, which owns one of the cable systems affected, as saying that the repair work won’t start for at least another month, as it needed to secure permits to operate in the sea.  

Meanwhile, the continued security crisis in the Red Sea might also induce further delay in the repair work.  

Underwater cables serve as the backbone of the internet, often financed in recent years by tech titans like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook. Disruptions to these subsea networks can lead to extensive internet blackouts, as seen in the aftermath of the Taiwan earthquake in 2006.

An entire country was left without internet access for two days after an undersea cable was damaged.

Mauritania was left offline for 48 hours after the African Coast to Europe (ACE) submarine cable was severed, according to infrastructure analysts. Nine other west African nations were affected by outages.

The cable system stretches 10,500 miles (17,000 kilometres) from France to South Africa, helping to provide internet connection to 22 countries – mostly on Africa’s west coast.

A large part of the west of the continent was affected by outages, first reported on 30 March, after the cable broke near the Mauritanian capital Noukachott. It is thought to have been snapped by a trawler.

Mauritania, which relies solely on ACE to stay connected, was left offline for 48 hours, according to internet performance firm Dyn.

Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, and the Gambia also experienced significant disruption, while Benin, Senegal, Equatorial Guinea and the Ivory Coast all saw less serious problems.

“The most significant, and longest-lasting disruption was seen in Mauritania, with a complete outage lasting for nearly 48 hours, followed by partial restoration of connectivity,” said David Belson, senior director of internet research and analysis at Dyn.

He added: “The differences in duration and severity may be related to the other international internet connections, via terrestrial cable or satellite, that the providers in these countries have in place, resulting in varying levels of reliance on the ACE cable system.”

The director of networks and international services at Orange, which heads the consortium of 19 organisations which manage ACE, tweeted a picture of the severed cable taken by workers on a maintenance vessel sent to repair it.

Jean-Luc Vuillemin said a trawler raising the cable off the seabed and slicing through it was the “likely cause” of the “major breakdown.”

It is the first major outage since ACE became operational in 2012.

The head of the UK’s armed forces last year warned of the vulnerability of undersea communication cables, which he said could be targeted by aggressors such as Russia.

Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, the chief of the UK defence staff, said Moscow’s ability to interfere with deep-sea cables posed a potentially “catastrophic threat” to the internet and international trade.

Conservative MP Rishi Sunak also warned in a Policy Exchange report in December that terrorists could use grappling hooks attached to fishing trawlers to strike a “crippling blow” to Britain’s network.","The article titled ""Entire country taken offline for two days after undersea internet cable cut"" from The Independent discusses a significant incident involving the severing of the ACE submarine cable, which resulted in Mauritania being offline for 48 hours and affected nine other West African nations.

"SA’s Internet Outage Due to WACS Cable Break","Major internet outages across all South African ISPs following the second WACS undersea cable break this year, impacting connectivity during COVID-19 lockdown.","https://gadget.co.za/sas-internet-goes-down-again","","Arthur Goldstuck",Yes,"Arthur Goldstuck","South Africa",-,"2020-03-28","English","GadgetZA","Internet service provider Afrihost has notified customers that there are major outages across all South African Internet Service Providers (ISPs), as a result of a break in the WACS undersea cable between Portugal and England.

The cause of the cable break along the cable is unclear. It marks the second major breakage event along the West African Internet sea cables this year, and comes at the worst possible time: as South Africans grow heavily dependent on their Internet connections during the COVID-19 lockdown.

As a result of the break, the use of international websites and services, which include VPNs (virtual private networks), may result in latency – decreased speeds and response times.

WACS runs from Yzerfontein in the Western Cape, up the West Coast of Africa, and terminates in the United Kingdom. It makes a stop in Portugal before it reaches the UK, and the breakage is reportedly somewhere between these two countries.

The cable is owned in portions by several companies, and the portion where the breakage has occurred belongs to Tata Communications.

The alternate routes are:
* SAT3, which runs from Melkbosstrand also in the Western Cape, up the West Coast and terminates in Portugal and Spain. This cable runs nearly parallel to WACS and has less Internet capacity than WACS.
* ACE (Africa Coast to Europe), which also runs up the West Coast.
* The SEACOM cable runs from South Africa, up the East Coast of Africa, terminating in both London and Dubai.
* The EASSy cable also runs from South Africa, up the East Coast, terminating in Sudan, from where it connects to other cables.

The routes most ISPs in South Africa use are WACS and SAT3, due to cost reasons.

The impact will not be as severe as in January, though. All international traffic is being redirected via alternative cable routes. This may be a viable method for connecting users to the Internet but might not be suitable for latency-sensitive applications like International video conferencing.","The article titled 'SA’s Internet goes down again' discusses a break in the WACS undersea cable, which is directly related to the topic of cut sea cables.

It provides details about the breakage, mentioning that it is the second major incident this year affecting the West African Internet sea cables.

The article explains that the cable break has led to major internet outages across all South African ISPs and describes the impact on internet connectivity, particularly during the COVID-19 lockdown.

It also discusses alternative routes for internet traffic, which demonstrates the significance of the cable cuts.

"Submarine Internet Cable Disruptions in 2022","Reports on four disruptions affecting key cables, including APG's latest issue on December 26, 2022, impacting internet speed and reliability for Vietnam.","https://en.vietnamplus.vn/submarine-internet-cable-sees-disruptions-for-fourth-time-in-2022-post246192.vnp","","Vietnam+ (VietnamPlus)",Yes,"Vietnam+ (VietnamPlus)","Hanoi, Vietnam","60000","2022-12-27","Vietnamese","VietnamPlus","Three international undersea cables out of the primary five connecting Vietnam to the world are suffering issues, which could seriously impact connection speed and reliability.

Hanoi (VNS/VNA) - Three international undersea cables out of the primary five connecting Vietnam to the world are suffering issues, which could seriously impact connection speed and reliability. The Asia Pacific Gateway (APG) was the latest – following Asia America Gateway (AAG) and AAE-1 (Asia-Africa-Euro 1) – to see disruptions after a problem on the S6 segment (near Hong Kong, China) was reported on December 26 morning, according to an internet service provider.

This is the fourth time in 2022 the cable faced problems, after problems in April, July, and September. The September issue suffered a problem on the S9 segment (to Singapore) and was only fully repaired on November 14.

Vietnamese internet service providers have yet to receive notices from the cable management unit on the causes or the repair plans for the current issue.

The 10,400km-long APG line was first operational in December 2016. It was invested by four Vietnamese internet service providers – VNPT, Viettel, FPT and CMC.

AAE-1 was suffering from a ‘shunt fault’ problem on the S1H segment, also near Hong Kong area, since November this year. The AAG is seeing several issues on S1B and S1B segments (near Brunei) and S1H and S1I segments (near Hong Kong).

The problems on these lines have not been fully addressed yet, making it harder for internet providers to ensure the quality of the connections to their consumers.

Only two other lines that connect Vietnam to the world – SMW3 (SEA-ME-WE3) and Intra Asia (IA) – are running without disruptions.","The article titled 'Submarine internet cable sees disruptions for fourth time in 2022' provides detailed information about multiple disruptions affecting key submarine cables connecting Vietnam to the global internet.

*   2006: Seebeben vor Taiwan, Kabel brechen. 120 Millionen Telefonanschlüsse in Ostasien fallen aus, das Internet wechselt in den Schneckenmodus, Banken und Börsen sind vom internationalen Handel abgeschnitten. Zeitweilig muss der Devisenhandel weltweit ausgesetzt werden.
*   2008: Bizarre Pannenserie in der arabischen Welt. Zweimal reißen Kabel vor Ägypten, zweimal im Persischen Golf - innerhalb weniger Tage. Die ganze Region bleibt 18 Tage lang auf Schleichfahrt, bis zu 100 Millionen Menschen sind über Tage komplett offline.
*   2010: Ein Anker zerfetzt ein Kabel vor Südafrika. Internationale Telekommunikation und Internet kollabieren.
*   2012: Die Telekommunikation in Ostafrika versinkt mit dem Anker eines Schiffes.

Manche Seekabel werden Opfer von Naturkatastrophen, einige vielleicht von Sabotage. Doch die Hauptursache für die Durchtrennung wichtiger Datenleitungen sind Unfälle mit Schleppnetzen und Bootsankern.

Der kurioseste Fall ereignete sich allerdings 2011 an Land: Da zersägte angeblich die 75-jährige Rentnerin Hajastan S. ein Kabel, um es als Schrott zu verkaufen. Die Republiken Armenien und Georgien gingen offline - die Rentnerin bestritt die Vorwürfe allerdings.

**Cyberwar? Weit leichter und schlimmer als gedacht**

So ein Vollkollaps wäre sogar gewaltlos möglich. Zumindest die internationalen Verbindungen könnten die USA durch ihren zentralen Zugriff auf das Root-Server-System des Internets und ihre Mittenstellung in den transkontinentalen Telefon-Kabelwegen ganz einfach abschalten. Wie weit der lauschende Zugriff des US-Geheimdienstes NSA auf die internationalen Kabelwege geht, ist durch die Enthüllungen Edward Snowdens bestätigt worden. Der Blick auf die Karten, die die internationalen Seekabel verzeichnen, macht klar, dass man für Spionage wie Sabotage nur Zugriff auf überraschend wenige Verbindungspunkte braucht.

Drahtlose Techniken und Satelliten spielen beim Datentransport nur eine marginale Rolle. Sie sind in keiner Weise ausreichend oder geeignet, die Drähte zu ersetzen, die uns vernetzen. Die luftige Allegorie von der ""Cloud"" ist ein schiefes Bild: Unsere Daten lagern an physischen Orten, verbunden über oft nur armdicke Kabel.

Die haben es allerdings in sich. So sind Australien und Neuseeland mit Südostasien über ein Untersee-Glasfaserkabel verbunden, das allein in der Lage ist, 20 Millionen Telefonanrufe parallel zu übertragen.

**Die Achillesferse der modernen Welt**

Was beeindruckend klingt, macht uns aber auch beeindruckend verletzlich: Wahrscheinlich sind die Kabelwege unter allen kritischen Infrastrukturen diejenigen, bei denen man mit dem niedrigsten Aufwand den höchsten Schaden verursachen kann.

Redundante Strukturen, die Ausfälle abfedern können, gibt es natürlich, aber letztlich sind vor allem die See-Infrastrukturen auf Kante genäht - klar, wenn man bedenkt, dass jede Trasse Milliarden kostet. Die Seekabel sind die Achillesferse der Netzstrukturen.

Man hört und liest so etwas selten. Vielleicht, weil das Verlegen von Kabeln weit weniger sexy ist, als Satelliten auf Raketen in den Orbit zu schicken? Das glaubt zumindest Nicole Starosielski, die mit ihrem für Mitte März angekündigten Buch ""The Undersea Network"" auch Bewusstsein dafür schaffen will, wie fragil unsere Netzinfrastrukturen sind.

**Epochale Reportage von Neal Stephenson**

Fast 20 Jahre nach Neal Stephensons epochaler Kabel-Reportage ""Mother Earth Mother Board"" wagt sich die Journalistin an ein Porträt der weltweiten Kabelwege - und rollt nebenbei deren ökonomische, soziale, ökologische und machtpolitische Wirkungen und Nebenwirkungen auf. Dazu gehört das Web-Projekt Surfacing, das ab Mitte März Karte, bebilderter Katalog und Informationsdatenbank zum Thema Seekabel sein will.

Deren Trassen sind in überraschend vielen Fällen dieselben wie die der ersten, im 19. Jahrhundert verlegten Kupferkabel, berichtet Starosielski. Oft lägen da ""Kabel auf Kabeln"".

Das passt zu den neuesten Karten, die TeleGeography gerade herausgegeben hat: moderne Karten im Stil uralter Weltkarten. Doch ob modern oder nostalgisch, es ist erkenntnisreich, den Kabelwegen zu folgen. Vielleicht kommt ja irgendwann sogar die Eine-Million-Euro-Frage bei Günther Jauch: ""Über wie viele Seekabel-Zugangspunkte ist Deutschland mit dem Internet verbunden?""

Kleiner Tipp: Sagen Sie Fünf.","The article discusses multiple incidents involving undersea cables, detailing specific events where cables were cut and the resulting impacts on global communication.

It mentions significant historical examples, such as the 2000 incident with a fishing boat's anchor and the 2006 earthquake near Taiwan, illustrating the fragility and critical importance of these cables.

The focus on the causes and consequences of cable cuts further supports its relevance to the criterion."
"Ship's Anchor Causes Internet Cable Cut","Significant outages in the Middle East and Asia due to a ship's anchor cutting cables in the Persian Gulf, 35 miles north of Dubai.","https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna23068571","","By By Katarina Kratovac",Yes,"Katarina Kratovac","New York, NY, USA","10000","2008-02-08","English","NBC News","A ship's anchor lying at the bottom of the sea was behind one of two cuts last week in undersea Internet cables around the Middle East that caused dramatic outages across the region and in parts of Asia, the cable-owner company said Friday.

FLAG Telecom said its repair ship managed to recover one end of the cut FALCON cable in the Persian Gulf, 35 miles north of Dubai, between the Emirates and Oman.

At the site, FLAG's repair crew discovered an abandoned anchor which the company said was behind the cut last Friday. The anchor, weighing more than 5 tons, was pulled up to the surface.

It was not immediately clear whether FLAG had any indication what vessel the anchor belonged to, or how such a heavy anchor could have moved to snap the cable or whether the cable itself was drifting and why.

At the time of the cut — the second in three days and involving three separate Internet cables — rough weather was reported in that part of the Gulf.

The unusual cuts led to disruptions in services, slowed down businesses and hampered personal Internet usage. They also caused a flurry of Internet blogger speculation, including mentions of sabotage — allegations authorities and FLAG have refused to comment.

""It is difficult to comment right now on this,"" said a FLAG spokesman, reached over the telephone. ""We are doing our own investigation."" He spoke on condition of anonymity, in line with company policy.

Ovum analyst Matt Walker said undersea cable networks are highly vulnerable to deliberate attack and need enhanced security.

""If ports, railways, gas pipelines, and other types of networks are being secured against possible sabotage, we must similarly increase the security of undersea optical highways,"" said Walker.

The cuts also underlined potential threats that disrupted Internet connectivity could pose to organizations and businesses worldwide. Large-scale Internet disruptions are rare, but East Asia suffered nearly two months of outages and slow service after an earthquake damaged undersea cables near Taiwan in December 2006.

""The economic cost of losing, or even just slowing down, international communications is extremely high,"" said Walker. ""This risk has to be factored into the calculations behind the investment level and design of undersea optical networks.""

FLAG said it has fully restored circuits to some customers and switched others to alternative routes.

The FLAG repair ship is trying to reconnect the Persian Gulf cable and repairs are expected to be done by Sunday. Weather conditions have improved and are now moderate, FLAG said.

Meanwhile, a second flag repair ship continued repair work off the north coast of Egypt, where the first undersea cable was cut Jan. 30, some 5.2 miles from the Egyptian port city of Alexandria.

That cut sliced two cables — the FLAG Europe-Asia cable, owned by FLAG, which stands for Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe, and another cable lying next to it, identified as SEA-ME-WE 4, or South East Asia-Middle East-West Europe 4 cable, owned by a consortium of 16 international telecommunication companies.

It was still not known what caused that cut, on a very narrow route linking Egypt and Palermo, on the Italian island of Sicily. Egypt's telecommunication ministry said no ships were registered near the location when the cut happened north of Alexandria.

FLAG, in a statement posted on the company Web site, said it had completed a survey of the cable cut off Egypt that involved ""tracking along the cable path and checking for cuts using remotely operated"" submarine robots.

The results of the survey were not revealed, but FLAG added these repairs would also be completed Sunday.

Earlier, the FLAG spokesman said that a new undersea cable — the FLAG Mediterranean Cable — was being laid between Egypt and France, that would be ""fully resilient"" against cuts such as last week's and ""provide a diversity in routes."" He did not elaborate what that resilience entailed, but said it would take months to set up the new cable.

Also, state Telecom Egypt said it sealed a $125 million contract on Jan. 31 with French-American telecommunications equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent, for a new 1,900 miles long undersea cable between Egypt and France.

That submarine cable, named TE North, will link Sidi Kerir on Egypt's northern coast to the French port of Marseille.

It will have multiple times the bandwidth capacity of existing cables and enable Telecom Egypt to ""expand international connectivity, providing diversity from existing cable routes."" Egyptian media have said that the new Telecom cable would take over 18 months to complete.","The article titled 'Ship's anchor caused cut in Internet cable' provides a detailed account of incidents involving undersea cables being cut.

2016.12.15 日本NEC（日本電氣株式會社）宣布，已完成大容量光纖海底電纜，未來亞洲連網速度將變更快。 圖：新頭殼資料照片  

美國「國家利益」雜誌刊文指出，海底電纜是台灣致命弱點，若遭中國大陸攻擊，將擾亂國際商業和金融市場，對日本、新加坡、印尼和澳洲造成嚴重經濟影響。  

前國防部副部長林中斌特別助理黃引珊在「國家利益」（The National Interest）撰文表示，雖然海底電纜是支撐今日全球數據和語音通訊最關鍵的基礎設施，它們也出奇地脆弱。  

她指出，若台灣海峽發生衝突，海底電纜將成為中國主要攻擊目標，切斷電纜將癱瘓台灣的國際通訊，且損害範圍將不僅限於台灣。  

在台灣與亞太國家間，至少有10條國際海底電纜。攻擊台灣的電纜將擾亂國際商業和金融市場，對日本、新加坡、印尼和澳洲等區域國家造成嚴重經濟影響。  

長期以來，中國的電纜策略對美國、台灣和亞太地區具有嚴肅的安全含意。  

中國正在建設的「海底長城」包括許多海底感測器，連接光纜到位於上海的中央處理與監控設施，將構成中國在南海海底觀測系統無可取代的一部分，可削弱美國在南海的海底軍事優勢。  

2016年9月以來，中國電信集團以4G光纖電纜站，取代位於南沙群島永暑礁、渚碧礁和美濟礁的衛星站。光纖電纜傳輸速度遠較衛星系統快速及穩定。  

這項建設在海牙仲裁法庭一致做出，對中國在南海領土聲索不利的判決僅2個月後展開。這些光纖電纜站大幅強化中國對南海管轄和控制能力。  

文章指出，美國和亞太盟邦應監控電纜線路安全，運用自動辨識系統精準定位損壞位置，也應建立多邊合作機制，以避免電纜維修延誤。

An additional third cable is down in the same region.

The cuts are causing traffic to be re-routed through the United States and elsewhere.

Egypt's communications ministry tells the Associated Press that the outage has almost completely killed internet services throughout Egypt.

A second report indicates that the three cables that are out include the SEA-ME-WE 4 cable (also known as SMW4), which went out at 7:28 a.m. local time Friday morning; SEA-ME-WE 3, which went down at 7:33 a.m.; and the FLAG EA cable, which went out at 8:06 a.m. The cables were cut in the region where they run under the sea between Egypt and Italy. They carry an estimated 90 percent of all data traffic between Europe and the Middle East. SMW 3 and SMW 4 are owned by groups of phone companies; FLAG is owned by Reliance Globalcom.

The SMW 4 and FLAG cables were among five undersea cables damaged earlier this year in January and February in the Mediterranean, launching a flurry of conspiracy theories before investigations revealed that at least one of the cuts was caused by a ship's anchor. When those cables went down, SMW 3 was used to re-route traffic. But this time, SMW 3 is reportedly involved in the outage as well.

A France Telecom report listed 14 countries affected by the current problem. The Maldives are 100 percent down, followed by India, which has 82 percent disruption. Qatar, Djibouti and the United Arab Emirates were the next most widely affected areas with about 70 percent service interrupted. Disruptions for Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Pakistan range from 51 percent to 55 percent.

UPDATE: As reader Julian Borg Barthet notes in the comments section, a fourth undersea cable went out Thursday evening in the same region. The cable, the Seabone, is operated by GO and runs between Malta and Sicily. According to the Times of Malta, GO transferred traffic to a second cable operated by Vodafone. It was the second time in four months that the Seabone cable had failed.","The article titled ""Undersea Cables Cut; 14 Countries Lose Web"" provides a comprehensive overview of recent incidents involving the cutting of undersea cables.

"Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda Internet Outage: Addressing Africa's Vulnerability","Significant internet outages in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda due to two undersea cables cut off South Africa; expert insights on increasing cable damage frequency and reliance on limited infrastructure.","https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjr77zj8lj4o","","Jewel Kiriungi",Yes,"Jewel Kiriungi","London, England","6000000","2024-05-14","English","BBC","**Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda internet outage: Africa's vulnerability and how to fix it**

A severe internet outage that has hit several African countries - the third disruption in four months - is a stark reminder of how vulnerable the service is on the continent.

Questions are being asked about how the reliability of what has become an essential tool in nearly every aspect of life can be improved.

A cut to two of the undersea cables, which carry the data around the continent, early on Sunday morning, led to the recent disruption.

In March, damage to four cables off the West African coast caused similar problems. And in February, the vital links were damaged in the Red Sea after the anchor of a stricken ship dragged through three cables.

Investigations are under way into this weekend’s case. But it was also likely to have been caused by “an anchor drag” from a ship, Prenesh Padayachee, chief digital and operations officer at Seacom, which owns one of the two cables affected, told the BBC. The second cable, known as Eassy, was affected at the same time and at the same place.

The incident happened off the South African coast, just north of the port city of Durban, according to the Communications Authority of Kenya (CAK).

The capacity of the infrastructure connecting Africa to the rest of the world has improved in recent years and telecoms companies are switching to other cables to maintain the service.

In Kenya, for example, the CAK said that local internet traffic was currently using The East Africa Marine System (Teams) cable that was not affected. While Kenya has alternatives, other countries, such as Tanzania where connectivity levels hit 30% of what they were expected to be, do not.

The data should be able to find other routes, but when there is a limited number of pathways the service gets jammed and slows down.

Cases of cable damage are increasing but that is because the number of connections has also gone up.

“A lot of people don’t realise that the internet is held up by these cables that are like garden hosepipes except it’s one that stretches 10,000km, and that means that they are quite fragile,” Dr Jess Auerbach Jahajeeah, a researcher into digital connectivity at the University of Cape Town, told the BBC’s Focus on Africa programme.

Anchor dragging from ships close to shore is one of the most common causes of damage, but underwater rockfalls, as was believed to be the case in West Africa in March, and seismic activity can also affect the cables.

As “many of these subsea cables are often quite close to each other, then one activity on the ocean floor or one ship can damage multiple cables at the same time”, industry expert Ben Roberts said.

Repairing the damage, which requires specialised equipment and expertise, can take days or weeks, depending on the weather, sea conditions and the extent of the problem.

It took more than a month, for example, for the four severed West African internet cables to be repaired and returned to service.

“We are working on a temporary capacity solution to ensure connectivity is reinstated to the affected regions,” said Mr Padayachee from Seacom. He added that they were “actively collaborating with various parties to expedite the repair process”.

Cable repair ship the Léon Thévenin, that had been docked in Cape Town, is being sent to the site of the damage and should be there in three days, said Chris Wood, who runs a company that has invested in Eassy.

Despite an increase in connections, Africa's reliance on a limited number of undersea cables for the internet makes the continent more susceptible to disruptions and exacerbates their impact. Europe and North America, on the other hand, have a dense network of high-capacity overland and undersea cables that diversify connectivity routes and improve resilience.

While discussions have been ongoing to address Africa's internet infrastructure challenges, progress has been slow because of logistical and financial constraints.

Dr Jahajeeah said one problem was that the support systems to repair the growing number of cables around the continent had not kept up with the growth. While other ships can help out, the Léon Thévenin is the only repair ship dedicated to servicing Africa.

“The [ship] used to do two or three repairs a year [but] last year it did nine… and there is a real need for African governments and global governments to get together and say we need to ensure that there is no digital divide,” Dr Jahajeeah said.

Some people have proposed alternatives such as satellite internet links to bolster digital resilience. Elon Musk's Starlink project, for example, aims to provide high-speed internet to people who live in remote areas via a network of satellites. But is very expensive and currently not available everywhere.

The answer really lies in greater investment on the ground to support the vital communications infrastructure.

“It needs more networks, more connectivity, more data centres and more internet exchanges to make sure that we have a diverse connectivity,” said Mr Roberts.

"Sharks and Ships: The Threat to Undersea Fiber Optic Cables","Explores shark bites and human activities causing outages in undersea cables, affecting global internet connectivity.","https://californiadiver.com/slow-internet-sharks-ships-have-an-appetite-for-undersea-fiber-optic-cables","","",Yes,"Charles Halter","Larkspur, California, United States","10000","2015-11-03","English","California Diver Magazine","With thousands of satellites in orbit communicating with us at the speed of light, 99% percent of international data is transmitted by cables crisscrossing the bottom of our oceans. In total, there are hundreds of thousands of miles of both copper and fiber-optic cables currently on the ocean floor. While transmitting information via satellite may seem much easier and more reliable than undersea cables, fiber optic cables deliver information at a much lower cost than our most advanced satellites today.

In shallow waters, voice and data transmission cables are buried beneath the ocean floor using high pressure water jets to dig trenches. In deeper water, where the environment is more stable, they are typically laid on top of the ocean floor, with care taken to avoid coral reefs, sunken ships, and other potentially damaging obstructions. There is one underwater hazard that wasn’t originally seen as a danger to underwater communications but has proven to cause millions of dollars in damage to undersea fiber optic lines – sharks.

Reports of sharks biting undersea cables date back to 1987. It was then that the New York Times reported that ""sharks have shown an inexplicable taste for the new fiber-optic cables that are being strung along the ocean floor linking the United States, Europe, and Japan.""

AT&T also encountered problems after they laid a trial optical cable, TAT-8, in the Canary Islands in 1983. This cable did not have an electrical screen and was attacked by sharks. It was never proved whether these attacks were due to the sharks sensing the electrical radiation from the cable or the vibration of the cable moving on the sea floor where it might have been suspended. TAT-8 did have the screen conductor because of the possible effect of shark attacks. Because the cable was the first fiber optic cable and not coaxial cable, the electrical interference shielding for the high voltage supply lines was removed. This removal did not affect the fiber, but it did cause feeding frenzies in sharks that swam nearby. The sharks would then attack the cable until the voltage lines killed them. This caused numerous, prolonged outages. Eventually, a shark shielding was developed for the cable. PTAT-1, the next cable to go in the Atlantic was put in with the shark shielding and it proved much more reliable than TAT-8.

The first conclusive evidence of sharks’ attraction to fiber optic cables was found in 1985, when shark teeth were found embedded in an experimental data line off the Canary Islands. That same year, shark bites caused the failure of four segments of cable in the Atlantic ocean, raising curiosity as to why it may be happening.

The website oAfrica, which tracks digital news on the continent, theorized in 2009 that the emission of electricity from the fiber cables may attract the sharks, who mistake the currents for prey.

""Unlike short-haul terrestrial fiber cables or old copper cables where the fiber did not emit noticeable fields, undersea cables must carry high voltage power to the undersea repeaters, which result in both electric and magnetic fields around and along the cable … Some sharks mistake the electric fields for distressed fish and attempt to feed on the cable.""

Dr. Chris Lowe, one of the founders of the Shark Lab at California State University, Long Beach believes that sharks bite the cables for a different reason, and told Wired that sharks may just be curious about the cables. ""If you had just a piece of plastic out there shaped like a cable, there’s a good chance they’d bite that too,"" said Dr. Lowe in the interview.

Being curious creatures, it’s a theory that makes sense. And sharks have been seen biting buoy lines, anchor lines, tires, and just about anything else in their environment.

Whether through natural curiosity or in search of a meal, Google is attempting to prevent damage to their cables, and for good reason – they currently own over 100,000 miles of private fiber optic routes around the world, including 5,000 miles fiber-optic cables spanning the Pacific.

Dan Belcher, a product manager on the Google cloud team, said that Google goes to great lengths to protect its infrastructure, including wrapping its trans-Pacific underwater cables in Kevlar to prevent against shark attacks and other damage.

In South Africa, the results of the testing showed that the layers of 0.15 millimeter steel and a high density 0.05 millimeter polyethylene jacket protect that insulation from shark attack. Generally, sharks do not feed below 1,500m, so only cables shallower than this depth need extra reinforcement.

But are sharks really the threat they’re made out to be? The International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) doesn’t seem to think so, and it’s likely that once again, sharks aren’t the villains they’re made out to be.

""The International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) has reviewed records of cable faults worldwide, and together with an assessment of the video, conclude that much of the media hype was incorrect. Essentially, sharks and other fish were responsible for less than one percent of all cable faults up to 2006. Since then, no such cable faults have been recorded,"" the group said in a message.

The group also said that ""expert advice suggests the cable was attacked by a six-gill, blunt nose shark (Hexanchus griseus), which took one bite and swam away. The cable sustained no obvious external damage and is unlikely to have suffered internal damage.""

A look at the damages to undersea cables shows that most threats to cables, however, do not come from apex predators at all. 70 percent of undersea cable faults are caused by ship anchors and fishing trawlers that inadvertently snag a cable, with another 10-15 percent of damage from natural disasters like earthquakes, underwater landslides, or tidal currents dragging lines underwater. Most undersea data connections have redundancy built into them to help avoid outages, however even the most minor repairs can cost millions of dollars and result in network slowdowns.

The court heard the cables carry data from some of the largest financial firms, telecommunications firms and cloud operators. One cable carries information key to traders on the global stock markets.

The companies claim the owners of several fishing vessels have been trawling in the waters near the cables, allegedly posing a high risk of damage to the cables.

The companies claim the defendants’ actions also place the trawler crews in danger as the cables are charged and there is a history of vessels sinking having had their fishing equipment caught in subsea cables. The cable owners seek various orders against Brendan, Denis, James and John O’Flaherty, as alleged registered owners of several fishing vessels operating out of Kilmore Quay in Co Wexford.

The orders sought include an injunction restraining them trawling, dropping anchor or interfering with the seabed within 1km of the cables until the full dispute has been determined.

The applicants claim the cables at risk from the fishermen’s alleged actions are the “segment D cable” which runs from Sutton, Dublin, via the Irish Sea, before making its way west to Halifax, in Nova Scotia, Canada.

The defendants oppose the applications and say there is no basis in law that would allow a court make such orders. The orders would prevent them from engaging in lawful fishing activities, they say. Another cable allegedly at risk is the Hibernia express cable, which runs between Brean in the UK, lands in Co Cork, before running on to Halifax. Ciaran Lewis SC, for the companies, said the matter was urgent.

His clients, following a number of incidents had asked the defendants to cease fishing near the cables, but they had failed to do so. The cables, he said, are extremely expensive to repair when damaged and varied from €600,000 to €1.4 million for every repair.

Darren Lehane SC, for the fishermen, said they are currently out at sea and he was not in a position to give any undertakings to the court until they were able to speak with them. The matter is complex and should be heard by the judge designated to hear admiralty matters, he said.

Ms Justice Leonie Reynolds acknowledged the urgency of the matter given the serious claims made in relation to health and safety. She said the matter could not be heard until after the Easter holidays. She adjourned it to later this week with a view to fixing a hearing date for the dispute.","The article discusses legal actions taken by undersea cable owners against fishermen trawling near their cables, highlighting risks of damage to the cables and the history of incidents involving fishing equipment getting caught.

**Published Date:** last Monday at 9:41 AM  

After Taiwan detained a Chinese-crewed vessel for severing an undersea telecommunications cable off the island in late February 2025, social media users misleadingly claimed President Lai Ching-te ordered the military to respond by firing into an area where other Chinese-owned ships have lingered. While the Taiwanese navy planned to hold drills nearby, it said they would not include the firing of live rounds -- and Lai had not given any order to attack the area as of March 24.

""The government has taken a tough stance! The national army defends Taiwan's sovereignty, preventing anyone from invading our waters and casually cutting our undersea cables,"" reads the traditional Chinese caption of an image shared on on March 9, 2025. The image, which shows Lai delivering a speech, is superimposed with text that reads, ""Chinese ships frequently cut Taiwan's undersea cables. Lai Ching-te's government now orders the national army to shoot at the area where Chinese ships linger"".

The same image also circulated in posts on X, Threads and YouTube. The claim spread after Taiwan's coast guard detained the Togolese-registered ship Hongtai and its Chinese captain for severing an undersea telecoms cable serving the Penghu island group in the sensitive Taiwan Strait.

The coast guard said the Hongtai was among 52 ""suspicious"" Chinese-owned ships flying flags of convenience from Mongolia, Cameroon, Tanzania, Togo and Sierra Leone highlighted for close monitoring. Vessels suspected of loitering or anchoring near subsea cables will be warned by radio to leave the area, and boarding inspections will be conducted when needed.

Taipei fears Beijing -- which claims the self-ruled island as part of its territory and has threatened to use force to bring it under its control -- could sever its communication links as part of an attempt to seize or blockade the island.

While Taiwan's defence ministry issued notice of a planned drill to the southeast of the Penghu island group on March 24, and warned fisherman to avoid the area for their own safety, the ministry told the state-run Central News Agency (CNA) that ""no live-free shooting will be carried out in the sea and air exercise area"".

A keyword search on website of the Taiwan president's office also found no order to open fire in the area where the Chinese ships had reportedly lingered. A reverse image search on Google found the photo of Lai used in the false posts predates the detention of the Hongtai, and has circulated in CNA reports since March 2023.

CNA told AFP in a March 20 email that the image is one of the agency's archived.

""These cables are carrying thousands of volts of power,"" Mark Simpson, CEO of SEACOM, told Wired. The company owns five undersea fiber optic lines running from South and East Africa to Asia and Europe. Attempting to cut such a line could easily kill you, he said, making sabotage ""pretty unusual and pretty dangerous.""

That's not to say it didn't happen, and so far, it's one of the explanations the Egyptian military has offered in the five days since naval forces arrested three men alleged to have attempted to cut an undersea cable off the coast of Alexandria. The head of Egypt Telecom said the incident caused a 60 percent drop in internet speeds.

The men have insisted they cut the cable by mistake. Egyptian officials haven't offered any further details on what exactly happened to the South East Asia-Middle East-West Europe 4 (SEA-ME-WE 4 for short) cable beyond saying the military stopped a ""criminal operation.""

Regardless of what exactly happened, the incident underscores the vulnerability of the world's undersea communications cables to damage, intentional or not. Nearly 200 undersea fiber optic cables link the world's telecommunications, and they are for the most part poorly armored, rarely patrolled and only occasionally monitored.

Telecommunications market research firm TeleGeography recently released an intricate map that traces the routes these cables follow. When a major cable breaks (or gets cut), it can severely slow down internet connection speeds and even put countries completely in the dark. A cut cable off the coast of Alexandria in 2008 left Egypt, India, Pakistan and Kuwait in the dark. A 2006 earthquake in Taiwan damaged several cables and cut off communication to Hong Kong, South East Asia and China.

There has been some suggestion that the guys in Alexandria were treasure hunters who thought the cable might contain copper, Simpson said. It wouldn't be the first time someone cut a line trying to strike it rich. Two years ago, a Georgian woman struck a fiber optic cable while digging for copper, cutting off internet access to neighboring Armenia for five hours.

Historically, however, undersea cables are more susceptible to accidental breakage by ship anchors, fish trawlers and natural disasters. Tim Stronge, a researcher at Telegeography, says such mishaps snap cables about 100 times a year. Some countries try to prevent breakages by providing detailed nautical maps and levying heavy fines for dropping anchor or casting nets in close proximity to cables.

""The industry is accustomed to cables breaking,"" Stronge said. ""They are armored when they are close to shore and generally they are buried slightly under the sea floor closer to the beach.""

A single submarine cable is anywhere from 0.75 to 2.5 inches thick. The armored cables closer to shore can have up to two layers of galvanized wires protecting the fiber optic core. These aren't the kind of cables you cut with a pair of wire cutters.

That said, nothing is impossible, which is why it is somewhat surprising that there is little security in place to protect these vital cables from sabotage or terrorism.

""Other than obscurity and a few feet of sand, [the cables] are just there,"" Andrew Blum, author of Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet, told Wired. ""The staff at a cable landing station might patrol the path to the beach landing once or twice a day, but otherwise I've never heard of or seen any constant security.""

A lack of security can leave cables vulnerable to attack. Some telecoms and governments use radar tracking systems to monitor the area around these cables. Such technology detects when a ship is getting dangerously close to a cable and can warn the vessel of its proximity. But Blum says this high level of awareness can be ""a boon to saboteurs"" seeking the exact location of certain cables.

In places like Egypt, undersea cables are especially vulnerable because there is a bottleneck of 14 cables coming out of both Alexandria and Cairo. Eight of them connect to the shores of Alexandria. Cutting cables in this area would have a domino effect that would hurt connectivity in many countries. ""What's true for shipping is true for the internet,"" Blum noted.

Cutting these cables would effectively slow down internet speeds in more than just Egypt. A ship anchor recently damaged six cables off the coast of Alexandria in February and led to outages in several East African countries. With so much of the continent's connectivity tied to such a small area, it would make it an appealing target for would-be saboteurs.

That said, terrorist attacks and intentional cable cuttings are rare. Stronge has not heard of another case like that alleged to have happened in Egypt, and said whatever happened remains a matter of speculation.

""As far as I know, it hasn't been proven that these men were cutting cables,"" Stronge said. ""It could be a case of these men being in the wrong place at the wrong time. It could be Egyptian authorities being nervous about internet outages.""

Stronge said that his biggest fear is that this incident become undersea cable folklore, much like that old saw about sharks biting through the first submarine fiber optic cable.

""You still hear that today,"" he said. ""What really happened was the cable was mislaid and it was too taut between the mountains and valleys of the ocean floor. It had nothing to do with sharks. I worry that people will now just assume that there are saboteurs across the coast of Alexandria.","The article discusses various aspects of undersea internet cable vulnerabilities, including direct mentions of incidents where cables were cut or damaged.

It highlights a specific case of alleged sabotage off the coast of Alexandria, the consequences of cable damage on internet connectivity, and the general susceptibility of undersea cables to both intentional and accidental disruptions.

This aligns well with the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables."

Denne gang på to datakabler mellem Sverige og Finland. Denne gang er bruddet dog sket på land i Finland.

Det ene kabel (C-Lion1), der går mellem Helsinki og Hanko i Finland og Rostock i Tyskland, blev beskadiget 700 km fra Helsinki ud for den svenske ø Øland. Det andet (BCS East-West Interlink) går mellem Sverige og Litauen.

"NATO Enhances Undersea Cable Infrastructure Amid Russian Threats","NATO is investing in undersea cable security to counteract potential Russian sabotage, addressing vulnerabilities that could disrupt global communications.","https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/06/24/nato-undersea-cable-network-russia-infrastructure-defense","2024-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","Jack Detsch; Keith Johnson",Yes,"Jack Detsch; Keith Johnson","Washington, D.C., United States","2400000","2024-06-24","English","Foreign Policy","There are just two cables linking the remote Arctic archipelago of Svalbard with mainland Norway, providing almost all the data from polar-orbiting satellites to the rest of the world. And two years ago, they nearly stopped working.

Norwegian police images released in late May show the catastrophic damage done to one of the Svalbard fiber optic cables: the plastic casing slashed open, the cable exposed, and wires unfurled like a faulty electrical cord.

The unsolved January 2022 incident, which cut data flow from the SvalSat satellites and limited air traffic to the archipelago, is serving as a cautionary tale about what can happen when undersea cables—which underpin most of the global communications network—are cut. Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels did just that earlier this year when they targeted a key bottleneck between Asia, Africa, and Europe—after threatening to do so in response to Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza.

The threat is not just limited to one or two areas. NATO officials believe that Russia has a decadeslong program to map out European undersea infrastructure as part of an effort to prepare the battlefield for a possible conflict with the 32-nation alliance.

“We know the potential is there to do damage if they would want to,” said a senior NATO official, speaking with Foreign Policy on condition of anonymity based on ground rules for interacting with journalists set by the alliance. “Part of Russian war planning is knowing where the critical infrastructure of your enemy is.”

It doesn’t take a huge effort by the Russians to get the information that they need to cause harm. Most of the pipelines are run by utility companies, and much of the data on where the cables run is in the public domain because of licensing requirements.

In response, NATO now has an undersea infrastructure coordination group that brings together military and civilian officials and has the power to convene top representatives from the private sector, based out of the alliance’s Maritime Command in the London suburb of Northwood.

“The question is connecting all the dots and creating a network,” the senior NATO official said of the information and intelligence exchange.

The ambitious effort is an attempt to use computing power to protect the vast undersea cable network that undergirds much of the global economy. Since it’s nearly impossible to patrol undersea all the time without an unrealistic number of submarines—especially across the Atlantic Ocean—the alliance has to rely on computers. Drawing on data from software interfaces and the cable and pipeline operators themselves, NATO allies are working together with the private sector to create a massive alert system for the thousands of miles of undersea infrastructure in Northern Europe, relying on sensors from the cables as well as acoustic sensors attached to wind turbines, which can be used to detect irregularities.

“NATO processes, I think, are sort of in a very early phase,” said Audun Halvorsen, the director of the emergency department for the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association (and formerly the country’s deputy foreign minister). “They are basically trying to map out the landscape when it comes to jurisdictions, when it comes to authorities involved. You are facing a huge range of different regulatory regimes for the industry around the undersea basin.”

The strategy of cutting undersea cables is almost as old as modern warfare. (The first trans-Atlantic cables had been laid a few decades earlier, in 1866.) Britain began cutting German undersea cables at the outset of World War I to sabotage communications—and the Germans happily returned the favor. When submarine telephone cables began being laid in the 1950s, during the early days of the Cold War, Soviet trawlers damaged underwater cables near the Newfoundland coast. The U.S. Navy alone owns more than 40,000 nautical miles of active cables on the seafloor.

But with fiber optic cables becoming the ubiquitous plumbing that underpins global communications and trade in the internet age, the vulnerability in the seabed is growing. Norway’s undersea pipeline network provides about 40 percent of Europe’s natural gas supply, with pipelines crisscrossing the North Sea to the United Kingdom and the rest of the continent along with about 500 underwater communication cables that carry roughly 97 percent of the world’s internet traffic—some of them extending all the way across the Atlantic Ocean. That’s as much as $10 trillion in financial transactions every day.

“It is less kinetic and more a way for the Russians to show the West that ‘we know you guys are quite challenged in securing that infrastructure,’” said Sebastian Bruns, a naval expert at the Center for Maritime Strategy and Security at the Institute for Security Policy at Kiel University in Germany. “They would be tackling the very seams of what ties our societies together.”

About 100 of those cables break globally every year—most by accident—and it’s basically impossible to protect all of that infrastructure, other than by adding even more redundant data cables or ensuring that more liquified natural gas tankers are waiting out at sea, providing another source of gas if there’s a break.

The concern for that infrastructure has led to the NATO effort, which began after the September 2022 attacks on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines that transport natural gas from Russia to Germany. Even though much of the data about where the cables are located is public, the sensor data that could determine whether a linkage is in danger of being cut is stovepiped far under the national level—meaning that it’s kept within the companies themselves. The United States alone has 85 licensed undersea telecommunications landing stations. And while many pipeline owners have taken into account the risk of corrosion and possible accidents, factoring for sabotage is less common.

Some experts believe that smaller groups of countries can move faster than NATO to protect the cables. In April, Norway and five other countries bordering the North Sea—Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, and the United Kingdom—agreed to share operational information to protect undersea cables and pipelines against sabotage. And the Council of the Baltic States recently met in Finland to condemn Russia’s hybrid tactics—incidents of sabotage that fall beneath the level of declared war, including threats to undersea cables.

Already, Russia is lashing out at Nordic countries through other means. Since Finland joined NATO in April 2023, Russia has been sending waves of forced migrants to their 830-mile-long shared border—nearly half of the entire boundary between Russia and the alliance—forcing Helsinki to shut down all of its crossings. Russia has proposed redrawing borders in the Baltic Sea, hit Sweden with cyberattacks, and even removed buoys on the Narva River that Estonia put in place to mark their maritime frontier.

“All of our economy under the sea is under threat,” Vice-Adm. Didier Maleterre, the deputy commander of the NATO maritime command, said in April.

The threat is heightened by a Russian submarine program that has resurged since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, operating from the Kola Peninsula. But problems can also be caused by unintended anchor drag from commercial ships. The Hong Kong-flagged and Chinese-operated NewNew Polar Bear, suspected of damaging the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia in October 2023, sailed away along the Northern Sea route with protection from a Russian icebreaker.

"Huthi Allegations on Undersea Internet Cable Cuts","Significant disruption in data traffic due to the Asia-Africa-Europe-1 cable cuts, with implications for shipping routes and allegations against the Huthi militia.","https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/huthis-rubymar-israel-seekabel-rotes-meer-1.6424326","","Ben Heubl, Hanno Charisius, Bernd Dörries",Yes,"Ben Heubl, Hanno Charisius, Bernd Dörries","Munich, Germany","127050","2024-03-05","German","Süddeutsche Zeitung","Mehr als 25 000 Kilometer ist es lang, etwa so dick wie ein Arm, und wohl um die 70 Kilogramm schwer, auf der Länge von einem Meter. Das Asia-Africa-Europe-1-Seekabel verbindet 19 Länder von Frankreich bis Hongkong mit rasend schnellem Internet, bis zu 40 Terabyte in der Sekunde. So war es zumindest die vergangenen knapp sieben Jahre. Mittlerweile ist der Datenverkehr im Asia-Africa-Europe 1 zum Erliegen gekommen, gekappt irgendwo im Roten Meer zwischen Jemen und Dschibuti. Etwa fünfzehn Kabel laufen hier von Asien nach Europa, vier davon sind nach Angaben des Netzbetreibers HGC aus Hongkong derzeit nicht mehr funktionstüchtig, was ein Viertel des Datenverkehrs in dieser Region betreffe.

Israelische Medien hatten schon seit einigen Tagen darüber berichtet, dass die Kabel im Roten Meer zerstört worden seien und spekuliert, die islamistische Huthi-Miliz könnte dahinterstecken. Die beschießt seit Monaten den Schiffsverkehr im Roten Meer, was schließlich dazu führte, dass nur noch etwa die Hälfte der Frachtschiffe die Route durch den Suezkanal fährt, die andere nimmt lieber den sicheren Umweg über das Kap der Guten Hoffnung vor Südafrika, der aber deutlich teuer und länger ist. Für die Huthi ist diese drastische Behinderung des Welthandels ein großer Erfolg. Ihre Begründung: Schiffe aus Ländern, die den Krieg gegen Gaza unterstützen, dürfen nicht mehr durch ihre Gewässer.

Die Huthi verfügen weder über Taucher noch U-Boote. In Wahrheit haben die Huthi bisher recht wahllos auf Frachtschiffe und Tanker gefeuert, sogar solche, die Waren für die eigene hungernde Bevölkerung an Bord haben. Große Teile der arabischen Welt feiern sie dennoch, als einzige Gruppe, die sich wirklich auf die Seite der Palästinenser schlägt.

Die Unterbrechung von wichtigen Internetverbindungen wäre ein weiterer großer Propagandaerfolg. Die international anerkannte Regierung Jemens, mit der sich die militanten Islamisten einen langen Bürgerkrieg lieferten, warnte bereits Anfang Februar davor, dass die Huthi Kabel kappen könnten. Die sprachen wenig später von dem bevorstehenden Einsatz einer ""Unterseewaffe"". Am 24. Februar kamen die ersten Meldungen über ein gekapptes Kabel. Die Puzzleteile schienen Sinn zu ergeben. Mindestens ein israelisches Medium machte sofort die Huthi verantwortlich.

Eine Frage aber blieb: Wie sollen die Huthi die Kabel erreicht haben, die vermutlich in mehreren Hundert Metern Tiefe liegen? Sie verfügen weder über Taucher noch U-Boote. Wahrscheinlicher erscheint Experten, dass die Unterseekabel durch einen Schiffsanker gekappt wurden. ""Unser Team hält es für plausibel, dass das Kabel durch das Ziehen des Ankers in Mitleidenschaft gezogen wurde, da in der Region viel Schiffsverkehr herrscht und der Meeresboden in vielen Teilen des Roten Meeres niedrig ist"", sagte ein Sprecher von Seacom, einem Unternehmen, das eines der Kabel betreibt. Aufklärung könne aber erst ein Reparaturschiff vor Ort bringen. Von der SZ analysierte Satellitenbilder zeigen, dass sich die Rubymar zu jenem Zeitpunkt dort befunden haben könnte, wo die Kabel vermutlich gekappt wurden.

Das unter der Flagge von Belize fahrende Schiff war am 18. Februar von einer Rakete der Huthi getroffen worden und ist mittlerweile gesunken, davor war es etwa 70 Kilometer führerlos durch die See gedriftet, da die Besatzung in Sicherheit gebracht worden war. Das Kappen der Kabel wäre aber nicht der einzige Schaden, der aus der Raketenattacke der Huthi resultierte. Denn mit der Rubymar sanken 20 000 Tonnen Dünger.

Die ökologischen Folgen der gesunkenen Düngerfracht abzuschätzen, ist auch für Fachleute nicht einfach, solange die Gegebenheiten vor Ort unklar sind. In welcher Tiefe liegt das Schiff? Wie schnell wird das Düngemittel freigesetzt und wie setzt es sich genau zusammen? Wie stark ist die Strömung? Wenn Düngemittel rasch in großer Menge ins Oberflächenwasser gelange, könne es regional zu einer Algenblüte kommen, sagt der Chemiker Hermann Bange vom Geomar-Helmholtz-Zentrum für Ozeanforschung in Kiel. Das Rote Meer sei generell eher nährstoffarm, sodass Algen an der Oberfläche vom Nährstoffschub profitieren und sich in der Folge wahrscheinlich schlagartig vermehren würden.

Ob das negative Folgen habe, hänge vor allem von den Arten ab, die sich dann durchsetzen, das lasse sich nicht vorhersagen. Wenn das Düngemittel hingegen langsam in die Tiefe gelangt, werde es sich wahrscheinlich durch die Strömung rasch verteilen, sodass es kaum zu einem spürbaren Effekt komme. Boran Kartal, Forschungsgruppenleiter am Max-Planck-Institut für marine Mikrobiologie in Bremen, geht davon aus, dass der Dünger nicht schlagartig freigesetzt wird und es demnach wahrscheinlich keine langfristigen Veränderungen des Ökosystems durch den Untergang der Rubymar geben werde. Die Folgen einer möglichen Blüte schädlicher Algen in der Region seien jedoch schwer abzuschätzen. ""In der nährstoffreichen Ostsee treten schädliche Algenblüten regelmäßig auf, im nährstoffarmen Roten Meer jedoch praktisch nie."" Je nach Verlauf der Blüte könnten die Fischbestände in der Region beeinträchtigt werden, zumindest vorübergehend.","The article titled ""Huthi sollen Internetkabel durchtrennt haben"" discusses the cutting of the Asia-Africa-Europe-1 undersea internet cable in the Red Sea, which has led to a significant disruption in data traffic.

*By Bob Wallace, Featured Writer*  
*Published Date: 04/19/2024*  

Is network resiliency able to reach beyond five nines and SLAs for enterprises seeking always-on services?  

Given recent headlines and discussion in the wake of undersea cable cuts in the Red Sea, the answer is still no for multinationals. The situation is best described as business interruption as usual.  

On Saturday, February 24, three different cables were reported to have suffered faults:  
These international systems connect far-apart states like South Africa, the United Kingdom, and China. The faults off the coast of Yemen need to be repaired. The work is tough to do in a narrow, heavily traveled shipping lane that doubles as a war zone with a concentration of submarine cables on the sea floor.  

Fighting in the Middle East is a concern as enterprises and the telecom industry rely on undersea cables to carry the bulk of their intercontinental traffic.  

Since late February, three more faults in the region have been reported, according to TeleGeography, a research firm that builds and maintains massive data sets that are used to monitor, forecast, and map the telecommunications industry. One report has a ship dragging an anchor as the culprit, which the firm claims is the second most frequent cause behind cuts/faults of these business and communications lifelines.  

The cause of the undersea cable disruption is still uncertain.  

Whodunnit? Since then, no open-source evidence has come out to support the claim that Houthis, part of a Yemen civil war, were responsible. ""But here's one thing we do know: accidents happen all the time,"" noted Tim Stronge, Research VP at TeleGeography, in a March 5 advisory. ""On average, two cables suffer faults somewhere in the world every week!""  

Suspicious activity or not? Stronge does not believe the three almost simultaneous cable faults are overly suspicious.  

Although the Red Sea cables carry 90% of Europe-Asia communications flow through them, operators have built a lot of redundancy into the network. The ability to reroute traffic is increasingly available.  

Tougher times ahead for undersea cable industry: Houthi attacks on ships make life tougher for the undersea cable industry, which could hurt enterprises.  

Items for governments to act on: Governments are the ones on the hook for the long-term security of subsea cables. The International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) has created a list of 16 action items.  

Flirting with disaster: Some government regulations (such as environmental protection) may unintentionally herd cables into narrow corridors.  

Seeking alternatives: When it comes to alternatives to undersea cables, the cupboard is bare. One approach is to install cables over alternative routes.

The outermost layer is peeled off. The reinforcement is broken.  
For the first time in public, NRK can reveal what the Svalbard cable looked like after it was damaged on the night of 7 January 2022.  
The tear enabled seawater to come into contact with a copper layer carrying electrical current in one of the two cables that together make up the Svalbard fiber. The current is used to amplify the fibre optic signals that flow through the 1300km long cables between the peninsula and the Norwegian mainland. Because of the breakage, the current went straight to ground, and the cable stopped working.  
It has not been previously established *how* the cable was damaged. Now, the photos might provide some clues.  
Initially, the police stated that they believed the damages were caused by human activity. Later on, the investigation was dropped, due to lack of evidence.  
**The unique photos from the police investigation are now published for the first time.**  
Several experts with extensive experience with submarine cables and installations have assessed the images for NRK. Their judgement is that the damage to the Svalbard fiber was due to the cables being crushed.  
One of them is a manager in one of the larger companies in Norway that owns and operates communication cables on the seabed. He does not want to be identified, out of concern for the safety of his company's seabed cables.  
«It looks like there is damage to the outer jacket of the cable. This can happen if an anchor or a trawl is dragged across it. What does not seem to be present in the pictures, is a clear break or sharp deformation of the reinforcement around the cable, which could happen if you get stuck on a cable with a trawl or an anchor».  
Over the years, he has seen a number of cable incidents. He says it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the damage based on photos alone, but notes that there are no signs of it having been hooked by a dragged anchor, for instance.  
«By that reasoning, one might say that the pictures show damage after scraping or pinching by an object that has passed over or along the cable. This could typically be a trawl door or something that is towed along the sea floor.»  
**Police prosecutor Ronny Jørgensen confirms that the police's technical report also identifies «pinching damage» as a possible cause of the malfunction.**  
**Heavy trawling in the area when the cable damage occurred**  
Periodically, there is significant trawling activity in the area where the cable was damaged. If a vessel happens to trawl across a section of the cable that is not sufficiently buried, it is conceivable that the , which weigh several tons, could pinch the cable against rocks or hard seabed.  
The Svalbard fibre is buried deep into the bottom sediments, ideally up to two meters. However, if the seabed is too hard, it may lie much more shallow, potentially at risk from bottom trawl activity.  
NRK has previously reported how [a Russian trawler crossed the Svalbard cable more than 140 times](https://www.nrk.no/nordland/xl/russiske-tralere-krysset-kabler-i-vesteralen-og-svalbard-for-brudd-1.16007084), and more than a dozen times before the damage occurred in January 2022. The shipowners have denied having anything to do with the damage.  
The police questioned the crew was questioned by the police, and used underwater drones to film the seabed in the surrounding area. A recording shared with NRK shows deep tracks on the seabed that might originate from a trawler door.  
**The vulnerability of seabed cables**  
The critically important cable that connects Svalbard to the mainland is no thicker than a pinkie finger. A steel wire reinforcement is spun around it for protection. The outermost layer is a nylon yarn inserted with tar.  
Cable damages occur many times each year, across the globe. This fiber link is one of many subsea cables worldwide that are crucial in their role to connect the world, but at the same time highly vulnerable.  
Where it might be possible to re-route traffic to another cable in well-connected parts of the underwater world, the incident outside in the remote Arctic peninsula revealed the fragility of the cable.  
The damage to this cable is also one of the first well-known incidents in recent years where experts are drawing a possible connection to Russian hybrid warfare at sea.  
**Compared to other cable damages**  
Since that January night in February 2022, several other cable incidents have received significant international attention.  
On October 8, 2023, both a communication cable and a gas pipeline running between Finland and Estonia were torn off.  
The cable break was investigated by Estonian authorities. They have concluded that the cable was torn off by a dragging anchor.  
«According to the main investigative version, the damage to the communications cables is connected to the vessel Newnew Polar Bear belonging to a Chinese company,» writes state attorney Triinu Olev in a statement to Estonian ERR and NRK.  
Many damages to cables also occur without it becoming known to the general public.  
«The typical damage we see on our marine fiber cables, is mechanical stress due to hooks from fishing. This probably accounts for more than 80 per cent of all damages we have seen. Not all damages have been possible to determine, but damage from bottom trawling and scallop fishing are the most common,» the technical director writes to NRK.

Around 150 to 200 fiber-optic cable breaks are recorded each year. Between 65% and 75% occur in water depths of < 200 m and result mainly from fishing and shipping activities. In contrast, breaks attributed to geohazards comprise < 10% of the world average. However, seaward of the busy continental shelf and upper continental slope, geohazards account for at least one-third of breaks.

This paper reports on a succession of cable-damaging events that disrupted a key part of the modern fiber-optic network off southernmost Taiwan. Information from this network provides further insights into the triggers, frequency, and behavior of sediment density flows, a general term applied here to cover various forms of sediment-laden currents, including hyperpycnal flows, debris flows, and turbidity currents.

Cable break is a generic term applied here to encompass any damage caused by external forces. For fiber-optic systems, the term break covers effects that alter a cable's performance, especially when multiple cables are damaged. In the case of a single break, the speed of the flow may be estimated if the flow source is known or assumed (e.g., an earthquake epicenter). 

This article provides statistical insights into the frequency of these breaks and their implications for communication networks, emphasizing the importance of understanding submarine geohazards in relation to subsea telecommunication cables.","The article 'Insights into Submarine Geohazards from Breaks in Subsea Telecommunication Cables' extensively discusses incidents involving fiber-optic cable breaks caused by various external forces, including geohazards.

**Stromausfall auf Bornholm: Alles ein blöder Zufall?**  
Rønne: Auf ganz Bornholm ist am Montagmorgen der Strom ausgefallen. (Archivbild)

Ein Blackout auf der Ferieninsel Bornholm wirft Fragen auf: War es Sabotage wie bei den in der Nähe gelegenen Nordstream-Gasleitungen? Die Insulaner selbst vermuten etwas anderes. Eine Untersuchung soll in den nächsten Tagen Klarheit bringen.

Seit den Nordstream-Lecks ist das dänische Bornholm in der Weltpresse präsent – quasi als Ortsmarke der europäischen Energiekrise. Vor den Küsten der Ostseeinsel verlaufen die sabotierten Gasröhren Nord Stream 1 und 2.

Deshalb machte es am Montag Schlagzeilen, dass der Strom auf Bornholm für einige Stunden komplett ausfiel. Die Insel misst 588 Quadratkilometer und ist damit etwa halb so groß wie die nächstgelegene deutsche Insel Rügen. Die Behörden teilten zunächst mit, ein Unterwasserkabel, das Strom aus Schweden liefere, sei gekappt worden. „Zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt gibt es keinen Grund, über die Ursache zu spekulieren“, schrieb der Versorger Trefor auf seiner Website. „Und wir sind dabei zu klären, was für den Stromausfall verantwortlich ist.“

Natürlich befeuerte diese Aussage eben genau das: Spekulationen. Wieder Sabotage, ein mutmaßlicher Anschlag – wie schon bei den Nordstream-Leitungen?

Die Bornholmer, das wird nach wenigen Anrufen klar, sind erpicht darauf, sich nicht weiter geopolitisch zu verstricken.

„Schreiben Sie nicht …“, sagt die Mitarbeiterin der Bibliothek am Telefon, „dass es …“, sie senkt die Stimme in ein ironisches Flüstern, „_die Russen_ waren.“ Der Ausfall hänge nicht mit dem aktuellen Konflikt zusammen, vermutet sie, sondern sei ein „blöder Zufall“. Denn es passiere häufiger mal, dass auf Bornholm der Strom ausfällt. Etwa weil ein Schiffsanker mit dem besagten Unterwasserkabel nach Schweden kollidiere. „Es gibt keinen Grund, panisch zu werden.""

**Letzter großer Stromausfall vor einem halben Jahr**  
Tatsächlich ist es erst etwas mehr als ein halbes Jahr her, dass auf Bornholm das Netz ausfiel – am 26. Februar, ebenfalls in den Morgenstunden. Damals lag es an dem Seekabel und einem Fehler im Hochspannungsnetz. Die Leitung verläuft auf dem Meeresboden zwischen dem Inselort Hasle und dem südschwedischen Borreby. Es verbindet das Bornholmer Stromnetz mit dem des Nachbarlandes; die Insel ist dem schwedischen Festland näher als dem dänischen. In der Vergangenheit führten immer wieder technische Fehler und heruntergelassene Schiffsanker dazu, dass die Stromverbindung nach Schweden unterbrochen wurde. Nur kümmerte das außer den Insulanern niemanden. In Zeiten der Energiekrise ist das anders.

**Verkehr läuft ohne Ampeln**  
Die Bornholmer, das ergibt zumindest die Stichprobe, waren nicht sonderlich beunruhigt über den jüngsten Blackout. Obwohl etwa Internet und Telefon wegfielen. Ein Hotelier berichtet, er sei per SMS über den Ausfall informiert worden. In ein paar Stunden würde der Strom wieder hergestellt sein, schrieb ihm der Versorger. Das Netz war morgens um 7.49 Uhr ausgefallen. Dem Versorger Trefor zufolge hing um 9.35 Uhr etwa ein Drittel der 40.000 Einwohnerinnen und Einwohner wieder am Strom, bis zum späten Vormittag sei die Versorgung wieder komplett gewesen.

Im Inselkrankenhaus mit 900 Betten sprang das Notstromaggregat an. Lebenserhaltende Maschinen seien zudem über einen Akkubetrieb gesichert gewesen, teilte die Sprecherin des Krankenhauses auf RND‑Anfrage mit. Es habe keine Gefahr für die Patienten bestanden. Die Facebook-Seite der Inselzeitung „Bornholms Tidende“ zeigt ein Video, wie der Straßenverkehr ohne Ampeln weiterrollt – sich selbst regulierend, scheinbar ohne Probleme.

**Seekabel soll nicht das Problem sein**  
Kenneth Nielsen, 38, Besitzer einer Pension, bemerkte den Stromausfall, als er morgens am Küchentisch auf die schwarze Zeitanzeige an seinem Ofen blickte. Dann testete er das Licht. „Vielleicht ist es das Seekabel – oder es sind die Russen“, sagt er. Schiebt aber gleich hinterher: „Nein, nur das Seekabel.""

Seinen sechs Gästen konnte er kein Frühstück servieren. Aber das sei kein Problem gewesen, man habe alles erklärt. Auch Nielsen sagt, dass Ausfälle eben hin und wieder vorkämen. Doch trotz aller dänischen Gelassenheit – die Nordstream-Lecks trieben die Bornholmer natürlich um: „Alle Leute sprechen darüber: Wer es war, was noch passieren könnte.""

Das liegt auch an der speziellen Verbindung Bornholms zu Russland und der ehemaligen Sowjetunion. Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg besetzte die sowjetische Armee die Insel für fast ein Jahr. Deshalb gibt es Befürchtungen, dass die Insel in den Konflikt gezogen werden könnte – zumindest als Teil der Kriegsrhetorik.

Am Montagnachmittag meldete der dänische Netzbetreiber Energinet, dass die Leitung zwischen Bornholm und Schweden wieder funktioniere – der Stromausfall sei auf einen lokalen Fehler auf der Insel zurückzuführen. 

Und der Versorger Trefor kündigte eine Untersuchung des Vorfalls an, mit Ergebnissen rechne man in den nächsten Tagen. Dann wissen die Bornholmer, ob es bloß ein weiterer Stromausfall war – oder ob ihre Insel zukünftig noch viel mehr Aufmerksamkeit bekommen wird.","The article titled ""Stromausfall auf Bornholm: eine Ferieninsel im Fokus der Energiekrise"" discusses a power outage on the island of Bornholm, which was attributed to a cut underwater cable that supplies electricity from Sweden.

The article elaborates on the implications of this incident, including speculation about sabotage in light of recent geopolitical tensions and previous similar outages caused by underwater cables.

The focus is primarily on the incident involving the underwater cable rather than just a brief mention, thus satisfying the criterion of being an article on the topic of cut sea cables."

15 декабря 2017  

**В Великобритании снова заявили, что российские подводные лодки угрожают безопасности страны. Эксперты считают, что Россия может воспользоваться уязвимостью оптоволоконных кабелей, проложенных по дну океана, чтобы навредить экономике и коммуникациям на островах. Насколько обоснованы эти опасения?**  

Начальник генерального штаба вооруженных сил Великобритании Стюарт Пич заявил, что военно-морской флот России представляет угрозу для стран Запада. По его словам, уничтожение или вывод из строя подводных кабелей нанесет моментальный и потенциально катастрофический удар по экономике стран НАТО.  

Это высказывание порождает два важных вопроса: насколько вероятно, что Россия это сделает? Что случится, если Россия - или кто угодно другой - сделает это?  

Британский исследовательский центр Policy Exchange представил исследование, согласно которому в мире существует около 213 независимых подводных кабельных систем. Протяженность подводных оптоволоконных кабелей во всем мире, по оценкам центра, составляет больше 900 тыс. километров.  

Несмотря на то, что технология передачи данных по оптоволокну сама по себе очень надежна, подводные кабели физически довольно хрупки.  

Эксперт по российской информационной войне из Чатэм-хауса Кир Джилс полагает, что эта угроза в принципе не нова.  

Страхи перед тем, что Россия намеренно перережет стратегически важные коммуникации, продолжают расти. Военное командование НАТО отмечает не только активизацию российских военно-морских сил под водой, но и возможное намерение использовать неконвенциональные средства ведения войны.  

Россия - не единственная держава, проявляющая интерес к подводным системам связи. Однако, как подчеркивает Кир Джилс, Россия - единственная страна, обладающая мощной программой, направленной на то, чтобы изолировать свои цели от информации.  

""Урок, который Россия вынесла из Крыма, состоит в том, что для получения контроля над средствами связи противника не нужно дорогостоящее кибервооружение... Всё, что вам нужно, это физический доступ к инфраструктуре связи и умение разбираться в телекоммуникациях.""","The article discusses the vulnerability of undersea optical fiber cables and the potential threats posed by Russian submarines.

Earthquakes can rip things up, as can fishing hooks. But now we know of a new threat: Shark attacks.

According to Network World, Google Product Manager Dan Belcher told folks at a Google marketing event in Boston last week that Google ensures its cable is sheathed in a Kevlar-like protective coating to keep the sharks from chomping through the line. Turns out this is standard operating procedure among undersea cable-layers, who must take a number of steps to keep aquatic life from harming (or being harmed by) data cables.

We asked Google about this, and if they have any idea why sharks would want to eat fibre optic cables, but they had nothing to say.

But apparently it's a thing, as you can see in the video below.

As Google expands its online empire, undersea cables are becoming an increasingly important part of the plan. The company has invested in two major undersea cables connecting the western US to Asia, and a third cable that extends Google's network within Asia. That's where the big data bottleneck is these days, and a lack of fibre connectivity can push up market prices for moving data between the two continents. That is unless, like Google, you have access to your very own cables.

We've long known squirrels are a major problem to anyone laying cable, but according to a report by the International Cable Protection Committee cable bites -- by sharks and other fish -- remain a surprisingly persistent problem. In the 1980s, a deep-ocean fibre optic cable was cut four times. Researchers blame crocodile sharks for those attacks after finding teeth in the cable.

The cable protection folks really have no idea why sharks bite cables either, although some suggest it may be due to ""electro magnetic fields from a suspended cable strumming in currents,"" they say in their report.

Sharks, like other animals, can detect magnetic fields -- and they have miniature volt sensors in their mouths that they use to detect prey and mates. But there's a simpler explanation, says Chris Lowe, the professor who runs California State University, Long Beach's, Shark Lab. They may simply be curious. ""If you had just a piece of plastic out there shaped like a cable, there's a good chance they'd bite that too."" But even an exploratory nibble is enough to cause some serious trouble. ""Just a little bite is enough to get through the jacket, damage the fibres and then you're screwed,"" Lowe says.

More recently, Level 3 Communications technicians did come across a three foot long shark in a trench near its fibre cable -- two miles inland -- in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Maybe it was looking for a bite.

This article originally appeared on Wired.com.","The article titled ""Sharks wage war on undersea internet cables"" discusses the impact of sharks on undersea cables, detailing incidents where sharks bite these cables, leading to cuts and damage.

It provides historical examples, such as a deep-ocean fibre optic cable being cut multiple times due to shark bites in the 1980s, and mentions expert opinions on why sharks might be attracted to these cables, including curiosity and the detection of electromagnetic fields.

Furthermore, the article explains the significance of undersea cables for internet connectivity, noting that damage to these cables can cause serious disruptions.

Overall, the article is centered around the topic of cut sea cables and their implications, thus satisfying the criterion."

Two lines, Asia-America Gateway (AAG) and Asia Pacific Gateway (APG), are completely offline at the moment, and the Asia Africa Europe 1 (AAE-1) line is seeing disruptions towards the Hong Kong hub, while the Intra Asia (IA) line cable is seeing problems near the Singapore hub.

This is the first time such incidents have happened at the same time, and even more unfortunately, during the Lunar New Year holiday.

Many internet users have complained of slow and unreliable internet connections in recent times, ISPs have said.

Stressing that this was an unfortunate ‘force majeure’, a representative from Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group (VNPT) said the provider was actively deploying measures to ensure international internet connections to its consumers, including sharing data loads between still available international lines, working with Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube, as well as optimising traffic on different cables.

Thanks to these efforts, platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube can still be accessed normally, while financial, banking, and insurance transactions can still be conducted.

Mobile data connections are also ensured, according to the VNPT representative.

However, it stressed that with breakages occurring on four out of five undersea cables, internet access would suffer, especially in ‘peak hours’ with activities that demand large data like online games or watching movies, etc.

The military-run provider Viettel similarly has devised re-routing plans to regulate traffic on the remaining sea cable and land cables, and buy additional emergency capacity to ensure the best service quality for customers.

Major domestic service providers are actively working with submarine cable systems and ship operators to determine the cause of the issues, the location of the incident and the repair plan, in the shortest time possible.

Other smaller providers like CMC and NetNam are also making moves to mitigate the incident’s consequences like pushing more traffic onto land cables via China and Cambodia.","The article discusses significant disruptions affecting four out of five submarine internet cables that connect Vietnam to the global internet.

"Three Red Sea Data Cables Cut Amid Houthi Attacks","Cutting of three undersea cables disrupts global communications; ongoing Houthi attacks escalate tensions in the vital waterway.","https://apnews.com/article/red-sea-undersea-cables-yemen-houthi-rebels-attacks-b53051f61a41bd6b357860bbf0b0860a","2024-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","By JON GAMBRELL",Yes,"Jon Gambrell","New York","15000","2024-03-04","English","AP News","DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Three cables under the Red Sea that provide global internet and telecommunications have been cut as the waterway remains a target of Yemen’s Houthi rebels, officials said Monday. Meanwhile, a Houthi missile attack set a ship ablaze in the Gulf of Aden, but caused no injuries.

What cut the lines remains unclear. There has been concern about the cables being targeted in the Houthi campaign, which the rebels describe as an effort to pressure Israel to end its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The Houthis have denied attacking the lines, however.

While global shipping has already been disrupted through the Red Sea, a crucial route for cargo and energy shipments from Asia and the Middle East to Europe, the sabotage of telecommunication lines could further escalate the monthslong crisis.

The cut lines include Asia-Africa-Europe 1, the Europe India Gateway, Seacom and TGN-Gulf, Hong Kong-based HGC Global Communications said. It described the cuts as affecting 25% of the traffic flowing through the Red Sea. It described the Red Sea route as crucial for data moving from Asia to Europe and said it had begun rerouting traffic.

HGC Global Communications described the Seacom-TGN-Gulf line as being two separate cables when it is actually one at the area of the cut, according to Tim Stronge, a subsea cable expert with TeleGeography, a Washington-based telecommunications market research company.

Responding to questions from The Associated Press, Seacom said that ""initial testing indicates the affected segment lies within Yemeni maritime jurisdictions in the Southern Red Sea."" It said it was rerouting the traffic that it was able to change, though some services were down.

Tata Communications, part of the Indian conglomerate and behind the Seacom-TGN-Gulf line, told AP that it ""initiated immediate and appropriate remedial actions"" after the line was cut.

""We invest in various cable consortiums to increase our diversity and hence in such situations of a cable cut or snag, we are able to automatically reroute our services,"" Tata said.

Other firms behind those lines, which provide data to Africa, Asia and the Middle East, didn’t respond to AP’s queries.

In early February, Yemen’s internationally recognized government in exile alleged that the Houthis planned to attack the cables. The lines appeared to have been cut on Feb. 24, with the organization NetBlocks noticing internet access in the East African nation of Djibouti suffering from interruptions two days later. Seacom serves Djibouti.

But for their part, the Houthis have denied targeting the cables. The rebels blamed the disruptions on British and U.S. military operations, but didn’t offer evidence to support the allegation and have made false claims in the past.

Since November, the rebels have repeatedly targeted ships in the Red Sea and surrounding waters over the Israel-Hamas war. Those vessels have included at least one with cargo bound for Iran, the Houthis’ main benefactor, and an aid ship later bound for Houthi-controlled territory.

Despite more than a month and a half of U.S.-led airstrikes, Houthi rebels have remained capable of launching significant attacks. They include the attack last month on a cargo ship carrying fertilizer, the Rubymar, which sank on Saturday after drifting for several days, and the downing of an American drone worth tens of millions of dollars.

The Houthis insist their attacks will continue until Israel stops its combat operations in the Gaza Strip, which have enraged the wider Arab world and seen the Houthis gain international recognition.

Meanwhile, the British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center on Monday separately warned of a new attack in the Gulf of Aden. The private security firm Ambrey described the vessel targeted as a Liberia-flagged, Israel-affiliated container ship that sustained damage and issued a distress call.

""The container ship reportedly encountered two explosions of which the first occurred at a ‘distance’ off its port quarter, while the second damaged the vessel’s accommodation block and a container leading,"" Ambrey said. ""The explosion further led to a fire onboard and the crew’s firefighting efforts were underway.""

Ambrey and the UKMTO said no crew member on the ship had been injured in the blaze, which was extinguished several hours later.

Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesman, claimed the attack in a prerecorded statement. He identified the ship as the MSC Sky II, sailing for the Switzerland-based firm Mediterranean Shipping Co, but sought to link the vessel to Israel. The ship’s details and last-known location corresponded to details about the attack.

The Houthis ""will continue to prevent Israeli navigation or those heading to the ports of occupied Palestine until the aggression is stopped and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted,"" Saree said.

The U.S. military’s Central Command acknowledged the attack on the MSC Sky II and said the vessel ""did not request assistance and continued on its way."" The U.S. military separately conducted airstrikes on two anti-ship cruise missiles in Yemen.

MSC didn’t respond to questions about the attack.

It remains unclear how the Houthis could attack subsea cables themselves. The rebels aren’t known to have the diving or salvage capability to target the lines, which sit hundreds of meters below the surface of the waterway.

However, subsea cables can be cut by anchors, including those dropped from some of the ships that have been disabled in attacks. A drifting ship with its anchor scraping the sea could be the culprit.

""Our team thinks it is plausible that it could have been affected by anchor dragging, due to the amount of marine traffic the region deals with and the low seabed in many parts of the Red Sea,"" Seacom said. ""This can only be confirmed once the repair ship is on site.""

There are 14 cables now running through the Red Sea, with another six planned, said Stronge, the subsea cable expert.

""We estimate that over 90% of communications between Europe and Asia traverse submarine cables in the Red Sea,"" he said. ""Fortunately, telecom operators have built a high degree of redundancy into the system — there are many cables traversing the Red Sea.""

The Houthis later warned any cable-laying ship entering Yemeni waters needed a permit from the rebels ""out of concern for its safety.""","The article discusses the cutting of three undersea cables in the Red Sea, detailing specific incidents, the implications for global communications, and the context of the ongoing conflict involving the Houthi rebels.

A Chinese cargo ship has been stopped off the coast of Denmark. Officials are investigating the vessel for severing underwater telecommunications cables connecting a handful of northern European countries.  

The Danish navy has stopped a Chinese cargo ship off the coast of Denmark. Officials are investigating the vessel for severing underwater telecommunications cables connecting a handful of northern European countries. NPR's central Europe correspondent Rob Schmitz joins us now with the latest.  

This is a ship that was sailing from a Russian port on the Baltic Sea until it was stopped in the straits between Denmark and Sweden.  

This is a Chinese cargo vessel named the Yi Peng 3. After departing Russia, ship tracking data shows that on Sunday morning local time, this ship passed over a telecommunications cable that connects Sweden and Lithuania. Soon after crossing that point, that cable stopped working and was later found to be severed.  

Several hours later on early Monday morning, the same ship passed over an undersea communications cable connecting Finland and Germany, and 2 minutes later, that cable stopped working, and its operator noticed that the cable had also been severed.  

What's even more suspicious here is that ship tracking data shows the Yi Peng 3 had slowed down to a stop drifting in the general area over both undersea cables, in one case for more than an hour.  

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius stated, ""nobody believes these cables were accidentally cut. We have to assume without knowing for sure yet that this was an act of sabotage.""  

As for China's response, a foreign ministry spokesman stated that the government requires Chinese ships to adhere to relevant laws.  

The Danish navy says it stopped the Yi Peng 3 cargo ship, which is currently floating at a stop in the narrow straits between Denmark and Sweden.  

This incident occurs amid heightened tensions in Europe, with U.S. officials evacuating the American embassy in Kyiv and monitoring reports of Ukraine firing missiles into Russia.

Sharks have an undeserved reputation for being bloodthirsty killers that routinely make snacks out of tourists. Although the risk of getting eaten by a shark is extremely small, the same cannot be said for underwater fiber-optic cables that carry data around the world. It seems sharks have a mighty hankering for these vital intercontinental communication links – a penchant which has set Google on a mission to reinforce its trans-Pacific cables by wrapping them in a Kevlar-like material. Google product manager Dan Belcher revealed their shark-proofing efforts at a marketing meeting last week in Boston, reports.

#### An Appetite for Communication  
But why are sharks zeroing in on our global communication networks? Sharks have an uncanny ability to sense electromagnetic fields in the water using tiny detectors in their snouts called ampullae of Lorenzini. The organs, which look like freckles, sense even minute changes to electrical fields in the water, helping sharks find prey, navigate... or locate fiber-optic cables. ""No doubt the electromagnetic fields associated with these wires are highly attractive to these sharks,"" George Burgess, director of the Florida Program for Shark Research, told.

Underwater cameras caught this curious shark chomping on an underwater cable in 2010:

Interestingly, sharks don’t seem to be lured to the older copper cables that run underwater. It’s led to speculation that sharks confuse the high-voltage, magnetic emissions from fiber-optic cables with the signals given off by fish. Updated cables will thus likely protect the sharks and reduce energy-wasting attacks.

Sharks have been giving global communications companies headaches since the 1980s. According to the New York Times, a few shark teeth were found planted in a cable of the Canary Islands in 1985. Every year, more than 50 repairs are needed on undersea transcontinental communication lines due to damage from wildlife, fishing trawlers and earthquakes, reports. Google’s reinforced cables will be installed as part of a new $300 million system connecting the United States to Japan, according to a press release from project partner NEC. It will result in an Internet connection that relays information across the Pacific Ocean at 60 terabytes per second. That's good news for Internet users, but maybe the sharks have an ulterior motive: Perhaps they're simply fed up with fear-mongering documentaries that cast them in a negative light.

By Bob Wallace, Featured Writer  

Is network resiliency able to reach beyond five nines and SLAs for enterprises seeking always-on services?  

Given recent headlines and discussion in the wake of undersea cable cuts in the Red Sea, the answer is still no for multinationals. The situation is best described as business interruption as usual.

On Saturday, February 24, three different cables were reported to have suffered faults:  

These international systems connect far-apart states like South Africa, the United Kingdom, and China. The faults off the coast of Yemen need to be repaired. The work is tough to do in a narrow, heavily traveled shipping lane that doubles as a war zone with a concentration of submarine cables on the sea floor.

Fighting in the Middle East is a concern as enterprises and the telecom industry rely on undersea cables to carry the bulk of their intercontinental traffic.

Since late February, three more faults in the region have been reported, according to TeleGeography, a research firm that builds and maintains massive data sets that are used to monitor, forecast, and map the telecommunications industry. One report has a ship dragging an anchor as the culprit, which the firm claims is the second most frequent cause behind cuts/faults of these business and communications lifelines.

The cause of the undersea cable disruption is still uncertain. Whodunnit? Since then, no open-source evidence has come out to support the claim that Houthis, part of a Yemen civil war, were responsible. ""But here's one thing we do know: accidents happen all the time,"" noted Tim Stronge, Research VP at TeleGeography, in a March 5 advisory. ""On average, two cables suffer faults somewhere in the world every week!""

The research firm tracks 574 active and planned submarine cables as of early 2024.

Suspicious activity or not? Stronge does not believe the three almost simultaneous cable faults are overly suspicious. “Geological features or permitting issues have occasionally forced installers to lay different cables in close proximity to each other,” he explained. Such a situation increases the danger of a multi-cable fault.

In 2012, multiple cables suffered faults off the coast of Alexandria, Egypt. “Initial speculation blamed saboteurs, but many in the submarine cable industry now believe that a single ship dragging its anchor was the cause.”

Although the Red Sea cables carry 90% of Europe-Asia communications flow through them, operators have built a lot of redundancy into the network. The ability to reroute traffic is increasingly available.

There are fourteen cables already laid on the Red Sea. Even if three are down, eleven remain, wrote Stronge. “Data destined for damaged cables may be rerouted southward around the Cape of Good Hope or eastward through Asia and the United States.”

Houthi attacks on ships make life tougher for the undersea cable industry, which could hurt enterprises.  

* Vessels that are sinking or sunken present new underwater hazards to cables and cable ships. The cables typically lie on the ocean floor.  
* Combined, these two may make the installation of new cables in the Red Sea too prohibitive and make repair risky.

Governments are the ones on the hook for the long-term security of subsea cables. The International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) has created a list of 16 action items. ICPC membership comprises governmental administrations and commercial companies that own or operate submarine telecommunications or power cables, as well as other companies that have an interest in the submarine cable industry—including most of the world’s major cable system owners and cable ship operators.

One priority, which is a work in progress, is changing rules and regulations to open new seabed lanes and landing zones for cables. Having physically diverse zones provides options in locating where cables come ashore.

“Some government regulations (such as environmental protection) may unintentionally herd cables into narrow corridors,” explained Stronge. “As we’ve seen time and time again, a lack of physical diversity invites disaster.”

When it comes to alternatives to undersea cables, the cupboard is bare. Satellite connections are not fast or large enough to carry the traffic load on submarine pipes. 5G is not mature enough to help.

One approach is to install cables over alternative routes. As we reported in December, the SeaMeWe-6 cable project seeks to construct a cable that links Asia, the Middle East, and Europe via a route through India rather than the Red Sea. The article noted that the U.S. “snatched away” control of the project from China due to the importance of having alternative paths to send data.

"Tata Cable Cut Impact on Global SaaS Services","350 Gbit/sec capacity loss; over 30% packet loss in affected areas, causing significant latency increases for global SaaS services.","https://www.thousandeyes.com/blog/tata-cable-cut","","",Yes,"Nick Kephart","San Francisco, California, US","1000","2024-01-01","English","ThousandEyes","**Title:** Tata Cable Cut Affects SaaS Services Worldwide  
**Published Date:** 01/01/2024  
  
At 15:35 UTC (21:05 Mumbai, 8:35 Pacific) on February 25th, Tata Communications reported a cable cut between India and Singapore affecting nearly 350 Gbit per sec of capacity. We received a notification via one of our hosting providers in India. Even prior to the notification, we began seeing issues across a range of services where traffic was flowing to and from India. From more than 60 services that we were testing, we saw packet loss increase to over 3% in Asia and rise above 20% in India and Malaysia.

Our agents in New Delhi and Kuala Lumpur reported elevated packet loss and latency to many international services that transit Tata and Bharti Airtel, the two primary international transit providers to India and a major provider to Malaysia. For several hours this packet loss ranged from 10-30% and latency increased by 200-300ms.

### Tata’s Undersea Cable Network

Tata Communications operates the largest subsea fiber optic cable network in the world and is a Tier 1 network provider. Tata has capacity on 3 cables between India and Singapore: SEA-ME-WE 3 and 4 (which are shared with other operators) and Tata Indicom (owned solely by Tata). This cable cut appeared to affect the Tata Indicom Cable (TIC), as we saw traffic affected on the Chennai to Singapore route, with severe congestion in Singapore.

### Global Services Affected

Many services with data centers in East Asia and the western United States were affected by the Tata cable cut, given the importance of Tata as a transit provider between India and Singapore. Services that were impacted from India included Box, Docusign, Facebook, Oracle CRM, RingCentral, Salesforce and SAP.

Instability occurred throughout Tata’s network, with POPs as far away as Chicago and San Jose registering >50% packet loss. We tracked packet loss and latency until 18:15 UTC, nearly 3 hours, before many Indian networks switched traffic to Bharti Airtel. This often caused increased latency, as traffic peered in suboptimal locations, such as London for traffic destined for Australia.","The article titled 'Tata Cable Cut Affects SaaS Services Worldwide' discusses a significant incident involving a cable cut between India and Singapore operated by Tata Communications.

It details the timing of the incident, the capacity affected (350 Gbit per sec), and the resulting packet loss and latency increases across various services.

The article highlights the impact on internet connectivity and communication, particularly for services reliant on Tata as a transit provider.

It provides concrete evidence of the consequences of the cable cut, such as increased packet loss (over 30% in some areas) and the subsequent routing changes made by networks.

**Internet Outages & Trends**

There’s a line in the ThousandEyes Cloud Performance Report that I often return to that ponders the extent to which enterprise data is “in the cloud or under the sea.” The answer, of course, may be both: It’s in the cloud at-rest and under the sea in-transit.

Whether in the cloud or sea, that infrastructure needs to be understood by everyone who holds responsibility for that data and how it makes its way between different components of the end-to-end service delivery chain that underpins digital experience delivery. A suboptimal understanding can translate into customer-facing problems, manifesting as either degradation or an inability to access a digital service and/or transact with it.

The growing complexity of subsea and terrestrial cable infrastructure that underpins both enterprises’ and the world’s traffic flows presents a challenge for IT teams, who are trying to understand all the interactions, relationships, and dependencies that can impact their services and applications.

Subsea cables are the backbone of international data movement today, with the Internet heavily reliant on undersea cables for high-capacity communications. A widely-cited piece of research suggests that 97% of the world’s Internet traffic is carried via subsea routes. Subsea cables increasingly also have a role to play in even domestic traffic management, with subsea routes being used in place of terrestrial fiber for intercapital or interstate routes as well.

Whether terrestrial or subsea, fiber cabling is susceptible to damage and that can lead to disruption or degraded performance on key routes. On terrestrial routes, breakages are often accidental damage caused by heavy earthmoving equipment, whose operators are unaware of cable paths prior to excavation work taking place. An equivalent hazard exists for undersea cables. At either end, the cables run through relatively shallow waters to a cable landing station, from which traffic is pushed onto terrestrial links. While the coastal zoning around landing stations tends to be protected, their nature means they may be exposed to encounters with shipping and other marine traffic. Heavy anchors, propellers, and cables do not mix. Add stormy weather into the area and accidental breakages can often occur. Even as cables run over the seabed in deeper water, there are other hazards to consider: Seismic activity and even sharks have been considered problematic in the past.

When damage does occur, locating a cut and re-splicing the fiber is considerably easier on terrestrial routes than it is for subsea. Repairing a damaged subsea cable can take some time, depending on the availability of the repair vessel, its engagement status, and its presence in the area. Additionally, time is needed to locate and fix the fault.

All that being said, submarine cables are increasingly designed with resilience, diverse paths, and multiple cable systems to ensure continued functionality. Increasing the number and diversity of cable routes can offer some mitigation. Establishing a high level of redundancy enhances resilience and helps to ensure that any damage is unlikely to have a significant impact on a user's digital experience.

Both geostationary and low earth orbit (LEO) satellites can also provide additional options to ensure business continuity, helping to supplement and fill gaps. Although they cannot entirely compensate for widespread cable loss, they can at least guarantee that crucial messages are transmitted and provide a feasible option for aligning application characteristics with infrastructure constraints, thereby reducing the load on subsea infrastructure.

The vastness of today’s subsea cable ecosystem drives home the importance of understanding your end-to-end service delivery chain, and the routes that traffic takes or may take as part of your digital experience delivery.

In our Cloud Performance Report, ThousandEyes analyzed network performance data to help organizations determine the optimal cloud ecosystems and zones/regions for their needs, based on ingress/egress points, how traffic reached those points (sometimes via subsea routes), and whether those routes were operationally acceptable.

But more than that, with so much traffic—domestic and international—traversing subsea paths, it’s critical to understand how and where those cables are landed, and what onward paths exist for that traffic, in order to really drive optimization and improvement in digital experience delivery. Careful attention and visibility here may reduce the risk of experiencing a reduction in capacity due to accidental cable breakage. It may also provide an evidentiary basis to align with providers that have prioritized capacity between the cable landing station and their nearest point-of-presence—upgrade work that has been occurring in Virginia recently.

On August 29, AWS experienced a global issue between 8:32 AM and 9:58 AM (UTC) that impacted access to multiple cloud services. The problems manifested as an inability to contact AWS service endpoints in us-east-1 from seven other regions, among them us-gov-west-1. “Customers may also have received error messages when contacting the global STS (Security Token Service) endpoint from the affected regions,” AWS said.

The problems manifested as accessibility issues, and the company initially suspected a problem with its identity and access management service. However, upon their investigation, AWS engineers found the root cause to be an unspecified “networking issue,” which they remediated, allowing accessibility to recover.

In my experience, misidentifying the root cause of a degradation or outage happens fairly often, even more so when customers are unable to authenticate to or access services. Users, and even engineers, can too quickly draw their own conclusions about the root cause. However, as we have observed, some outages are not what they seem, and having independent visibility of every component of the service delivery chain can help teams accurately identify the root cause, and recognize “false flags” for what they are.

On August 26, ServiceNow experienced an outage that affected some customers, preventing them from accessing their ServiceNow instances. The outage was first observed around 7:25 PM (UTC) and initially appeared to be originating from ServiceNow’s environment, with an increase in network connection and server timeouts observed across ServiceNow servers.

During the incident, the ServiceNow network experienced a higher than normal loss rate across multiple ISPs. This suggests an increase in network traffic that was overwhelming the network circuits—a classic sign of a potential DDoS attack. ServiceNow later confirmed that DDoS activity caused a surge in network traffic that saturated externally-facing network circuits in their Arizona and Ontario data centers.","The article discusses subsea cables, their susceptibility to damage, and the implications of such damage on internet connectivity.

The company announced at its Google Cloud Roadshow event last week that it was going back to some of the 100,000 miles of private fibre optic cable that it owns around the world and reinforcing it with the protective material. At least part of the reason is to minimise the damage that results from frequent and unexplainable shark attacks, said product manager Dan Belcher.

Fibre optic cables use lasers to send data across the ocean, allowing transfer rates up to 100 times higher than traditional copper cables. But they are made of fragile glass strands so need to be protected from any knocks or sharp movements. At the event Google said that it was now using a “Kevlar-like material” in order to do this.

For unknown reasons sharks seem drawn to the data cables that rest on the ocean floor. One attack has even been caught on camera, as you can see in the video clip below.

The issue dates back to at least 1985, when shark teeth were found buried deep in the coating of an experimental fiber optic line off the Canary Islands.

The New York Times reported in 1987 that sharks had shown an “inexplicable taste” for the then-new technology, causing at least four failures on the cables linking the US, Europe and Japan.

“The attacks have caused some delays in laying cable, and a single bite on a deep-sea line, which is about the size of a garden hose, can cost $250,000 or more to fix. There is a benefit, however. In studying ways to limit damage from the attacks, the telephone companies are providing marine scientists with valuable new data on sharks and specimens of previously unknown species,” reported the paper.

The reason for sharks biting cables is unknown. In the 1987 story a spokesman for AT&T describes catching sharks and seeing if they would eat segments of cable: ''They got this one big shark on deck and tried to force-feed him samples of cable to see how he'd react. He was not happy about having someone try to shove it down his mouth.''

This has led some to suggest that it is actually the data that they are attracted to, or at least the electromagnetic signals it gives off, which could appear similar to those given off by fish and other creatures which sharks feed on. Sharks have been shown to detect electromagnetic signals given off by prey.

Earlier this week it was announced that Google was working with Asian telecoms companies to build and operate a new trans-Pacific cable network connecting the United States to Japan.

The consortium of companies – which also includes China Mobile International, China Telecom Global, Global Transit, KDDI and SingTel – will invest approximately $300 million (£179m) in the system, known as 'Faster'. The aim is to address the intense traffic demands for broadband, mobile, applications, content and enterprise data exchange on the trans-Pacific route.

It will have an initial capacity of 60 terabits per second and will connect Los Angeles, Portland, San Francisco, Oregon and Seattle to Chikura and Shima in Japan.","The article discusses the impact of shark bites on undersea internet cables, providing specific examples of incidents where sharks have damaged these cables.

It details the financial costs associated with repairs, which can exceed $250,000 for a single bite, and references historical incidents dating back to 1985.

Moreover, it explains the unusual nature of the problem, suggesting that sharks may be attracted to the electromagnetic signals emitted by the cables.

This indicates a significant impact on internet connectivity and communication.

Overall, the article is centered around the topic of cut sea cables, specifically through the lens of shark attacks, which aligns with the criterion."

Американские военные и представители спецслужб высказали опасения, что Россия может повредить эти кабели в случае конфликта или роста напряженности в отношениях с Западом.

Если Рф нарушит целостность оптоволоконных кабелей в каком-либо из самых труднодоступных мест, это приведет к прерыванию интернет-коммуникаций, от которых зависят правительства, бизнес и обычные граждане. Пока таких инцидентов не было, но Пентагон обеспокоен ростом активности российских военно-морских сил.

Так в сентябре корабль «Янтарь», который Россия называет океанографическим исследовательским судном, а Пентагон подозревает в проведении разведывательных операций, проходил вдоль восточного побережья США в направлении Кубы. По данным источников, корабль и два его самоходных глубоководных аппараты могли повредить важный оптоволоконный кабель, проходящий рядом с военно-морской базой США в бухте Гуантанамо.

Как отметил специалист по международным отношениям в киберпространстве, кабели повреждаются очень часто. Это может происходить из-за якорей кораблей или подводных катастроф. Однако это, как правило, происходит недалеко от берега, и исправить повреждения можно в течение нескольких дней.

Пентагон обеспокоен, что Россия, очевидно, ищет уязвимые места в кабелях на большой глубине, где повреждения будет трудно обнаружить и исправить. Кроме того, по словам источников, Россия может искать тайные кабели, используемые для военных коммуникаций.

В настоящее время кабели передают данные, обеспечивающие функционирование бизнеса общей капитализацией в 10 триллионов долларов в день. Любое серьезное повреждение прервет потоки капитала.

Министр обороны Великобритании Грант Шеппс в среду объявил, что в Персидский залив и прилегающий регион идет эсминец Королевского флота HMS Diamond. Там он присоединится к фрегату HMS Lancaster и трем минным тральщикам.  

Фрегат HMS Lancaster и три минных тральщика Королевского флота находятся в регионе Персидского залива с прошлого года.  

“Для Британии критически важно увеличить наше присутствие в регионе, чтобы защищать наши интересы во все более нестабильном мире”, — сказал Грант Шеппс.

However, with enough determination and a little bit of ingenuity even cables in the deepest waters can be damaged, whether intentionally or not.

The latest report from [Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/q1-2024-internet-disruption-summary) on internet disruptions pins damage to submarine cables as the leading cause of internet outages in the first quarter of 2024.

**Restrictions, disruptions, and unrest**  
The most significant deliberate disruption of internet traffic was caused by Houthi rebels operating in the Red Sea, who have cut three cables in the region alongside disrupting international shipping in a campaign of missile and drone strikes against traffic navigating the Suez canal. The Europe India Gateway, Seacom/Tata, and Asia Africa Europe-1 cables all had signs of intentional damage most likely done using a ship's anchor, the report states.

Cables surrounding the African coastline have been particularly vulnerable to underwater rockfalls, with the West African Cable System, Submarine Atlantic 3/West Africa Submarine Cable, African Coast to Europe and MainOne all receiving damage in this manner.

Elections, periods of civil unrest, or a combination of the two also contributed to outages in some regions of the world, usually done to suppress protests and control the flow of information, with Chad, Pakistan and Senegal all showing fluctuations and outages in regular traffic.

War is obviously another contributing factor for regions experiencing internet outages, with Ukraine, Sudan and Palestine all suffering impacts to their connectivity, with Ukraine's disruptions being largely caused by Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukrainian energy production infrastructure.

April 21, 2024

Bangladeshi internet users are experiencing disruptions after the country's second submarine cable, SEA-ME-WE 5, the largest supplier of international bandwidth to Bangladesh, broke Friday night.

“The issue was identified at midnight. It will take at least two to three days to resume the connection,” Mirza Kamal Ahmed, managing director of Bangladesh Submarine Cables PLC (BSCPLC), told The Daily Star.

International bandwidth usage in Bangladesh now stands at around 5,200Gbps (Gigabits per second). More than half of it — about 2,700 Gbps — comes through international terrestrial cable (ITC) licence holders that import bandwidth from India across land borders.

The South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 5 (SEA-ME-WE 5) submarine cable installed in Kuakata supplies 1,700Gbps.

The undersea cable of the SEA-ME-WE 5 got broken in a spot between Singapore and Malaysia, the official said.

For that, all circuits of all members of the consortium got down, he added.

“So, a ship will be mobilised to repair and restore the service. The total operation will take minimum of two to three days,” he added.

The SEA-ME-WE 5 is a 20,000km submarine cable system connecting 17 countries through Points-of-Presence from Singapore to the Middle East to France and Italy in Western Europe.

The cable that lay on the eastern side that connected Singapore got broken, while the connectivity on the western side that connected France remained operational, he added.

For that, of the 1,700Gbps of bandwidth that comes through the system, only 100Gbps bandwidth will be supplied to Bangladesh.

The BSCPLC is now exploring ways to restore the circuits of SEA-ME-WE 5 with SEA-ME-WE 4, the country's first submarine cable installed in Cox's Bazar.

Nearly 800Gbps bandwidth is provided by the first undersea cable with which Bangladesh was connected in 2006. It currently supplies about 850Gbps bandwidth and its capacity has recently been upgraded to 3,800Gbps.

The BSCPLC is set to receive 13,200Gbps from a [third undersea cable](https://subtelforum.com/3-more-private-submarine-cables-for-bangladesh/) SEA-ME-WE 6 by 2025.","The article titled 'Submarine Cable Break Slows Internet in Bangladesh' provides detailed information about the breakage of the SEA-ME-WE 5 submarine cable, which significantly affects internet connectivity in Bangladesh.

Ngày 5/12, đại diện một nhà cung cấp dịch vụ Internet (ISP) tại Việt Nam cho biết đối tác quốc tế đã sửa xong sự cố xảy ra ngày 27/9/2023 trên tuyến cáp quang biển quốc tế Asia Africa Europe 1 (AAE-1) vào chiều ngày 22/11/2023 và hiện tuyến cáp này đã hoạt động ổn định trở lại.

Là 1 trong 5 tuyến cáp quang biển chiếm phần lớn dung lượng kết nối Internet từ Việt Nam đi quốc tế, AAE-1 đóng vai trò nâng cao chất lượng kết nối hướng châu Âu, Trung Đông cũng như cung cấp bổ sung thêm dung lượng và dự phòng tới các hướng kết nối đi Hong Kong (Trung Quốc) và Singapore.

Sự cố xảy ra vào sáng ngày 27/9/2023 đã gây mất dung lượng trên hướng cáp kết nối đi Singapore của tuyến AAE-1.

Vị đại diện trên cũng cho hay vào ngày 6/11/2023, đối tác quốc tế cũng đã hoàn thành công tác sửa chữa, khắc phục sự cố trên nhánh cáp gần trạm cập bờ Vũng Tàu (Việt Nam) của tuyến cáp quang biển quốc tế Asia America Gateway (AAG).

Tuyến cáp biển AAG được đưa vào khai thác từ tháng 11/2009. Có tổng chiều dài hơn 20 ngàn km, tuyến cáp này kết nối trực tiếp khu vực Đông Nam Á với Mỹ.

AAG đi qua Malaysia, Singapore, Thái Lan, Việt Nam (nhánh cáp rẽ vào Việt Nam dài 314km, điểm cập bờ tại Bà Rịa - Vũng Tàu), Brunei, Hong Kong (Trung Quốc), Philippines và Mỹ.

Như vậy, thời điểm hiện tại, cả 5 tuyến cáp quang biển mà các nhà mạng tại Việt Nam sử dụng, khai thác để cung cấp dịch vụ cho người dùng, gồm AAG, APG, AAE-1, SMW3 và IA (còn gọi là Liên Á) đều đang duy trì hoạt động bình thường.

Trước đó, vào cuối năm 2022 và đầu năm 2023, cả 5 tuyển cáp quang biển kể trên đã cùng gặp sự cố. Tình huống hy hữu này đã gây khó khăn lớn cho các doanh nghiệp viễn thông tại Việt Nam trong việc đảm bảo chất lượng dịch vụ Internet quốc tế cho các khách hàng. Khó khăn này đã được Bộ Thông tin và Truyền thông chỉ đạo các doanh nghiệp viễn thông giải quyết trong quý II/2023.

Theo ước tính của các chuyên gia, tổng dung lượng Internet Việt Nam đi quốc tế qua 5 tuyến cáp này là khoảng 18 Tbps, với hiệu suất sử dụng khoảng 65%.

Khi 1 tuyến gặp sự cố thì hiệu suất sử dụng lên 90%, lúc này chất lượng dịch vụ không bị ảnh hưởng. Tuy nhiên, khi có từ 2 tuyến cáp biển gặp sự cố cùng lúc, hiệu suất sử dụng các tuyến cáp biển là trên 100% và lúc này thì chất lượng dịch vụ bị ảnh hưởng.

Để khắc phục, nhiều giải pháp đã được triển khai, cụ thể như các doanh nghiệp viễn thông có sở hữu dung lượng đi quốc tế đã tổ chức ký hợp đồng hoán đổi dung lượng.

Khi mất đồng thời toàn bộ dung lượng trên 2 tuyến cùng lúc, các nhà mạng cũng đã bổ sung, ứng cứu dung lượng tối đa trên cáp đất và các tuyến cáp còn lại để đáp ứng nhu cầu kết nối Internet quốc tế.

Phát biểu tại sự kiện Ngày Internet Việt Nam 2023 mới đây, Thứ trưởng Bộ Thông tin và Truyền thông Phạm Đức Long nhấn mạnh Internet Việt Nam đã phát triển mạnh mẽ, đã và đang mang lại nhiều cơ hội cho sự phát triển kinh tế đất nước. Tuy vậy, ông Long cũng đánh giá hạ tầng Internet nói chung của Việt Nam còn hạn chế so với quy mô người dùng Internet và dân số. Một minh chứng cho nhận định này là các doanh nghiệp viễn thông Việt Nam chỉ đang khai thác, sử dụng 5 tuyến cáp quang biển.

Thứ trưởng Phạm Đức Long cũng cho biết Bộ Thông tin và Truyền thông đang xây dựng và sẽ sớm ban hành Chiến lược/Kế hoạch phát triển cáp quang quốc tế Việt Nam, với mục tiêu là đảm bảo hạ tầng số Việt Nam phát triển an toàn, bền vững.

Trước đó, hồi cuối tháng 9/2023, đại diện Cục Viễn thông (Bộ Bộ Thông tin và Truyền thông) cho biết, dự kiến đến cuối năm 2026 hệ thống cáp biển kết nối Internet từ Việt Nam đi quốc tế sẽ được đưa vào sử dụng bổ sung 3 tuyến ADC, SJC2, ALC có các doanh nghiệp viễn thông trong nước tham gia đầu tư.

Mục tiêu đến năm 2030 số tuyến cáp biển mà các doanh nghiệp viễn thông Việt Nam tham gia đầu tư thêm tối thiểu 6 tuyến, trong đó có khoảng 3 tuyến do doanh nghiệp viễn thông Việt chủ trì./.","The article discusses the repair of five important undersea cables for Vietnam's internet connectivity, specifically mentioning incidents that caused disruptions.

The Intra Asia (IA) cable system encountered problems on January 28 when a cable breakage happened about 130 kilometers from a shoreline station in Singapore, leading to a total loss of international data from Vietnam to the city-state, the ISP said.

This system, with a total length of 6,800 kilometers, has been in operation since November 2009 to connect Internet users in Singapore, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan, and Vietnam.

It also served as an important route for Internet data transit to the Americas and Europe from users in Vietnam and other regional countries.

On January 21, the APG cable system faced an incident on its S9 branch connecting to Singapore, interrupting the connection between Vietnam and Singapore and Japan.

This line runs about 10,400 kilometers underwater across the Pacific Ocean, linking Vietnam with mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Singapore.

Two other undersea cable routes, AAG and AAE-1, have had troubles since the end of 2022 and have not been fixed yet.

In addition to these five lines, Vietnam is hooked up to two other submarine Internet cables, SJC2 and ADC, but they are not yet officially operational, _Thanh Nien_ (Young People) newspaper reported.

The latest incident means that Vietnam currently has only one undersea cable line left, the SMW3, to link the country to the world.

However, this system is outdated and is about to be discarded, according to ISPs.

Russia has put increasing emphasis on building up a dedicated military unit, which deploys a formidable fleet of surface ships, submarines and naval drones, according to one of the officials. The unit, the “General Staff Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research,” is known by its Russian acronym GUGI.

“We are concerned about heightened Russian naval activity worldwide and that Russia’s decision calculus for damaging US and allied undersea critical infrastructure may be changing,” a US official told CNN. “Russia is continuing to develop naval capabilities for undersea sabotage mainly thru GUGI, a closely guarded unit that operates surface vessels, submarines and naval drones.”

The US regularly tracks Russian ships that patrol close to critical maritime infrastructure and undersea cables often far from Russian shores, the official said. US concern about the secretive Russian unit’s undersea operations has not been previously reported. CNN has requested comment from the Russian Ministry of Defense.

Undersea cables form a critical backbone of internet and telecommunications traffic around the world. Most communications and internet traffic travels across a vast network of high-speed fiber-optic cables installed along the ocean floor. A coordinated attack could significantly disrupt private, government and military communications along such cables as well as industries that rely on such communications, including financial markets and energy suppliers.

Undersea cables also carry vast amounts of electricity among several European countries.

The US and its allies closely monitor Russian naval activity over key undersea cables around the world. Commanders aboard a NATO patrol vessel in April 2023 told CNN they had witnessed an increase of such activity over undersea cables in the Baltic Sea in recent years.

The seas around Northern Europe are a focus of such Russian military surveillance and activity. Last year, a joint investigation by the public broadcasters of Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland found that Russia has a fleet of suspected spy ships operating in northern European waters for potential sabotage of both undersea cables and wind farms.

Using data analysis, intercepted radio communications and intelligence sources, the broadcasters tracked over several years some fifty ships operating in the area, using underwater surveillance to map sites for potential attacks.

Taiwanese and US forces have seen similar activity by the Chinese Navy in waters around Taiwan. “The activity looks like targeted harassment by Beijing – or an exercise in preparation for cutting off the whole of Taiwan,” Elisabeth Braw wrote in Foreign Policy magazine in February 2023.

Russia’s threatening activity has not been disrupted by its ongoing war against Ukraine. The Russian leadership places great value on GUGI, a US official told CNN, continuing to fund the unit even while waging war in Ukraine.

A US official told CNN the US would consider any such sabotage of undersea infrastructure as a significant escalation in Russian aggression outside of Ukraine.

“Any activities that damaged seabed infrastructure including undersea cables especially during periods of heightened tensions risks misunderstandings and misperceptions that could lead to unintended escalation,” the US official told CNN. “The US would be especially concerned about damage to our or our allies’ critical undersea infrastructure.","The article discusses the increasing risk of Russian sabotage of key undersea cables, detailing the activities of a Russian military unit involved in potential sabotage operations.

Согласно изданию, российская сторона «не так сильно полагается на кабели», однако «располагает значительным флотом разведывательных подводных лодок, предназначенных для работы с ними».

Из публикации Forbes следует, что российские действия по блокировке подводных кабелей могут парализовать растущую международную цифровую экономику. «Около 99 процентов нашего трансокеанского трафика данных проходит через подводные кабели, включая финансовые транзакции, электронную почту, социальные сети и, конечно же, военную связь», — описывает американское издание.

Согласно Forbes, первое, что может знать Запад о российской операции против кабелей, — это прибытие в соответствующий район тяжелого ракетного подводного крейсера стратегического назначения проекта 941 «Акула», который «может быть очень незаметным» и «будет окружать целевую зону для защиты периметра от слежки с подводных лодок НАТО».

«Чтобы добраться до кабеля на морском дне, у россиян есть уникальные атомные глубоководные станции [АГС]», — продолжает издание, отмечая, что для их развертывания используется специальная субмарина-носитель. Forbes отмечает, что подобные модернизированные подлодки получают ракетное вооружение, вследствие чего могут больше не нуждаться в прикрытии другими субмаринами.

Forbes напоминает, что одной из АГС была сгоревшая в июле 2019 года автономная станция АС-31 «Лошарик» проекта 10831. Самым современным носителем подобных АГС издание называет субмарину БС-64 «Подмосковье» проекта 09787.

«Интернет-кабели зацепляются якорями судов относительно регулярно, но это, как правило, происходит на мелководье, где ремонт выполняется достаточно быстро. С помощью глубоководных подводных лодок-шпионов Россия может работать на глубине не менее 900 метров», — отмечает издание.

Forbes признает, что «в открытом доступе нет веских доказательств того, что Россия в настоящее время проводит какие-либо операции против западных подводных кабелей. Но нельзя отрицать, что Россия продолжает вкладывать значительные средства в возможности сделать это».

В июле 2019 года министр обороны России Сергей Шойгу поставил задачу в кратчайшие сроки восстановить глубоководный аппарат АС-31 «Лошарик», в ходе аварии на котором, случившейся ранее в том же месяце, погибли 14 моряков.

Тогда же в Военно-морском институте США заявили, что АГС АС-31 «Лошарик» была предназначена для развертывания в Северной Атлантике, в частности, проведения операций на условной линии, соединяющей Гренландию и Британские острова (Фареро-Исландском рубеже), где располагается американская гидроакустическая противолодочная звуковая система наблюдения SOund SUrveillance System (SOSUS).","The article discusses the capabilities of Russian submarines to potentially block undersea telecommunications cables connecting the US and Europe.

On Thursday, 14 March, four submarine cables – Wacs, Ace, Sat-3 and MainOne – snapped under the ocean off Ivory Coast, impacting internet services across the region. In South Africa, Microsoft struggled to keep its platforms available, with many assuming the two events were directly related.

Office workers across South Africa were left without access to their e-mail, to the Teams video conferencing app and other Microsoft services. Services were fully restored by the weekend of Saturday, 16 March.

Some of the largest banks’ websites were inaccessible for a few hours, while telecommunications operators, including Vodacom, also struggled.

Microsoft said the cable breaks reduced the total capacity supporting its Azure data centre regions in South Africa, namely South Africa North and South Africa West. These refer to Microsoft’s two data centre regions in South Africa, one of which is located in Gauteng, and the other in the Western Cape.

But why would an undersea cable outage thousands of kilometres away affect local data centre services – after all, isn’t half the point of having these facilities located in-country to avoid these types of interruptions? Also, Microsoft’s most direct rival, Amazon Web Services, which operates data centres in Cape Town, appeared to be less impacted. (AWS declined to comment for this story.)

Asked for comment, Microsoft didn’t directly address the issue, saying in an e-mail to TechCentral: “We’ve fixed the service interruption that some customers may have experienced caused by damage to key subsea cable systems which manage traffic in and out of the Africa region. We’ve worked with local partner carriers to implement capacity on new, diverse systems within the region. We also reconfigured some existing infrastructure to get back to pre-impact levels of capacity and remediate impact.”

Jon Tullett, IT services research manager for IDC sub-Saharan Africa, explained that, in fact, there were two related issues playing themselves out simultaneously, impacting access to Microsoft services.

### Office 365 outage

“One was the multiple cable outages affecting African internet connectivity, which included access to offshore cloud services. And Microsoft had an Office 365 outage affecting customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa on specific products,” he said.

“It’s also worth remembering is that this isn’t without precedent. This wasn’t the first Office 365 network-related outage, and not even the first this year.”

On the cable breaks, Tullett said AWS and other cloud providers weren’t affected in the same way, but for many users in Africa, cloud services were unreachable, “regardless of the service provider”.

Tullett said Microsoft 365 (previously Office 365) was probably hit hard because “it is a massive and complex productivity software stack, spread across the world; it’s a different beast from solutions which can be fully geographically isolated, whether those are from a competitor or Microsoft itself. It’s not like the entire Azure stack fell over. Some of that difference is implicit, but some is also design and provisioning choices made by Microsoft.”

Jon Tullett

“In-country Azure IaaS (infrastructure as a service) and in-country AWS IaaS are comparable, and neither was unaffected, for instance. But offshore IaaS was affected, so if you have workloads in South Africa which depended on remote resources – even though they may seem minor – it could have a domino effect.”

Tullett said he spoke to an African financial services provider after the cables incident who had a core software stack fail because a single component dependency was located in an offshore cloud and inaccessible. This caused on-premise software components to fail.

“That highlights several cloud risks, and that’s a big topic in itself. But resilience and continuity need constant testing for curveball outages, and complex hybrid cloud infrastructure is harder to test by definition. That’s true whether you’re an end-user customer or a hyperscale software-as-a-service provider,” he said. – _© 2024 NewsCentral Media_

Trong đó, IA (Liên Á) là tuyến cáp quang biển quốc tế gặp sự cố mới nhất, xảy ra vào rạng sáng hôm nay.

2 tuyến cáp quang biển còn lại cũng đang gặp sự cố đó là APG (Châu Á Thái Bình Dương) và AAE-1 (châu Á - châu Phi - châu Âu).

Việc có đến 3/5 tuyến cáp quang biển nối Việt Nam đi quốc tế đang gặp sự cố đã ảnh hưởng nghiêm trọng đến lưu lượng kết nối internet tại Việt Nam đi quốc tế. Người dùng tại Việt Nam sẽ gặp khó khăn khi truy cập vào các trang web, dịch vụ có máy chủ đặt tại nước ngoài.

Trong khi đó, sự cố gặp phải trên các tuyến cáp quang sẽ không ảnh hưởng đến những trang web và dịch vụ đặt máy chủ tại Việt Nam.

Sau khi sự cố xảy ra với các tuyến cáp quang biển, các nhà mạng tại Việt Nam đã áp dụng nhiều phương án chia sẻ lưu lượng giữa các tuyến cáp quang kết nối quốc tế, mở các kênh truy cập bổ sung, tận dụng các tuyến cáp quang trên đất liền... để đảm bảo kết nối của người dùng.

Hiện vẫn chưa rõ lịch sửa chữa cũng như thời điểm các tuyến cáp quang được khắc phục sự cố.

Có 5 tuyến cáp quang biển kết nối Việt Nam đi quốc tế, bao gồm AAG (châu Á - Mỹ); APG (Châu Á Thái Bình Dương); SMW-3 (Đông Nam Á - Trung Đông - Tây Âu); IA (Liên Á) và AAE-1 (châu Á - châu Phi - châu Âu). Ngoài ra, còn một tuyến cáp quang với quy mô nhỏ hơn, đó là TVH, có chiều dài chỉ 3.367km, nối Thái Lan, Việt Nam và Hồng Kông (Trung Quốc).

Ngoài các tuyến cáp quang biển, hiện tại vẫn còn một số tuyến cáp quang đất liền nối Việt Nam đi quốc tế, tuy nhiên phần lớn lưu lượng kết nối Internet tại Việt Nam đều được truyền tải thông qua các tuyến cáp quang ngầm dưới biển.

Trên thực tế việc sự cố gặp phải trên các tuyến cáp quang biển từ Việt Nam đi quốc tế đã trở nên rất quen thuộc trong thời gian qua, mà hầu như năm nào cũng gặp phải ít nhất một vài lần, gây không ít khó khăn và bất tiện cho người dùng internet trong nước.

Đỉnh điểm xảy ra vào cuối tháng 2 năm ngoái, khi toàn bộ 5/5 tuyến cáp quang biển nối Việt Nam đi quốc tế đồng loạt gặp sự cố, điều này đã ảnh hưởng nghiêm trọng đến chất lượng dịch vụ mạng internet tại Việt Nam.

Nguyên nhân dẫn đến sự cố cáp quang biển khá đa dạng, nhưng chủ yếu do sợi cáp nằm ở vị trí có nhiều tàu bè thả neo đậu hoặc tàu thuyền khi di chuyển quên kéo neo lên. Hậu quả là những chiếc neo này đã vô tình mắc vào sợi cáp quang làm đứt.

Đôi khi sự cố cáp quang liên quan đến nguồn điện hoặc đơn vị vận hành thực hiện bảo trì… cũng sẽ làm ảnh hưởng đến lưu lượng truyền tải của cáp quang. Tuy nhiên, những sự cố dạng này sẽ khắc phục được nhanh chóng và dễ dàng hơn.

Các nhà mạng tại Việt Nam đang tìm những giải pháp chuyển hướng khai thác các tuyến cáp quang trên đất liền để không ảnh hưởng bởi các sự cố đứt cáp quang biển. Tuy nhiên, trên thực tế hiện lưu lượng internet trên toàn cầu và kết nối giữa các lục địa chủ yếu vẫn phụ thuộc phần lớn vào các tuyến cáp quang biển.","The article titled ""3/5 tuyến cáp quang gặp sự cố, internet Việt Nam đi quốc tế bị ảnh hưởng"" discusses significant issues related to undersea cables connecting Vietnam to international internet services.

"Disagreement Over Undersea Cable Cuts: Accident or Sabotage?","Examines the cutting of BCS East-West and C-Lion1 cables; features conflicting views from US and European officials on the nature of the incidents.","https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/20/world/accident-or-sabotage-undersea-cables-intl/index.html","2024-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","Ivana Kottasová",Yes,"Ivana Kottasová","New York, NY, USA","1000000","2024-11-20","English","CNN","CNN —

Investigators are trying to crack the mystery of how two undersea internet cables in the Baltic Sea were cut within hours of each other, with European officials saying they believe the disruption was an act of sabotage and US officials suggesting it was likely an accident.

The two cables – the BCS East-West connecting Lithuanian and Sweden and the C-Lion1 linking Finland with Germany – were suddenly disrupted on Sunday and Monday.

European leaders were quick to voice their suspicions. Germany’s Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said that “nobody believes that these cables were accidentally severed.”

The foreign ministers of Finland and Germany said in a joint statement that they were “deeply concerned” about the incident and raised the possibility that it was part of a “hybrid warfare,” specifically mentioning Russia in their statement.

Their assessment was not plucked out of thin air. Russia has been accused of waging a hybrid war against Europe after a string of suspicious incidents, arson attacks, explosions and other acts of sabotage across multiple European countries were traced back to Moscow.

And the disruption to the cables came just weeks after the US warned that Moscow was likely to target critical undersea infrastructure. This followed months of suspicious movements of Russian vessels in European waters and the significant beefing up of a dedicated Russian secretive marine unit tasked with surveying the seabed.

But two US officials familiar with the initial assessment of the incident told CNN on Tuesday the damage was not believed to be deliberate activity by Russia or any other nation.

Instead, the two officials told CNN they believed it likely caused by an anchor drag from a passing vessel. Such accidents have happened in the past, although not in a quick succession like the two on Sunday and Monday.

The Kremlin on Wednesday rejected the “laughable” suggestions that it was involved, saying it was “absurd to keep blaming Russia for anything without any grounds.”

Still, law enforcement agencies in both Sweden and Finland indicated they believe the damage deliberate.

The Swedish Prosecuting Administration said Tuesday it launched a preliminary investigation into a suspected sabotage. Then on Wednesday, the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation announced it was opening a criminal investigation into the suspected crimes of aggravated criminal mischief and aggravated interference with communications.

One vessel in particuar has sparked the interest of authorities and online sleuths.

Vessel tracking data from Kpler shows the Chinese-flagged ship Yi Peng 3 crossed both cables at around the time each was cut. The BCS EastWest was cut around 10 a.m. local time on Sunday, according to the Lithuanian Armed Forces, and the C-Lion 1 was cut around 4 a.m. local time on Monday, per Finnish telecom provider Cinia.

The bulk carrier was sailing from a Russian port, where it docked for several days.

On Wednesday, the Danish Armed Forces said they were present in the area near Yi Peng 3, but did not say whether they pursued the vessel.

A US official and a Western intelligence official both named the Yi Peng 3 as the likely ship involved in the incident. However, sources said, the US has not yet found any ties between this ship and states or entities that would order such activity.

Such accidents have happened in the past, although not in a quick succession like the two on Sunday and Monday.

On Wednesday, Cinia updated the location it believed the cut occurred at – 50 miles farther west than initially thought – which matched the track of the Yi Peng 3. Roughly six hours after the second cable was cut, the Chinese vessel stopped for roughly half an hour before continuing on.

The vessel is currently anchored in international waters in the Kattegat, about 30 miles off the coast of Denmark and Sweden.

The Yi Pen 3 had been sailing out of the Baltic Sea after a stop in the port of Vistino, Russia. Ship tracking data shows that it crossed other undersea infrastructure in the Baltic, including four gas and oil pipelines, a power line and another telecommunications cable under construction.

Asked about the vessel during a press briefing on Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said he was “not aware of the situation.”

He said China “has always fully fulfilled its flag state obligations and requires Chinese ships to strictly abide by relevant laws and regulations.”

“We also attach great importance to protecting the safety of undersea infrastructure and work with the international community to actively promote the construction and protection of submarine cables and other global information infrastructure,” he said.

According to Dimitris Ampatzidis, an analyst at Kpler, the Yi Peng 3 is linked to Win Enterprise Ship Management and registered as owned by Ningbo YiPeng Shipping Co Ltd.

“As of November 20, 2024, neither the vessel nor these entities appear on published sanction lists. However, historical trade data shows the ship has transported Russian thermal coal and coal from Murmansk and Nakhodka on at least seven occasions,” Ampatzidis said.

CNN has reached out to both companies for comment.

CNN’s Allegra Goodwin, Jim Sciutto, Paul P. Murphy, Katie Bo Lillis and Stephanie Halasz contributed reporting.","The article titled 'Accident or sabotage?

**Author:** Valerie C. Coffey  
**Published Date:** 01/01/2001  

Cable providers are maximizing fiber optic network capacity, reach and value for increasingly advanced intercontinental communications. How vulnerable is an all-optical network to interruptions?  

A massive network of fiber optic cables lies deep under the seas across the Earth. The cables allow us to quickly send our emails and videos, and connect our browsers and phone calls to sites in far-away lands. This network isn’t new. Submarine data cables date back to 1850, when the first international telegraph cable (with a capacity of 10 words per minute) spanned the channel between England and France. As early as 1901, telegraph cables crisscrossed the oceans and connected all the continents except for Antarctica.

Subsequent cable generations included upgrades to telephone cables and data communications cables. Analog coaxial cables of steel-wrapped copper were widespread under the oceans beginning in the 1950s. The bandwidth of analog cable increased quickly in the 1960s and 70s, but the highest capacity systems required electrically powered repeaters to boost the signal every 6 to 9 kilometers, making them very expensive to install across oceans.

Starting in 1988, a massive 10-year build-out replaced the vast majority of these copper network cables with long-haul fiber optic cables. Today virtually all of the undersea long-haul communication cables are optical, as are land-based ones. Submarine data cables handle more than 95 percent of IP voice and data traffic between countries and continents, and 100 percent of international Internet traffic. Users in the United States, Europe and other well-connected regions often take for granted the ease of global communications.

The underwater cable network is a critical component to global commerce, and it’s growing. Spurring this growth is ever-increasing IP traffic, demand for higher bandwidth at reduced deployment cost and the need for additional routes and redundant cable systems that ensure resiliency. According to a comprehensive market research report by Global Industry Analysts, cumulative global installation of submarine optical fiber cable is projected to reach two million kilometers by 2018, up from just over a million kilometers in 2009.

**Capacity and design**  
A typical submarine communications cable has a diameter of 17 mm—about the size of a garden hose—for deep-water cable, to 70 mm for heavily armored cable in shallower water. The shallower the cable, the thicker its armor must be. The fiber optic core is typically encased in high-tensile-strength galvanized steel wires surrounding a copper sheath, surrounded by more layers of steel armor and polyethylene insulation.

The longest submarine cable is the Southeast Asia–Middle East–Western Europe (SEA-ME-WE 3) system stretching 39,000 kilometers from Norden, Germany, to Keoje, South Korea. The system connects 33 different countries with 39 landing points. The SEA-ME-WE 4 submarine cable project, completed in December 2005, covers approximately 20,000 kilometers of links from Marseille, France, via the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent to Tuas, Singapore. The new system was designed to complement and add redundancy to SEA-ME-WE 3, and uses dense wavelength division multiplexing technology to achieve 1.28 Tbit/s capacity for telephone, Internet, multimedia and various other broadband applications.

**Redundant links**  
One of the biggest challenges facing the submarine optical network is that many parts of the world are still vulnerable to disruptions in service due to lack of redundancy. Network architectures use redundant bidirectional links between stations, like roadways and water distribution systems, to prevent loss of use in the event that the signal from a link or station is lost. These so-called “self-healing” rings will loop traffic through operational parts of the ring when the shortest link is disrupted.

The cable industry is used to repairing faults, which happen less frequently than in terrestrial networks but take much more time to reach and repair (typically one to four weeks, compared with one day on land). Transatlantic cables require dozens of repairs each year, but the United States and Europe have ample redundancy, so a single cable failure is hardly noticeable. Cuts to cables in bottleneck areas like the Suez Canal (for cables connecting Europe to the Middle East, Asia and East Africa), however, can slow down or even completely disrupt service for weeks.

The most common threat to submarine cables are shipping and fishing activities. Roughly 70 percent of cable damage from anchor-dropping and trawling occurs in water less than 200 meters deep. While some countries designate “anchor-free” zones near cable routes, accidents happen. And some interruptions appear to be intentional attacks, the motivations of which are difficult to discern.

One of the worst service disruptions to date occurred 19 December 2008, when France Telecom announced that three major subsea optical cables were cut by either a ship’s anchor or bad weather. The cables included the FLAG Telecom cable, SEA-ME-WE 3 and SEA-ME-WE 4, linking Alexandria, Egypt; Sicily and Malta. The damage disrupted 75 percent of the Internet service connecting Europe with the Middle East, North Africa and India until it was repaired on 31 December. Rerouting of communications to other areas caused significant slowdowns in Internet connections and telephone calls.

A more recent incident involving three men suspected of scuba diving down to cut the SEA-ME-WE 4 cable off the coast of Egypt occurred in March 2013. Many experts feel that deliberate sabotage of underwater cables is far-fetched or unlikely, but the degree to which underwater-cable bottlenecks have the potential for serious disruptions is causing providers to look for alternate ways to connect the continents. According to an April 2013 report by TeleGeography, demand for capacity between Europe and Asia via Egypt ballooned 87 percent per year between 2007 and 2012. Yet planners of the SEA-ME-WE 5, by some accounts the granddaddy of all Europe-to-Asia submarine cables, are considering bypassing Egypt completely. Plans include terrestrial routes, or new submarine routes via South America, South Africa and even the Arctic.

And why not route cable through the Arctic? Toronto-based Arctic Fibre proposed a 15,700-km subsea backbone cable connecting Tokyo and London, passing through the Bering Strait and along the Northwest Passage through the Canadian and Alaskan arctic. According to the company, the route is 4,280 kilometers shorter than current low-latency routes through the Suez Canal. With steadily shrinking polar ice caps, deployment of such a system is possible in warmer months, although it would be difficult to repair it 12 months a year. The estimate to build the 24-Tbit/s capacity Arctic Fibre network is $620 million. Arctic Fibre is working to raise $220 million in equity funding from investors for a cable with 80 wavelengths at 100G. If successful, the route is slated for operation in January 2016.

**Submarine cable vs. Satellite**  
Why does most of our data still travel via submarine cables instead of satellites?  
* Data traffic through undersea optical fiber cables offer advantages in terms of reliability, security, capacity and cost.  
* Microwave satellite signals take about 0.2 seconds to travel roundtrip from the ground to an orbiting satellite, while optical submarine cables can send data across the Atlantic in 1/20th of that time, resulting in lower latency.  
* The microwave spectrum available to satellites is limited, while the spectrum available for optical communications has more room for increasing IP traffic.  
* Wavelength division multiplexing technology increases the capacity carried by single fibers and thereby reduces the number of cables required; deploying fewer and smaller cables is then more cost efficient for the amount of capacity versus the high cost of deploying and maintaining satellites.

**Natural causes**  
Natural disasters such as mudslides and typhoons are also a threat to undersea fiber. A magnitude-7 earthquake in Taiwan on 26 December 2006 damaged eight submarine cables, catastrophically cutting off communication to Hong Kong, South East Asia and China. Because Taiwan is located in a central point in Asia’s underwater network, a large population of cables is concentrated in the middle of a major seismic belt. The magnitude-9 earthquake and resulting tsunami in March 2011 off the coast of Japan that savaged the Fukushima nuclear power plant also damaged about half of the existing transpacific cables. Fortunately, the other half of the cables were undamaged so network operators were able to reroute traffic to minimize complete outages.

In June 2013, the Southeast Asia-Japan Cable (SJC) consortium announced an underwater fiber cable deployment that shores up reliability in the event of earthquakes. SJC, supplied by TE SubCom and NEC Corporation, links the countries or territories of Brunei, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and the Philippines, including the option to link with Thailand. SJC is an 8,900-km cable system that could further extend to 9,700 kilometers. Costing around $400 million, SJC consists of six fiber pairs with the initial design capacity of 28 Tbit/s to meet bandwidth-hungry applications such as Inte.","The article discusses various aspects of submarine optical cables and includes specific incidents of cable cuts, such as the significant disruption caused by the cutting of three major cables in December 2008 and a suspected deliberate cut in March 2013.

The Asia Pacific Gateway (APG) internet cable, which connects Vietnam with much of Asia, encountered a new technical problem on Saturday, while a problem that occurred last month has not been fixed.

A Vietnamese internet service provider said that according to the cable’s management unit, the new problem occurred 151 km offshore and has affected internet connections throughout the entire line.

A repair timeline has not been revealed.

The line encountered another problem on December 26, its fourth last year, when repairs on the Asia Africa Europe 1 (AAE-1) and the Asia America Gateway (AAG) undersea cables had also not yet been completed.

As of now, the AAG problem has still not been fixed.

Experts have said the issues would not cause severe disruptions to internet connections in Vietnam, as local providers are used to dealing with similar problems. Any disruptions would only occur at certain moments and not be prolonged, they said.

""They [internet providers] will gradually increase capacity on the remaining undersea cables and the land line,"" a source from the Vietnam Internet Association said.

Internet providers have revealed plans to serve increasing usage demand during the Lunar New Year holiday. Military-run Viettel said it will maximize capacity on its 4G network. FPT Telecom has announced that it will expand bandwidth for free for its fiberglass cable users.

The APG cable runs 10,400 kilometers (6,460 miles) under the Pacific Ocean, with connection points in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Vietnam, where 72% of the population is online, has six submarine cable systems, plus a 120-gigabit channel that runs overland through China.

As technological advancements and global connectivity through the internet continue to reshape the world, the control and security of essential communication arteries has become vital for both economic and political dominance. The two countries are vying for control of the undersea cables that carry the bulk of the world's internet traffic.

The United States has long been the dominant player in the undersea cable market. American companies own and operate the majority of the world's major cables. But China has been rapidly investing in new cables in recent years. In 2018, China surpassed the United States in the number of undersea cables it owns and operates. This growing Chinese investment in undersea cables has raised concerns in the United States.

The ongoing battle between the United States and China for control of the world's undersea cables is a major concern for the global economy.

Whether motivated by economic dominance, national security concerns, or technological advancements, the control of undersea internet cables holds immense implications for global communication networks. Concerns regarding data security, privacy, and the digital divide are paramount when discussing the impact of this conflict on the internet's future, especially in regions outside the USA and China. Beyond the immediate impact on global communication networks, the internet cables war has broader geopolitical consequences. Some major factors contributing to this conflict are; National Security Concerns: Each country perceives internet and data connectivity as critical for national security. The US considers China a potential cyber threat and fears that Chinese companies may use internet cables to spy or steal sensitive information. Similarly, China has concerns about US surveillance and potential interference with its networks.

In addition, the development and maintenance of undersea internet cables allow countries to exert control and influence over global digital communications. By controlling these cables, a nation can regulate data flow and potentially manipulate information. Both countries wish to assert their dominance in cyberspace. Furthermore, Internet cables serve as the backbone of global internet connectivity, enabling fast and reliable data transmission between countries. Both countries recognize the economic benefits of controlling or having extensive access to undersea cables.

Moreover, as two major powers in the digital realm, the US and China are vying for influence and attempting to counter each other's hegemony in the cyberspace. By challenging the dominance of American firms, China seeks to reduce its dependence on US-controlled internet infrastructure and promote its own technological standards and companies internationally.

The USA and China are engaged in an ongoing geopolitical rivalry, with both countries seeking to expand their global influence. This competition extends to the digital domain, where control over internet cables could amplify their power projection capabilities and influence over international affairs.

Some potential outcomes include: Disruption of internet connectivity: If undersea internet cables are damaged or cut intentionally during a cable war, it can disrupt the flow of internet traffic between countries and regions. This can result in a loss of connectivity, impacting businesses, individuals, and governments dependent on stable and fast internet access. Also, cutting off internet cables can lead to the isolation of certain regions or countries, making them less integrated with the broader global digital landscape.

During a cable war, adversaries may exploit the situation to launch cyberattacks on exposed systems, taking advantage of reduced communication and security measures. Additionally, governments involved in an internet cable war might attempt to control the flow of information by monitoring or censoring internet traffic passing through their territory. Again, disrupted internet connectivity and compromised data security can have substantial economic consequences. Businesses leveraging the internet for operations, communication, and international trade might experience interruptions or financial losses.

Similarly, the internet cable war might exacerbate geopolitical tensions between nations involved, potentially leading to a broader conflict. These tensions can have far-reaching implications beyond just internet connectivity and data security. The internet cable war might prompt countries to explore alternative ways to ensure internet connectivity and data security. This could involve investment in satellite-based internet solutions, exploring alternative cable routes, or strengthening domestic communication infrastructure.

Other countries and international organizations may play various roles in regulating and mediating disputes related to the internet cable war between the USA and China. The UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU) could work on coordinating global telecommunications networks. Also, the WTO can be involved in mediating commercial disputes arising from the internet cable war.

Furthermore, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) can play a role in facilitating negotiations and mediating between the US and China on internet cable matters. Moreover, Regional Organizations such as the European Union (EU), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), African Union (AU), can also participate in regulating and mediating disputes related to internet cables. These organizations often have policies and frameworks governing telecommunications, which can provide a basis for negotiations and resolution.

Hence, International Legal Frameworks can provide guidance in resolving disputes: Countries can refer to these legal frameworks to make their arguments and reach a resolution. International laws and treaties governing cyberspace, such as the United Nations' Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) and internet Governance Forums IGFs can be instrumental in mediating disputes and finding common ground between the US and China.

Overall, the internet cable war poses significant risks to global internet connectivity and data security, affecting economies, geopolitics, and individuals' digital rights and freedoms. Efforts to prevent or mitigate such conflicts are crucial to maintaining a stable and secure global internet ecosystem. Nonetheless, the roles of international organizations in mediating disputes, would likely be applicable in any similar conflicts.","The article discusses the geopolitical competition over undersea cables between the US and China, emphasizing the potential consequences of cable cuts, such as loss of connectivity and economic impacts.

**Author:** Joji Thomas Philip  
**Published Date:** 03/28/2013  

NEW DELHI: Internet speeds in India, especially for customers of Bharti Airtel, Tata Communications and state-owned BSNL and MTNL are set to be disrupted for the next 20-25 days, after a key undersea cable, carrying data traffic across 14 countries, from Singapore to France, was cut off the coast of Egypt. Two other key cable networks, linking Asia to Europe, were also allegedly damaged.  

The extent of the damage is still being assessed. “Currently, internet and data usage are low because of the festive season. India will feel the impact from Monday when offices and businesses come back. Telcos have diverted all traffic from the Atlantic route to the Pacific, but our connectivity to the latter route is not sufficient to cater to all of India’s traffic,” explained Rajesh Chharia, president at Association of Internet Service Providers of India.  

Bharti Airtel said that the cable cuts had not impacted its voice traffic but said it was taking all ‘necessary steps to ensure data services were available to our customers by routing traffic on alternative routes’.  

BSNL executives said the company was diverted its traffic on other cables linking India with the Europe and the US, but declined to reveal the extent of internet disruptions here. Reliance Communications said its customers were not impacted as its cable systems, including FEA, FALCON and HAWK, were not impacted, when the undersea cables were allegedly sabotaged.  

Executives with mobile phone companies, who did not want to be named, acknowledged that browsing speeds were likely to fall significantly in the coming days, even as they were unable to provide a timeframe as to when the problem will be resolved.  

On Thursday, Egypt announced that it has arrested three divers for allegedly slicing the South East Asia-Middle East-West Europe 4 (SEA-ME-WE 4) that runs from Singapore to France and connects Malaysia, Thailand, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, UAE, Tunisia and Algeria.","The article discusses the cutting of undersea cables, specifically mentioning a key cable cut off the coast of Egypt and its impact on internet speeds in India.

冷战时期，美国曾担心俄国人会窃听这些光缆——美国情报机构也在几十年前掌握了这种能力。但现在的担忧更加严重：俄罗斯在针对美国开展最极端的黑客行动时，可能会在美国最难到达的位置切断光纤线缆，中断西方政府、经济和公众日益依赖的实时通信。

虽然目前尚无任何光缆遭到切割的证据，但对于俄罗斯武装力量在世界各地加速活动，美国及其盟国的高级军事和情报官员变得日益警觉。与此同时，华盛顿内部的辩论说明，美国看待俄罗斯的一举一动时，眼光越来越不信任，这不禁让人想起冷战时期。

对于俄罗斯日益增多的海军活动，五角大楼和美国间谍机构的评估过程和结果属于高度机密，不会进行详细的公开讨论。如何监控这些活动，以及光缆被切断后又如何迅速恢复，美国官员对这些问题守口如瓶。但至少十多名官员已经用泛泛的措辞证实，此事已经受到五角大楼的极大关注。

“我每天都在担忧，俄罗斯可能正在做些什么，”美国海军太平洋潜艇舰队的指挥官弗雷德里克·J·罗吉少将(Rear Adm. Frederick J. Roegge)说。对于俄罗斯可能计划切断海底光缆的问题，他也不愿回答。

美国海军发言人威廉·马克斯中校(Cmdr. William Marks)在华盛顿表示：“听到有任何国家计划攻击通信光缆，都会令人担心；然而由于潜艇行动具有保密性，我们不会讨论具体细节。”

但是，私下里，指挥官和情报官员的措辞远远更加直接。他们说，从北海到东北亚，甚至是更接近美国海岸的海域，在已知光缆的沿线都监测到，俄罗斯的活动显著增加。这些光缆是全球电子通信和商业的命脉。

就在上个月，配备了两个自走式深海潜水器的俄罗斯间谍船“扬塔尔号”(Yantar)从美国东海岸缓缓驶向古巴，而一处主要光缆就位于关塔那摩湾美国海军基地附近。美国的间谍卫星、舰艇和飞机一直监控着那次巡航。海军官员说，扬塔尔号和它放出的潜水器，有能力切断海面以下数英里处的光缆。

“活动的程度堪比冷战时期，”一位欧洲高级外交官说。

北约(NATO)盟友挪威非常担心，以至请求邻国协助追踪俄罗斯潜艇。

前北约最高军事指挥官、现弗莱彻法律与外交学院(Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy)院长詹姆斯·斯塔夫里迪斯上将(Adm. James Stavridis)在上周的一封电子邮件中表示，“这个例子再次表明，尽管技术上取得了极大进步，但这个极度自负、强势的政权，似乎倒退了回去要使用冷战时期的手段。”

这些行动与俄罗斯向克里米亚、乌克兰东部和叙利亚等地扩张军事行动的做法相符。俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京(Vladimir Putin)试图在这些地方证明，俄罗斯陆军、海军和空军的势力范围要大得多。

“这里的风险是，任何国家都可能破坏这个系统，并且是以一种完全隐蔽的方式，都不用向该区域派遣配有光缆切割设备的军舰，”哈佛与麻省理工学院合作开展的一个研究项目的前项目主管迈克尔·西克里斯特(Michael Sechrist)说。该项目的部分资金由国防部提供。

“光缆被切断的事件时常发生，有时是被拖在后面的锚切断，有时是因为自然灾害而切断，”西克里斯特说。他在2012年发表了一篇论文，主题是海底光缆网络的缺点。但大部分情况都发生在距离海岸几英里的地方，几天便能修复。

最让五角大楼的规划者担心的是，俄罗斯关注的似乎是更深处的薄弱环节，那里的光缆很难监测，被破坏的地方也难以发现和修复。

西克里斯特指出，光缆的位置几乎不是秘密。“自从1860年代开始铺设海底线缆以来，水下线缆的路径往往都是相似的，”他说，因为光缆服务运营商希望铺设在有长期协议的熟悉环境里。

美国为军事行动委托埋放的特殊光缆是例外，位置保密，它们不会出现在广泛传播的地图上。官员称，俄罗斯可能是在寻找这种光缆。

光缆的作用比以往任何时候都更重要。全球每天有价值超过10万亿美元的商业活动通过光缆进行，包括金融机构每时每刻都在结算的交易。海底光缆还承载着超过95%的日常通讯。

海底光缆如此重要，以至于国土安全部(Department of Homeland Security)将其接岸区——大多在纽约、迈阿密和洛杉矶周边——列为头号“关键基础设施”。","The article discusses the potential threat of Russian military actions targeting undersea communication cables, which are critical for global internet communication.

**Il New York Times cita il Pentagono: avvistata la «Yantar» vicino a Guantanamo. La Us Navy: «Potrebbe fare operazioni di sabotaggio, lì passano i nostri cavi di fibre ottiche»**  

**di Guido Olimpio**  

WASHINGTON - È una partita che va avanti da tempo. E i grandi media americani hanno ignorato, con rarissime eccezioni, la «strana» attività di diverse navi russe. Ora però, in epoca di guerra fredda, l’attenzione si è risvegliata. Il New York Times, citando fonti del Pentagono, ha raccontato come unità e sottomarini di Mosca conducano missioni vicino ai cavi attraverso le quali passano le comunicazioni. Manovre in teatri lontani dagli Stati Uniti, alternate a perlustrazioni lungo la costa statunitense. Il timore dell’Us Navy - espresso chiaramente - è che possano condurre esercitazioni di sabotaggio oppure condurre operazioni di spionaggio.  

**Il rimorchiatore**  
Nella primavera del 2014, avevamo raccontato anche su Corriere.it le mosse del rimorchiatore d’altura «Chiker», arrivato dal Baltico e protagonista di un lungo viaggio. Prima nei pressi della Florida - vicino a siti sensibili -, quindi nei Caraibi. Non era certo nello scacchiere per restare al caldo. Forse era in appoggio a qualche sottomarino, in alternativa si è pensato a lavori subacquei grazie alla sua attrezzatura studiata proprio per quei compiti.  

**Intelligence**  
Il mese scorso è apparsa la «Yantar», nave per l’intelligence e le ricerche oceanografiche. Stesso modus operandi del «Chiker», compresa la classica sosta nel porto amico dell’Avana e una puntata verso l’enclave statunitense di Guantanamo, dove passa uno dei molti cavi di fibre ottiche. Altre hanno invece agito in Europa sollevando le preoccupazioni dei partner atlantici. Un diplomatico ha sostenuto che la situazione non è diversa dal periodo del confronto tra Nato e Patto di Varsavia, quando c’era ancora l’URSS. La Norvegia ha chiesto aiuto ai paesi amici per seguire le tracce dei russi considerati sempre più aggressivi su molti fronti. Il numero delle cosidette pattuglie sottomarine, per stessa ammissione del comando di Mosca, è cresciuto del 50 per cento, con molta attenzione anche all’Artico, oggi teatro di una sfida multinazionale. Anche a Russia e Cina avranno comunque le loro preoccupazioni. Gli Stati Uniti le prendono e le danno. La Marina conta su alcuni sottomarini - come il famoso «Jimmy Carter» - studiati per svolgere compiti delicati nelle acque rivali. E, ovviamente, si dedicano alla raccolta di dati.

**Author:** Joe Brock  
**Published Date:** March 24, 2023  

SINGAPORE, March 24 (Reuters) - It started out as strictly business: a huge private contract for one of the world’s most advanced undersea fiber-optic cables. It became a trophy in a growing proxy war between the United States and China over technologies that could determine who achieves economic and military dominance for decades to come.

In February, American subsea cable company SubCom LLC began laying a $600-million cable to transport data from Asia to Europe, via Africa and the Middle East, at super-fast speeds over 12,000 miles of fiber running along the seafloor.

That cable is known as South East Asia–Middle East–Western Europe 6, or SeaMeWe-6 for short. It will connect a dozen countries as it snakes its way from Singapore to France, crossing three seas and the Indian Ocean on the way. It is slated to be finished in 2025.

It was a project that slipped through China’s fingers.

A Chinese company that has quickly emerged as a force in the subsea cable-building industry - HMN Technologies Co Ltd - was on the brink of snagging that contract three years ago. The client for the cable was a consortium of more than a dozen global firms. Three of China’s state-owned carriers - China Telecommunications Corporation (China Telecom), China Mobile Limited and China United Network Communications Group Co Ltd (China Unicom) - had committed funding as members of the consortium, which also included U.S.-based Microsoft Corp and French telecom firm Orange SA, according to six people involved in the deal.

HMN Tech, whose predecessor company was majority-owned by Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, was selected in early 2020 to manufacture and lay the cable, the people said, due in part to hefty subsidies from Beijing that lowered the cost. HMN Tech’s bid of $500 million was roughly a third cheaper than the initial proposal submitted to the cable consortium by New Jersey-based SubCom, the people said.

The Singapore-to-France cable would have been HMN Tech’s biggest such project to date, cementing it as the world’s fastest-rising subsea cable builder, and extending the global reach of the three Chinese telecom firms that had intended to invest in it.

But the U.S. government, concerned about the potential for Chinese spying on these sensitive communications cables, ran a successful campaign to flip the contract to SubCom through incentives and pressure on consortium members.

Reuters has detailed that effort here for the first time. It’s one of at least six private undersea cable deals in the Asia-Pacific region over the past four years where the U.S. government either intervened to keep HMN Tech from winning that business, or forced the rerouting or abandonment of cables that would have directly linked U.S. and Chinese territories. The story of those interventions by Washington hasn’t been previously reported.

SubCom had no comment on the SeaMeWe-6 battle, and HMN Tech did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement last year about infrastructure projects, the White House briefly noted that the U.S. government helped SubCom to win the Singapore-to-France cable contract, without giving details. China’s foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment. China Telecom, China Mobile, China Unicom and Orange did not respond to requests for comment. Microsoft declined to comment.

Undersea cables are central to U.S.-China technology competition.

Across the globe, there are more than 400 cables running along the seafloor, carrying over 95% of all international internet traffic, according to TeleGeography, a Washington-based telecommunications research firm. These data conduits, which transmit everything from emails and banking transactions to military secrets, are vulnerable to sabotage attacks and espionage, a U.S. government official and two security analysts told Reuters.

The potential for undersea cables to be drawn into a conflict between China and self-ruled Taiwan was thrown into sharp relief last month. Two communications cables were cut that connected Taiwan with its Matsu islands, which sit close to the Chinese coast. The islands’ 14,000 residents were disconnected from the internet.

Taiwanese authorities said they suspected a Chinese fishing vessel and a Chinese freighter caused the disruption. However, they stopped short of calling it a deliberate act and said there was no direct evidence showing the Chinese ships were to blame. China, which considers Taiwan a breakaway province, has ratcheted up military and political efforts to force the island to accept its dominion.

Eavesdropping is a worry too. Spy agencies can readily tap into cables landing on their territory. Justin Sherman, a fellow at the Cyber Statecraft Initiative of the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank, told Reuters that undersea cables were “a surveillance gold mine” for the world’s intelligence agencies.

“When we talk about U.S.-China tech competition, when we talk about espionage and the capture of data, submarine cables are involved in every aspect of those rising geopolitical tensions,” Sherman said.

Two of the projects upended by the U.S. government involved cables that had already been manufactured and laid thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean. U.S. tech behemoths Google LLC, Meta Platforms Inc and Amazon.com Inc were major investors in at least one, or in Meta’s case both, of those cables, according to public announcements made about the projects. The delays and rerouting of the cables cost each of those companies tens of millions of dollars in lost revenue and additional costs, four sources who worked on the projects said.

Amazon, Meta and Google declined to comment about these projects or the cable wars.

SubCom’s cable coup is part of a wider effort in Washington aimed at reining in China as Beijing strives to become the world's dominant producer of advanced technologies, be it submarines, semiconductor chips, artificial intelligence or drones. China is bulking up its military arsenal with sophisticated armaments. And Beijing has become increasingly assertive about countering U.S. influence worldwide through trade, weapons and infrastructure deals that are drawing wide swaths of the globe into its orbit.

The U.S. cable effort has been anchored by a three-year-old interagency task force informally known as Team Telecom.

To oust the Chinese builder from the Singapore-to-France cable, the United States proffered sweeteners - and warnings - to the project’s investors.

On the sweetener side, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) told Reuters it offered training grants valued at a total of $3.8 million to five telecom companies in countries on the cable’s route in return for them choosing SubCom as the supplier. Telecom Egypt and Network i2i Limited, a company owned by India’s Bharti Airtel Limited, got $1 million apiece, USTDA said. Djibouti Telecom, Sri Lanka Telecom and Dhivehi Raajjeyge Gulhun of the Maldives each received $600,000. None of the five responded to questions from Reuters.

Meanwhile, American diplomats cautioned participating foreign telecom carriers that Washington planned to impose crippling sanctions on HMN Tech, a development that could put their investment in the cable project at risk. The U.S. Commerce Department made good on that threat in December 2021, citing HMN Tech’s intention to acquire American technology to help modernize China’s People’s Liberation Army.

A senior U.S. State Department official confirmed that the department had advocated through its embassies to help SubCom win the contract, including warning other countries about the security risks posed by HMN Tech. Though the cable won’t come ashore in Chinese territory, the U.S. government believed HMN Tech could insert remote surveillance equipment inside the cable, the official said without providing evidence. The Commerce Department declined to comment.

Two months later, in February 2022, SubCom announced that the cable consortium had awarded it the contract to build the SeaMeWe-6 cable. China Telecom and China Mobile, which were due to own a combined 20% of the cable, pulled out because the Chinese government wouldn’t approve their involvement in the project with SubCom as the cable contractor, three people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. China Unicom remained.

China’s foreign ministry and its defense ministry, which handles questions for the People’s Liberation Army, did not respond to Reuters’ questions.

On June 26, 2022, the White House published a fact sheet citing various upcoming infrastructure projects, including the SubCom undersea cable deal. The document said the U.S. government had “collectively helped secure” the award of that contract for SubCom.

The White House did not respond to a request for further comment.

**TENSIONS RISING**  

U.S.-China relations are at the lowest they’ve been in decades. The two countries have clashed on a host of issues, including China’s tacit support for Russia’s invasion of democratic Ukraine, its crackdown on Hong Kong, and the future of Taiwan, which Chinese President Xi Jinping has pledged to bring under Beijing’s control. In February, the United States shot down a Chinese spy balloon that floated into American airspace. China has claimed it was a weather balloon that got blown off course and accused the Americans of overreacting.

President Joe Biden’s policies are increasingly isolating China’s high-tech sector with the aim of bringing some technology manufacturing back to America while keeping cutting-edge U.S. innovation out of Chinese hands.

Over the last year, the Biden administration has pushed through a landmark bill to provide $52.7 billion in subsidies for U.S. semiconductor production and research. The Commerce Department in December added dozens of Chinese firms producing technology such as drones and artificial intelligence chips to its so-called Entity List, which severely restricts their access to U.S. technology.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, including specific incidents of cable cuts, such as those affecting Taiwan, and the geopolitical implications of these actions.

Nave de război şi submarine patrulează tot mai agresiv în regiunea în care se află cablurile de internet ale americanilor. Iar pericolul cel mare îl reprezintă, potrivit The New York Times, nava specială rusească Yantar, care se îndreaptă spre Cuba şi ar fi fost observată recent în regiunea Caraibilor, nu foarte departe de coastele Statelor Unite, adică exact pe-acolo pe unde trec cele mai multe cabluri submarine.

„Scopul ruşilor este de a umili Statele Unite şi a demonstra că nu se pot apăra şi să îşi proiecteze puterea militară în Oceanul Atlantic pentru a spune Statelor Unite şi Europei: Suntem aici, trebuie să acceptaţi acest lucru şi să ne luaţi în serios pentru că reprezentăm o ameninţare pentru cele mai vitale interese ale voastre”, este de părere Stephen Blank, expert militar.

Prin urmare, nu doar Statele Unite sunt amenințate de eventuala piratare sau chiar de tăierea cablurilor submarine de internet, ci şi Europa. Un asemenea scenariu s-ar traduce printr-o veritabilă criză a comunicaţiilor. Ar fi o situaţie care ar pune în pericol legăturile de afaceri de pe bătrânul continent.

Experţii consideră că, în cazul în care izbucneşte un conflict şi mai serios între Rusia şi Occident, navele ruseşti ar putea intercepta comunicaţiile speciale prin ataşarea unui dispozitiv de cablurile submarine.

„Aceste cabluri sunt extrem de vitale, sunt miezul sistemului infrastructurii noastre de comunicaţii. Auzim tot felul de discuţii despre Cloud, de exemplu, şi ne gândim că este ceva pe cer. De fapt, cloud-ul este sub ocean”, explică Jonathan Hjembo, expert în comunicaţii.

Şi nu este vorba despre un singur cablu suboceanic, între Europa şi Statele Unite, ci de câteva sute. Iar dacă, oficial, Washingtonul nu este în alertă, ţările europene sunt îngrijorate de activitatea militară a ruşilor.

Un diplomat european a declarat că nivelul de acum al armatei ruse este comparabil cu cel din perioada războiului rece.

HÀ NỘI — The undersea Asia-America Gateway (AAG) internet cable – one of the six cables connecting Việt Nam with the rest of the world – has ruptured since Tuesday morning.

This is the fifth time the cable has broken this year, slowing down internet speed in the country.

According to internet service providers (ISPs), the breakage occurred at a cable branch from HCM City.

The ISPs said rupture of the AAG is a common occurrence and service providers can immediately deploy backup plans to ensure internet speed is maintained for the APEC Summit in Đà Nẵng and for its customers.

The AAG has a total length of 20,000km and a designed minimum design capacity of 1.28 terrabits per second, connecting Southeast Asia with the United States.

By 2016, the AAG cable was responsible for 60 per cent of Việt Nam’s internet traffic. Most ISPs in the country make use of this cable.

In addition, another submarine international internet cable -- Southeast Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 3 (SEA-ME-WE3) -- is also experiencing difficulties and has not been repaired.

A statement from Hong Kong telecom HGC Global Communications says as much as 25% of the traffic in the areas has been impacted. The company is currently rerouting traffic to keep disruptions to a minimum and “extending assistance to affected businesses.”

There are more than 15 undersea internet cables in the Red Sea. To have four damaged at a single time is ”exceptionally rare,” HGC said in a separate earlier statement.

The disruption of the cables did not disconnect any country from the internet, but the Wall Street Journal reports service in India, Pakistan, and parts of East Africa was noticeably degraded.

No services have yet offered a reason for the cuts. Yemen’s telecom ministry denied speculation it was responsible for the failures, saying it was “keen to keep all telecom submarine cables…away from any possible risks.”

Underwater cables are responsible for most of the internet’s data traffic. They’re cheaper than land-based cables, but are prone to damage from ships’ anchors.

The ongoing conflict in the Middle East has experts wondering about the timing and severity of this outage, though. Iran-based Houthi has been particularly aggressive in the Red Sea, including in mid-February when a cargo ship was abandoned by its crew following an Houthi attack. The ship, which had weighed anchor, drifted for weeks before sinking.

Houthi control of the region and the ongoing strife in Yemen makes repairing the damaged cables more complicated. One of the four companies affected said it expects to start that process early in the second quarter, though permit issues, weather, and the civil war in that country could impact that.","The article titled ""Internet cables cut in the Red Sea in 'exceptionally rare' incident, disrupting much of Asia, Europe, and the Middle East"" directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables.

**Internet Outages & Trends**  
Having a complete understanding of the situation and associated service delivery chain is crucial for effective incident response, as any missing information can lead to misdiagnosing the problem.  
To assure quality digital experiences, one strategy, of course, is to use system logs, context, and triangulation to try to de-risk the “unknowns” that can degrade or take out your networks, applications, or services.

In the past fortnight, engineering and ops teams at OpenAI and PlayHQ seem to have encountered some of these unknowns.  
OpenAI appeared to live-test an unknown by manually diverting traffic from a degraded infrastructure cluster to a healthy cluster—which did not completely work as intended. PlayHQ, meanwhile, appeared to have seen an unknown issue that had been dormant since January suddenly impact application availability.

On a related note, this fortnight, Microsoft revisited Azure problems caused by cable cuts in Africa. In Microsoft’s case, their issues related to an apparent “known unknown”—what might happen in a perfect storm if all four redundancy options they had in place were out simultaneously. Given the anomalous nature of that occurring, this would have remained a “known unknown” in their operational environment for some time until the cable cuts happened. What’s interesting, though, is what they did to find extra capacity for their South African sites when they sought to mitigate capacity concerns.

"Subsea Cable Maintenance and Its Effects on Cloud Connectivity","Analyzes a shunt fault incident affecting the Sea-Me-We-5 and IMEWE cables, revealing significant impacts on internet latency for cloud services.","https://www.kentik.com/blog/cloud-observer-subsea-cable-maintenance-impacts-cloud-connectivity","","Doug Madory",Yes,"Doug Madory","San Francisco, CA, USA","10000","2023-11-28","English","Kentik","In this edition of the Cloud Observer, we dig into the impacts of recent submarine cable maintenance on intercontinental cloud connectivity and call for the greater transparency from the submarine cable industry about incidents which cause critical cables to be taken out of service.

In recent weeks, two of the internet’s major submarine cable systems were down for repairs, impacting internet traffic between Europe and Asia. As we’ve pointed out in the past, the major public clouds rely on the same submarine cable infrastructure as us regular internet users, so when a cable incident occurs, cloud connectivity is also affected.

In this edition of the Cloud Observer, we’ll take a look at what we observed when Sea-Me-We-5 (SMW-5) and IMEWE were recently down for repairs.

The Cloud Observer is a recurring series focused on analyzing inter-regional cloud connectivity. These posts utilize Kentik’s continuous measurements between our agents in over 110 cloud regions in the world’s largest cloud providers: AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Configured in a full mesh, these agents perform ping and traceroute tests to every other agent providing a continuous picture of interconnectivity within the cloud.

Sea-Me-We-5’s name is an acronym that traces the geographic path the cable takes: Southeast Asia (SEA), Middle East (ME), Western Europe (WE). It was designated as ‘ready for service’ (RFS) in 2016 and is the fifth edition of a consortium-owned intercontinental submarine fiber optic cable carrying a large portion of the internet traffic between Europe and Asia.

As I described in a brief post last month, at 00:00 UTC on October 23, SMW-5, the major submarine cable connecting Asia to Europe, was taken down to repair a shunt fault. A shunt fault occurs when sea water breaches the cable’s insulation, causing a short circuit in the cable’s electrical feed.

Submarine cables contain an electrical system that carries thousands of volts of electricity to power the amplifiers (often referred to as repeaters) that are placed every 70 km or so to maintain signal strength. Normally, a cable can continue operating despite suffering a shunt fault, but must be repaired as soon as possible.

My friend Philippe Devaux describes himself as “a keen observer of the global submarine cable systems industry” and has a knack for piercing through the secretive world of submarine cables (occasionally reaching the ship crews themselves) to find insiders willing to confirm details of submarine cable repairs.

In a recent LinkedIn post for the SMW-5 repairs, he identified the cable ship (CS) Asean Restorer as the vessel performing the repairs of the shunt fault disrupting Europe-to-Asia internet traffic.

The loss of the major route between Asia and Europe was picked up on the latency measurements between our agents in cloud regions. Numerous routes experienced latency increases of around 40 ms. The criticality of SMW-5 was evident as all three major public clouds experienced latency changes due to the loss of the cable. Let’s take a look at some of the impacts caught in Kentik’s cloud measurements.

The impacts for AWS and GCP revealed a stable shift in latency, likely owing to a longer geographic path while SMW-5 was undergoing repairs. Alternatively, the measurements involving the Azure regions showed periodic latency increases that align with work days, as pictured below. This may suggest that Azure would shift a portion of its traffic to a longer path only during busy working hours.

And, of course, it wouldn’t be a submarine cable analysis without providing an example of a case when latencies improved due to the loss of a submarine cable. The graphic below illustrates the impact of the loss of SMW-5 on the latencies from AWS’s eu-west-3 in Paris to Azure’s uaenorth in Dubai — a drop from 114ms to 90ms.

Why would latency drop as a result of the loss of a submarine cable? I addressed this in my blog post from August about the submarine cable cuts off the west coast of Africa:

While this may seem counterintuitive, this is a phenomenon I have often encountered when analyzing submarine cable cuts... Essentially a higher latency route becomes unavailable, and traffic is forced to go a more direct path. Why would traffic be using the higher latency path in the first place? What you can’t see in these visualizations are factors like cost.

In that example, latencies between Cape Town and Seoul dropped when the WACS cable was cut and AWS had to redirect traffic over a more direct path through the Indian Ocean. In that case, there simply may not be a business case to justify paying a premium to ensure the lowest latency between those two distant locations.

That logic would seem to hold less weight in the case of latencies between Dubai and Paris. Network engineers in the Middle East typically try to optimize latencies to Europe, the main source of global transit for the region. In this case, we’re looking at a traffic handoff between two clouds (AWS and Azure). As we will explore in future posts in this series, it is not uncommon to find suboptimal latencies between two clouds each operated by a different networking team with its own interconnection strategy.

Similar to SMW-5, IMEWE’s name derives from its route, heading east to west: India (I), Middle East (ME), Western Europe (WE) and was RFS in 2010. In a talk I gave at MENOG in Muscat, Oman in 2011, I presented evidence of IMEWE’s activation for the country of Lebanon.

In a LinkedIn post, Phillippe Devaux again identified the vessel performing the repair as the cable ship (CS) Maram, presently in the Gulf of Aden. Phillippe added:

CS Maram departed Salalah 27OCT23, currently positioned about 60km off Aden, where she has been mostly stationary since 03NOV23, likely busy repairing IMEWE fault. (ETR Expected Time to Repair: 12NOV23)

We could see the impacts of this cable maintenance in a couple of places in our tools. Latency between AWS’s eu-south-1 in Milan and me-south-1 in Manama, Bahrain, dropped by 31ms during the IMEWE outage.

Additionally, Kentik Market Intelligence (KMI) reported impacts, including the loss and subsequent return of transit from Telecom Italia Sparkle (AS6762) for Pakistani incumbent PTCL (AS17557).

Below is a visualization from transit data from KMI over time showing the disappearance of AS6762 in peach on November 2nd, followed by an increase in transit from TMnet (AS4788 in maroon) before seeing a return of AS6762 transit for AS17557 on the 10th.

Incidentally, I have a connection to the cable ship performing this repair. At a submarine cable conference in 2016, the event provided a tour of the newly christened CS Maram docked in Dubai. Below is a picture of me in the bay of the CS Maram in front of a QTrencher 400, a massive remotely operated vehicle (ROV) for subsea trenching and cable maintenance.

Submarine cables require regular maintenance and repair, and as I mentioned in my post about the submarine cable cuts in Africa: the seafloor can be a dangerous place for cables.

The loss of submarine cable connectivity can have profound impacts on the international flow of internet traffic, but unfortunately, the submarine cable industry isn’t communicative to the general public on events like this, and this is a problem. Typically, cable operators only report downtime and outages to their direct customers. If those customers fail to notify a broader audience, the general public is left to speculate on the causes of internet outages.

In 2017, I wrote a blog post about Telecom Heroics in Somalia, which told the story of how the ISPs in Mogadishu faced down a terrorist threat to activate their first submarine cable landing. In that piece, I also covered an incident where the lack of communication from a cable operator could have gotten people hurt.","The article discusses the maintenance and repair of submarine cables, specifically the Sea-Me-We-5 and IMEWE cables.

Less than a month since the last troubleshooting was completed, the Asia America Gateway (AAG) submarine cable is now broken down again, substantially obstructing Vietnamese netizens’ international connection.  

Internet service providers (ISPs) in Vietnam have confirmed that the submarine cable system faced an issue on May 14, causing Internet speed in the country to be disrupted.  

A representative of a domestic ISP said all connections through the AAG system have been redirected through other systems to minimize the connection latency for users.  

The cable system is notorious for its high frequency of recesses throughout the year.  

The latest maintenance on the AAG cable system was completed less than a month ago, on April 21.  

**E-mail, Facebook barely loading**  

Duy Tung from Ho Chi Minh City has quite a few complaints about the sluggish Internet speed over the last few days.  

""Gmail takes a while to open and even longer if there are attachments. Even Messenger continually reports failure to deliver messages. Most services with foreign hostings are slow these days,"" Tung said, referring to Google’s email service and Facebook’s chat app.  

Hong Uyen from District 5 in the southern metropolis also finds the speed bump disrupting her daily work.  

Her job requires engagements in virtual conferences, to which the slightest fluctuation in Internet bandwidth can make a vexing experience.  

""The average meeting lasts 30 to 60 minutes, yet the choppy Internet may drag it out twice as long. Everyone is frustrated at the bandwidth problem,"" Uyen said.  

According to customer feedback, the download speed of international services has significantly worsened, affecting work operations of various firms as well as general usage of the Vietnamese public.  

""Our company is [letting employees] work from home via online tools, yet the Internet speed has halted many meetings. The work progress is naturally hindered, which causes us a great deal of frustration,"" Uyen said.  

A run of the Speedtest tool provided by the Vietnam Internet Network Information Center (VNNIC) to measure the Internet speed of a local ISP by _Tuoi Tre_ (Youth) newspaper on Monday afternoon showed both upload and download speeds hovered around 10Mbps.  

Another ISP returned a result of 20Mbps, which is much lower than the average of 61.69Mbps for fixed broadband Internet services of Vietnam announced by VNNIC in April.  

**The endless loop of cable disruption**  

The AAG is a 20,000-kilometer submarine communications cable system connecting Southeast Asia with the U.S. mainland across the Pacific Ocean via Guam and Hawaii.  

It was put into operation in November 2009.  

The segment connecting to Vietnam is 314 kilometers long and strikes land in Vung Tau City in the southern region, delivering up to two terabits per second.  

The AAG system holds an extensive track record on international connection issues and has been blamed for many occasions where Internet speed slumped in Vietnam.  

In November and December 2019, a malfunction in the system was detected and was not completely fixed until late January.  

The cable went on to break down again in February, affecting domestic Internet speed until the problem was resolved in March.  

IA and AAE-1, two other international Internet cable lines employed by Vietnamese ISPs, have exhibited the same pattern of issues.  

Both faced problems since late 2019 and did not return to normalcy until early February.  

Despite the ISPs’ claims of backup mechanisms in place regarding AAG malfunctions, the recent instances of Internet interruption speak volumes about the still-prominence status of the AAG cable system to Vietnamese users.","The article discusses the breakdown of the AAG submarine cable, detailing the frequency of disruptions and their impact on internet speed in Vietnam.

Web pages loading slowly? A submarine fibre-optic cable fault between Perth and Singapore could be why.

Australia's second largest DSL internet service provider iiNet is among a number of Australian providers [affected by the issue](http://www.iinet.net.au/status/fault.php?id=3669107) that started on the [SEA-ME-WE 3 cable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEA-ME-WE_3) on Sunday.

SEA-ME-WE-3's route.

""Our link between Perth and Singapore is currently not passing traffic,"" an iiNet spokesman told Fairfax Media. ""This traffic is taking an alternate path via Sydney to Hong Kong.

As a result, iiNet said customers may experience slower than expected download and upload speeds, latency and packet-loss to destinations in Asia.

""This may result in web pages taking longer to load, as well as impact to time-sensitive activities such as online gaming to servers in Asia.""

Low latency impacts real-time communications and response times including payment and sale transactions, programs like Skype and fast-reaction applications like video games.

Although providers who use [SEA-ME-WE 3](http://www.submarinecablemap.com/#/submarine-cable/seamewe-3) — which has a maximum capacity of 480 gigabits per second — were sent a notification about the fault on Sunday, no timeframe has been given for a fix.

It's not the first time the 39,000-kilometre cable has had a fault. When it was severed in January 2013 it took approximately four months to repair. This was due to delays in obtaining permits from Indonesian authorities.

The cable also suffered from [a major fault in 2005](http://www.smh.com.au/news/breaking/communication-breakdown-in-pakistan/2005/06/29/1119724673577.html) that affected approximately 10 million internet users and almost all communications going in and out of Pakistan.

It's unclear as yet what caused the latest fault. An earthquake and a ship's anchor are thought to have been the reason for past issues.

Kuo",Yes,"Mercy A. Kuo","Arlington, Virginia, USA.","15000","2025-01-28","English","Diplomat Media Inc.","**China’s Undersea Cable Sabotage**  
**Author:** Mercy A. Kuo  
**Published Date:** 01/28/2025  

In a recent incident, a Chinese-owned cargo vessel, Shunxing-39, cut undersea fiber-optic cables near Taiwan’s Keelung Harbor. What does this signal to Taipei?  

The employment of third-country flagged cargo vessels to carry out undersea cable and pipeline sabotage operations appears to be a new element in Beijing’s ongoing gray zone warfare against Taiwan. China is exploiting the weaknesses in Taiwan’s position as an island nation dependent on maritime commerce and communications, while hiding behind commercial ships flying so-called “flags-of-convenience” (such as Tanzania and Cameroon) to deflect blame.

**Analyze the intentions behind Chinese vessels’ cutting undersea cables in the Baltic Sea in November last year.**  

What we appear to be seeing is a growing Russia-China gray zone collaboration, perhaps moving in the direction of a full-fledged “axis.” Beijing can surreptitiously aid Moscow in its far-away European fight, which adds one more layer of deniability to the attribution of responsibility. Likewise, we have seen indications of Russian-ported vessels conducting suspicious activities off of Taiwan’s coast.

**Examine undersea cable sabotage as an emerging trend in China’s gray zone warfare.**  

China continues to expand its already vast gray zone toolkit, having long ago calculated that its willingness to blur the lines between peace and hostilities provides it with an asymmetric advantage. Previously unheard of activities – such as turning lonely reefs into major South China Sea military bases; employing fishing vessels as paramilitary forces; or surveying and patrolling other nations’ waters as a means of expanding sovereign claims – are examples of how Beijing wins in the gray zone while its adversaries are still trying to diagnose the problem within their neat categories of laws and norms.

With China’s coastline ringed by U.S. partners and allies, China has determined to attack their natural vulnerabilities as island nations. Cable and pipeline sabotage is more than mere harassment; it is a reminder that Beijing has the ability to cause far more damage to its enemies, should it choose to do so. This adds to its coercive power over those countries as it seeks regional hegemony.

**How can targeted countries of cable sabotage pre-empt and mitigate future risks?**  

Subsea cables are especially vulnerable to sabotage or even exploitation, as they are extremely long, difficult to monitor, and unprotected against a determined adversary. If nothing else, these events should alert governments and private-sector providers that the seabed is no longer insulated from malign actors.

This will put a premium on hardening subsea cables and pipelines, which will make them more expensive to manufacture and deploy. It will also require governments to invest in much more sophisticated undersea surveillance systems, and in building redundant delivery methods so that any one break doesn’t cripple an entire economy.

**Assess China’s undersea cable sabotage strategy in the broader context of China-U.S. strategic rivalry.**  

What we are witnessing is a much more brazen Beijing now employing full-spectrum gray zone tactics behind vanishingly thin facades of opacity or deniability. China seems much less concerned about reputational costs, calculating that any international outrage will be limited and manageable.

This reflects both its strategy and its experience. China’s experience has been that international outrage is fleeting and of minimal real cost, while its strategy is to normalize increasingly aggressive behavior so that lower levels of aggression become routine and barely noted. We’ve seen this play out across many domains, including in the air, on or under the sea, in cyberspace, and through lawfare. So accustomed has the world become to it that incidents that used to generate headlines now barely receive public mention.","The article titled 'China’s Undersea Cable Sabotage' discusses specific incidents of undersea cable cutting, particularly an incident involving the vessel Shunxing-39 cutting cables near Taiwan.

**Author:** Les Cottrell  
**Published Date:** 07/19/2023  

### Introduction  
On January 31st, 2008, the NY Times, BBC, The Guardian, CNN and many others reported undersea cable cuts in the Mediterranean. There is also a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). One cable was damaged near Alexandria, Egypt, and another in the waters off Marseille, France. The two cables were damaged within hours of each other on Wednesday morning of January 30th 2008. Operators believe the damage was caused by ship's anchors during a heavy storm at sea. One of the cables, Sea Me We 4, is owned by 16 telecommunications companies along its route. The second cable, known as the Flag (for Fiber-optic Link Around the Globe) System, runs from Britain to Japan. The outages mainly affected the Middle East and Asia.  

### Investigation  
We decided to look at the impact on Internet connectivity as seen by the PingER project measurements seen from SLAC (near San Francisco in California). These are simple ping echo measurements of Round Trip Time (RTT), Loss, jitter etc.  

#### Table 1: Hourly Ping Losses  
**Country** | **Loss before** | **Loss after** | **Sites affected / total**  
Sudan | < 4.5% | >15% | 3/3  
Bahrein | 0% | >10% | 2/2  
UAE | <4.5% | >20% | 1/1  
...  

#### Table 2: Daily Ping Losses  
**Country** | **Loss before** | **Loss after** | **Sites affected / total**  
Egypt | <1% | >7.5% | 3/3  
Sudan | <5% | >30% | 3/3  
...  

The differences between the daily and hourly tables may reflect the sites/countries abilities to switch to alternate routes.  

### Conclusion  
The article provides a comprehensive overview of the impact of the fibre outage, including detailed data and analysis of internet connectivity effects across various countries.","The article titled 'Effects of Fibre Outage through Mediterranean - Internet End-to-End Performance Monitoring' discusses the incident of undersea cable cuts that occurred on January 30, 2008, affecting the Sea Me We 4 and Flag System cables.

The Chinese ships’ illegal moves in the waters inside **Vietnam’s Exclusive Economic Zone and Continental Shelf** near the Tu Chinh – Vung May (Vanguard Bank – Rifleman Bank) region since July 3 until now has compromised energy security and the free energy market in the short and long run.

**Impact on oil supply**

The East Vietnam Sea potentially has vast resources of oil and gas. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that the sea ""contains approximately 11 billion barrels of oil and 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in proved and probable reserves."" And the Vanguard Bank is located in an area rich in these natural resources, to the west of Vietnam’s Truong Sa (Spratly) archipelago.

The reserves can meet the rising demand for energy in Southeast Asia.

Benjamin Sovacool, director of the Danish Center for Energy Technology, wrote that in the Asia-Pacific region demand for energy was projected to grow 2.4 percent (against a global average of 1.5 percent) and reliance on oil would rise from 57.5 percent to 66.4 percent between 2005 and 2030.

During the past decade, Vietnam has become an important producer of oil in Southeast Asia. Vietnam has sped up the exploration of oil sources, allowed foreign energy companies to pour in more investments, and cooperated with them in tapping its resources.

However, China’s efforts to disrupt and hinder relevant parties’ oil and gas activities, especially Vietnam’s, in the East Vietnam Sea will adversely affect oil supply and energy security in the region.

China has tried every way to interfere with Vietnam’s oil and gas exploration, from cutting its survey ship’s cables to pressuring the country and obstructing the implementation of its exploitation agreements.

Most recently, China has sent the survey ship Haiyang Dizhi 8 and the heavily armed Coast Guard vessel 35111 to carry out provocative actions around Japan’s oil rig Hakuryu-5 at Block 06-01 belonging to the Nam Con Son Basin project, Vietnam’s joint venture with Russia, which is proof of the Chinese side’s destructive behaviors and which could cause consequences for the oil supply of Vietnam as well as the region.

**Obstructing oil transport route**

Not only is Vietnam’s oil supply seriously disrupted but the probability of a conflict would threaten maritime routes, particularly the shipping of oil through the region.

The East Vietnam Sea is part of the world’s arterial waterway connecting the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. Over 200 ships sail through the Malacca Strait every day, translating into 63,000 vessels a year, which transport 80 percent of the oil shipped to Northeast Asia. The shipments are estimated to amount to 525 million metric tons, worth a combined US$390 billion.

Besides, estimates show that Asia’s crude oil imports will rise to 31 million barrels a day in 2030 from 19 million barrels a day in 2014.

Ships from Japan, Australia, China, South Korea and Southeast Asian countries would have to take a detour around the South Australia route, leading to a five-fold transport cost.

This means regional countries will likely face an energy crisis if there is any hindrance to maritime routes. Soaring energy demand and shipping costs would cause oil prices to fluctuate, which would in turn affect the free oil market.

Statistics indicate the importance of maintaining peace and security in the East Vietnam Sea to ensure stable oil supply and smooth shipping routes. Any detrimental effect on the aforementioned activities would disturb the demand and supply balance of the regional energy system.

Therefore, it is critical that China stop all disruptive actions, withdraw all ships from the Vietnamese waters, and refrain from any escalation that may elevate the risk of a regional energy crisis.

TTO - Trong khi sự cố trên tuyến cáp quang biển AAG vẫn chưa được khắc phục, lại thêm tuyến APG đứt, gây ảnh hưởng rất lớn đến tốc độ kết nối Internet Việt Nam đi quốc tế.

Theo thông tin từ một số nhà mạng viễn thông, tuyến cáp quang biển quốc tế APG (Asia Pacific Gateway) lại gặp sự cố vào ngày 23-5. Toàn bộ lưu lượng kết nối Internet từ Việt Nam đi quốc tế trên tuyến này đều mất sạch.

Kết hợp với sự cố trên tuyến cáp AAG vẫn chưa được sửa chữa, khiến tốc độ truy cập Internet Việt Nam đi quốc tế bị ảnh hưởng nặng nề.

Theo tìm hiểu của Tuổi Trẻ Online, nhiều người dùng gần như không thể truy cập Facebook, Gmail, YouTube. Người sử dụng được phải kiên trì chờ tải khá lâu.

Theo thông tin từ các nhà mạng, nguyên nhân sự cố trên tuyến cáp APG vẫn đang chờ xác định. Kế hoạch sửa chữa, khắc phục sẽ được đối tác quốc tế thông báo trong thời gian tới.

Cáp quang APG được đưa vào vận hành từ cuối năm 2016, có khả năng cung cấp băng thông tối đa lên tới 54 Tbps. Tuyến cáp này có chiều dài khoảng 10.400km được đặt ngầm dưới biển Thái Bình Dương.

Cáp có điểm kết nối ở Trung Quốc, Hong Kong, Đài Loan, Nhật Bản, Hàn Quốc, Malaysia, Singapore, Thái Lan và Việt Nam.

Ngay sau khi phát hiện tuyến cáp quang biển APG gặp sự cố, các nhà mạng đã triển khai phương án để điều chuyển lưu lượng sang các hướng cáp đất liền và cáp biển khác.

Tuy nhiên theo ghi nhận, việc cả hai tuyến cáp quan trọng là APG và AAG cùng lúc gặp sự cố khiến người dùng gặp nhiều khó khăn khi vào mạng, đặc biệt là khi truy cập vào các dịch vụ nước ngoài như Facebook, Gmail, Netflix...

Vào ngày 14-5, tuyến cáp quang biển AAG gặp sự cố lần thứ hai trong năm 2020, gây ảnh hưởng chất lượng dịch vụ Internet quốc tế trên tuyến. Nguyên nhân được xác định là do lỗi cáp trên nhánh S1H, đoạn kết nối từ Việt Nam đi Hong Kong, với vị trí cách trạm cập bờ Vũng Tàu 107,7km.

AAG là tuyến cáp quang biển có tổng chiều dài 20.191km, được đưa vào khai thác từ tháng 11-2009. Tuyến cáp này kết nối trực tiếp khu vực Đông Nam Á với Mỹ; đi qua Malaysia (Mersing), Singapore (Changi), Thái Lan (Sri Racha), Việt Nam (nhánh cáp rẽ vào Việt Nam dài 314km, điểm cập bờ tại Vũng Tàu), Brunei (Tungku), Hong Kong (Nam Lantau), Philippines (Currimao) và Hoa Kỳ (Guam, Hawaii và California).

"Geopolitical Tensions Over Undersea Internet Cables","27 cable cuts in five years raise concerns over internet security and military implications amid rising tensions with China.","https://www.voanews.com/a/tensions-with-china-emerge-over-undersea-cables-carrying-internet-traffic/7027809.html","","Xiaoshan Xue, Adrianna Zhang",Yes,"Xiaoshan Xue, Adrianna Zhang","Washington, D.C.","3260000","2023-03-29","Mandarin","Voice of America (VOA)","**Title:** Tensions With China Emerge Over Undersea Cables Carrying Internet Traffic  
**Authors:** Xiaoshan Xue, Adrianna Zhang  
**Published Date:** 03/29/2023  

Undersea cables that carry the bulk of intercontinental internet traffic are increasingly the focal point of geopolitical tensions involving China, according to experts.

Justin Sherman, a fellow at the Cyber Statecraft Initiative of the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank, told Reuters, ""When we talk about U.S.-China tech competition, when we talk about espionage and the capture of data, submarine cables are involved in every aspect of those rising geopolitical tensions.""

The cables are a hot spot in China's relations with Taiwan, a self-governing island that Beijing considers its own territory — a long-standing point of contention between the U.S. and China.

VOA Mandarin contacted the Chinese Embassy in Washington and the Foreign Ministry in Beijing asking for a comment but was told the Chinese government had no comment on undersea cables.

Last month, the cables were [cut between Taiwan and the Matsu Islands](https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/taiwan-blames-chinese-ships-for-cutting-internet-cables/6996236.html), which are controlled by Taiwan but lie just off the coast of China. Taiwan's government stopped short of accusing the Chinese government of cutting the cables on purpose, and the National Communications Commission said [two ships severed the cables accidentally](https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202302160022).

The cables have been cut 27 times during the past five years, according to data from Taiwan's Chungwha Telecom quoted by [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/matsu-taiwan-internet-cables-cut-china-65f10f5f73a346fa788436366d7a7c70). Each cable is [about as wide as a garden hose](https://www2.telegeography.com/submarine-cable-faqs-frequently-asked-questions) once the fiber-optic technology inside is wrapped with insulating materials so it can be laid on the seabed, where it is exposed to threats including earthquakes, typhoons, ships' anchors and saboteurs.

Elisabeth Braw, a senior researcher at the American Enterprise Institute, speculated in a February 21 article in _[Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/02/21/matsu-islands-internet-cables-china-taiwan/)_ magazine that the cut cables may be the result of targeted harassment of Taiwan by China.

She told VOA Mandarin that over the past few years, ""Chinese fishing vessels and other commercial vessels have been harming the cables connecting the Matsu islands to Taiwan a disproportionate number of times. … And the challenge for Taiwan is that it's not a military attack.

""And China can say, 'Oh, it was just commercial vessels,' and they didn't deliberately harm or cut the cables. And it's impossible for Taiwan to prove that it was deliberate. And so it's very hard to retaliate, and it's also very hard to protect those cables. You can't have your navy out 24 hours a day just sitting on top of the cables to make sure nobody harms or cuts them.""

**Military implications**

The loss of the internet cables and the connectivity they provide has huge military implications, [as Russia has shown](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/09/technology/ukraine-internet-russia-censorship.html ) by targeting internet infrastructure in its assault on Ukraine.

Joseph Hwang, an affiliate faculty member at George Mason University, told VOA Mandarin that fixing the cables severed last month would take time and money.

""Due to limited international funding, emergency repairs are expected to arrive on April 20 at the earliest,"" he said. He estimated repairs would cost between $329,500 and $659,000 in U.S. dollars.

He suggested that Taiwan, U.S. and Asian allies should strengthen undersea infrastructure by investing in cable armor, deeper burial and decoy cables, and consider establishing legal frameworks that clearly explain the consequences of accidental or intentional underwater cable destruction.

In an article in [The Hill](https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/3896916-china-has-three-roads-to-taiwan-the-us-must-block-them-all/), Dan Blumenthal and Frederick W. Kagan, scholars at the American Enterprise Institute, said that if China invades Taiwan, ""China can cut off lines of communication and interdict military and civilian supplies by air and sea, then Taiwan eventually would have to capitulate.""

James Holmes, the J.C. Wylie chair of maritime strategy at the U.S. Naval War College, told VOA Mandarin it's unsurprising that China would dive underwater to bring pressure on Taiwan and isolate the island from the world. He said the best pushback against such tactics is deterrence.

""China's and Russia's undersea connections to the outside world are as vulnerable as anyone else's, and Beijing and Moscow must know it,"" he said. ""So, we may be looking at another form of conventional, mutual assured destruction as gray-zone competition dives underwater.""

Gray-zone actions are those waged by one government to gain advantage over another in a way that does not provoke a conventional military response, according to a [Center for Strategic and International Studies report](https://www.csis.org/analysis/competing-gray-zone-countering-competition-space-between-war-and-peace).

**US actions**

In at least six private undersea cable deals over the past four years, the U.S. government has either intervened to keep HMN Tech, a subsidiary of the sanctioned Chinese firm Huawei, out of the undersea cable business in the Asia-Pacific region or it has forced the rerouting or abandonment of cables that would have directly linked U.S. and Chinese territories, according to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/us-china-tech-cables/).

As of early 2023, there were more than 550 active and planned submarine cables worldwide, according to TeleGeography, a telecommunications market research and consulting firm in Washington, which figures there are nearly 1.4 million kilometers of submarine cables in service globally.

Undersea cables carry over 99.4% of intercontinental internet traffic, Jayne Miller, spokesperson for TeleGeography, told VOA Mandarin via email. ""Even with lots of satellite constellation launches, the capacity of a single submarine cable dwarfs that of many satellites combined,"" she said.

""Cables can carry far more data at far less cost than satellites,"" according to the TeleGeography website. U.S. government figures ""indicate that satellites account for just 0.37% of all U.S. international capacity.""

The cables are laid between locations that need to communicate. A [map](https://www.submarinecablemap.com) of the world's undersea cables shows almost two dozen cables connecting North America with Asia and fewer than 20 connecting Europe and North America. There are fewer than five cables connecting Africa and South America, and no cable connecting Australia and South America.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, including specific incidents where cables have been cut, such as the recent cuts between Taiwan and the Matsu Islands.

Third time that the AAG has ruptured this year, following breaks in January and May.

Vietnam’s millions of internet users and millions of football fans are not a happy lot this weekend.

They have just heard that service on the Asia America Gateway (AAG) cable has been disrupted, which means sluggish access to international websites, at a time the football World Cup, the most followed sporting event in the world, is underway in Russia.

A local internet service provider said unstable power supply could be the cause, and no repair schedule has been announced, a _Vietnam News Agency_ report said.

The disruption will affect all service providers in Vietnam, it added.

This is the third time the AAG has ruptured this year, following two instances in January and May.

Connected in November 2009, the $560-million AAG cable handles more than 60 percent of the country’s international internet traffic. The system runs more than 20,000 kilometers (12,420 miles), connecting Southeast Asia and the U.S., passing through Brunei, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Since its debut, the cable has encountered a ""very high"" risk of rupture and been under frequent repair, affecting all service providers in Vietnam.

The cable suffered technical errors at least five times in 2017.

Vietnam currently has six submarine cable systems, as well as a 120 gigabit channel that runs overland through China. With a download speed of 5.46 megabytes per second, Vietnam's internet speed was ranked 74th out of 189 countries and territories in a global survey of broadband speeds compiled by Cable.co.uk, a U.K. broadband, TV, phone and mobile provider, last August.

Vietnam's average broadband speed is 10 times lower than its Southeast Asian neighbor Singapore, according to the survey. However, the country still managed to trump six other countries in the region.

Geopolitical tensions are brewing globally over the cutting of subsea cables — critical infrastructure powering cross-border internet connectivity — in the Baltic Sea.

The severing of the cables prompted warnings of “sabotage” and potential “hybrid” warfare targeting key infrastructure in the West amid further escalations in the ongoing war in Ukraine.

Last week, two undersea cables were severed in the Baltic Sea, raising suspicions that subsea communication systems may be the latest target of sabotage against the West, as it clashes with Russia over the country’s invasion of Ukraine.

One of the cables disrupted was C-Lion1, which links Finland and Germany and is owned by Cinia, a Finnish state-controlled IT firm. Spanning nearly 1,200 kilometers (730 miles), it is the only direct connection of its kind between Finland and Central Europe.

The other cable damaged was one connecting Lithuania and Sweden, BCS East West Interlink. Arelion, the company which owns it, told CNBC data traffic that would have gone through it has been rerouted to alternatives.

Arelion cannot yet comment on how the cable was damaged, he said, adding that the incident is being investigated by Swedish police.

Repairing subsea cables isn’t easy, according to Andy Champagne, senior vice president and chief technology officer of Akamai Labs. “While we’re linked together with a complex physical web of fiber optic cables over land, the topology becomes more challenging once we plunge into the oceans,” he told CNBC. “It’s really complex to install subsea cables. And, when there is an issue with a subsea cable, repairing it is a non-trivial job.”

Subsea cables are massive fiber-optic cables laid on the seabed, which carry data like webpages, email, and video calls between continents. They are the backbone of the global internet, delivering 99% of the world’s intercontinental data traffic.

An investigation is under way, with authorities looking to determine the perpetrator. The attack has so far not been attributed to a single entity or country. On Thursday, Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” that the country is “in close contact with China.”

Germany, without naming a specific potential suspect, said it believes the cable cut was an act of “sabotage” and possible “hybrid” warfare. In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of Finland and Germany said the incident “immediately raises suspicions of intentional damage,” adding that a “thorough investigation” is being carried out.","The article discusses the severing of undersea cables in the Baltic Sea, detailing specific incidents, potential sabotage, and geopolitical implications.

**Published Date:** 01/30/2023  

Four out of five undersea cables connecting Vietnam to the world are broken in one way or another, causing internet speeds across the country to slow to a snail’s pace.

A local internet service provider reported Monday that the Intra Asia (IA) cable has been encountering problems since last Saturday. There was a breakage at a cable section located about 130 km from a shoreline station in Singapore, causing a total loss of international data from Vietnam to Singapore through the IA cable.

The latest breakage means that only one undersea cable connecting Vietnam globally, the SMW3, remains fully functional.

Vietnam is currently connected with seven undersea cables: SMW3, AAG, IA, APG, AAE-1, SJC2 and ADC. Besides the recent breakage of the IA, problems with the AAE, AAG and APG cables that have been present since 2022 and early 2023 have yet to be fully resolved.

The SJC2 and the ADC are yet to be officially operational, while the SMW3 cable is outdated and about to be decommissioned.

The fact that Vietnam currently only has one fully functional undersea cable has caused internet speeds between Vietnam and the rest of the world to slow to a crawl.

Phuong Thanh, from Hanoi’s Cau Giay District, said her internet connection became fickle on Sunday. She noticed because her video streaming service quality dropped to the lowest resolution.

""I was planning to watch the rest of a film to end my _Tet_ holiday, but the images were blurry,"" she said. ""It’s really a pain.""

Thanh Trung, an online business vendor in Ho Chi Minh City, said he also encountered issues with his internet connection when he opened up shop Monday morning.

""I was planning to kick-start the new year with dozens of orders waiting to be processed, but an hour passed and I still couldn’t access the management page. It means orders were delayed and my customers are still waiting,"" he said, adding that his internet speed on his PC had never been so slow.

Trung said that when he switched to a mobile internet connection the situation improved somewhat, although the speed was still considerably slower than before.

A representative of VNPT said the fact that four cables were simultaneously encountering issues would mean that international internet connections across Vietnam would be ""more or less"" affected, especially during rush hours, and for those whose online activities require high internet bandwidths (online gaming, video streaming, etc.).

""This is an unavoidable situation and affects all internet service providers in Vietnam,"" VNPT reported Monday.

Service providers said they were working with units managing the undersea cables to resolve the issues, as well as deploying other measures to optimize data transference.","The article titled 'Internet crawls as four undersea cables need repairs' discusses the issues surrounding undersea cables in detail.

One of Vietnam’s major submarine cable systems vital to its international connectivity has encountered a problem off Da Nang as Internet users are told to brace for sluggish connection in the upcoming days.

The Asia Pacific Gateway (APG) communications cable system suffered an issue at dusk on Sunday.

The problem was detected around 130 kilometers off a landing point in the central city of Da Nang, slowing international connectivity for local users.

"Defending Subsea Cables: Key Challenges","Explores the strategic risks to subsea cables, including increased threats from Russian activity and the implications for global internet connectivity.","https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/the-challenge-of-defending-subsea-cables","","The Maritime Executive",Yes,"Pete Barker","Fort Lauderdale, Florida, United States","1700000","2023-02-06","English","The Maritime Executive","**The Challenge of Defending Subsea Cables**  
Published Mar 20, 2018 9:27 PM by **CIMSEC**  

For centuries, the sea has enabled trade between nations. Shipping continues to underpin international commerce today. But there is another unseen contribution that the oceans make to the current global order. Deep below the waters, travelling at millions of miles per hour, flickers of light relay incredible quantities of information across the world, powering the exchange of data that forms the internet. From urgent stock market transactions to endless videos of cats, undersea cables support many aspects of twenty first century life that we take for granted.  

Strategists have neglected submarine cables. Whilst topics such as piracy and cyber attacks on ports frequently arise in discussions on maritime threats, cables have not always been as prominent.  

There are signs that this is changing. A recent report for the Policy Exchange by Rishi Sunak, a member of the UK Parliament, gained significant media coverage. It was not ignored by senior military figures. A few weeks later, the United Kingdom Chief of Defence Staff, Air Chief Marshall Sir Stuart Peach, gave a speech to RUSI, where he said, “there is a new risk to our way of life that is the vulnerability of the cables that crisscross the seabed.”  

In late 2017, NATO Submarine Commander Rear Admiral Lennon (USN) revealed that “we are now seeing Russian underwater activity in the vicinity of undersea cables that I don’t believe we have ever seen. Russia is clearly taking an interest in NATO and NATO nations’ undersea infrastructure.”  

**Understanding Submarine Cables**  

Vast technical expertise is not necessary to understand why submarine cables are so important. The internet is, at its most basic level, a transfer of information. With the advent of cloud computing, the simple act of storing a file means that data travels from a user on one continent to a server halfway around the world.  

Submarine cables are mainly private assets. Although expensive (an intercontinental cable is cited as costing between $100 million to $500 million), they are significantly cheaper than the satellite alternatives.  

**Attacks on Submarine Cables**  

These cables are vulnerable to deliberate attack in many ways. The most basic method of attack is simply to break the cable. Their construction means that this task presents little difficulty either mechanically or through the use of small explosive charges.  

Cables can also be attacked in non-physical ways. Although shrouded in classification, intelligence analysts have openly stated in national newspapers that the U.S. submarine USS Jimmy Carter may have the capability to “tap” undersea cables and obtain the data being transferred without breaching the cable.  

**Legal Protections**  

Legally, the status of undersea cables have little protection, particularly when they are outside the jurisdiction of any state and lie on the seabed of the high seas.  

**Strategies for the Undersea Cable Problem**  

Clearly, a protection strategy for undersea cables cannot depend solely on military action. It is impossible to protect the entire cable network given its global expanse.  

The geographic area requiring protection is vast, and the resources to do so are limited.

The problem on the APG cable system has negatively impacted international connection in the Southeast Asian country, a representative of a local Internet service provider (ISP) stated.

Domestic ISPs have redirected all connections through the APG system to other cables in order to minimize the connection disruption.

According to the Vietnam Internet Association, international connection in Vietnam relies on multiple submarine cable systems, namely the APG, AAG, SMW3, Intra-Asia (IA), and Asia-Africa-Europe 1 (AAE-1).

The APG, which runs about 10,400 kilometers underwater across the Pacific Ocean, connects Vietnam with mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Singapore.

The cable system was launched in 2016 with a traffic capacity of 54.8 terabits per second – the largest of any other cables in Asia – and had been expected to provide more stable connection for Vietnamese Internet users.

Many popular Vietnamese ISPs such as VNPT, Viettel, FPT Telecom, and CMC Telecom are using this cable system for their services.

The reason behind the problem has yet to be identified, while repair plans will be announced in the upcoming days.

The **[AAG cable system](https://tuoitrenews.vn/news/society/20200519/internet-speed-in-vietnam-stutters-as-submarine-cable-breaks-down-again/54654.html)** previously broke down for the second time this year on May 14, causing Internet speed in the country to be latent.

Repairs to this cable system are expected to be finished on June 2.

The AAG is a 20,000-kilometer submarine communications cable system connecting Southeast Asia with the U.S. mainland across the Pacific Ocean via Guam and Hawaii.

It was put into operation in November 2009.

Three such incidents impacted users on the African continent in 2020 alone. Each year more than a hundred cable breaks are recorded across the world causing disruptions to communications and connectivity.

A recent study conducted by Professor Peter J. Talling and a team from the Departments of Earth Sciences and Geography, from the University of Durham in the UK, co-led by Angola Cables and supported by industry members including, the Vodafone Group, British Telecom, NERC Environmental and others, has delivered important findings presenting valuable insights for the routing and protection of future subsea cables.

In January 2020, the South Atlantic 3/West Africa (SAT-3/Wasc) cable, linking Africa to Portugal and Spain was hit by a breakdown in Gabon, whilst the West Africa Cable System (Wacs) that connects South Africa to the United Kingdom saw an outage off the coast of the DRC Congo.

In March, the WACS cable experienced a further break affecting international bandwidth. Whilst many ISPs suffered extended outage periods, most of the major mobile operators were able to mitigate the impact on internet traffic due to their redundancy measures and were in a position to redirect data traffic to other subsea cable networks. Large telcos and mobile operators often employ a divergent strategy to ensure they have alternative routings in place should one of their data carrying cables be affected.

**Threats to subsea cables**

It is estimated that around 1.2 million kilometres of subsea cable carrying power and transmitting data currently transverse continents and geographies across the world. Most of these cables are either buried in the seabed or rest on the ocean floor.

Nearly 75% of the damage caused to these cables are the result of being snagged or damaged by the anchors of ships. Deep see cable faults in water depths of more than 1,000 metres below the sea level, are almost always caused by natural events such as current abrasion, underwater landslides and underwater seismic activity. Often the problem with deep water faults is that they are not as easy to detect and can impact multiple cables – making recovery and repair efforts both lengthy and costly to cable operators.

The cable fault on the SAT-3 was likely caused by an exceptionally large and powerful submarine mud slide that originated at the mouth of the Congo River, just 10 days after the Congo River recorded its largest flood since the 1960s. Sand and mud from the river flood was presumably remobilised, triggering the submarine mud slide that flowed through the offshore Congo Canyon. The canyon is one of the largest underwater canyons on earth, cutting across the continental shelf of West Africa for 85 kilometres until it reaches the shelf edge, then continues down the slope and ends 280 kilometres from its origin. At its deepest point, the V-shaped canyon walls are 1100 meters in height.

These powerful mud slides that damage seabed cables are notoriously difficult to measure in action and are thus poorly understood. The international study undertaken involved the placement of a series of sensors along the canyon, and these sensors that recorded unique information on this type of mud slide. According to observations by Professor Talling and the team, “the data that we recovered from the seabed sensor and mooring data sets within the Congo Canyon have revealed that the undersea mudslide is possibly the longest recorded sediment flow yet measured in action on our planet.”

The evidence gathered provided valuable scientific insights into how major flows are triggered; the frequency, speed and potential impact of mudslides or runout events – the longer the runout the more hazardous these mudslides can be for undersea cables. The other important conclusion was that some cables do not break, but adjacent cables can experience faults by virtue of their location or next to deeply eroded knickpoints.

The January 2020 event caused 9 of the oceanographic moorings to surface. By combining the timings of when moorings reached the sea surface and the cable breaks, Professor Talling and his team were able to calculate the flow speed of the massive undersea avalanche. It has been estimated that following the initial mudslide in the canyon, the moving sediment increased in speed from 5 m/s in Angolan waters in the upper canyon, to reach 8 m/s in the deep ocean, at water depths of 4-5 km – running out some 1,200 km from the river mouth.

“Depending on the proximity of cable repair vessels, outages can often take a number of weeks to repair resulting in costly losses to economies impacted by such breaks,” notes Talling, “Gathering evidence and the recorded data in studies such as these are critical to understanding the nature of such subterranean events, and how the subsea cable industry can better provide more durable solutions in keeping the cables – and the world connected.”

Four separate underwater data cables have been damaged in the Red Sea, impacting global internet connectivity. The cuts have impacted four telecommunications companies and forced about 25% of internet traffic in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East to be rerouted.

Warnings have circulated in recent weeks that Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels could target subsea cables. The Houthis, who have been attacking commercial vessels in the Red Sea in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, have recently renewed promises to target U.S. and U.K. military ships. The militant group has denied any involvement in cutting the cables.

### SIGNALS

**Semafor Signals:** Global insights on today's biggest stories.

### It would take coordinated effort to bring a nation off-grid

Underwater internet cables in the Red Sea carry nearly all of the data and financial communications between Europe and Asia. Targeting the cables therefore disrupts critical infrastructure — and the Houthis posted veiled threats on Telegram as early as December that they may disrupt fiber optic cables that run across the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. While the cuts have disrupted internet connections, they are also resilient, one expert told the outlet: “It would be extremely difficult to completely disconnect a well-connected country. It would require a very sophisticated and coordinated attack to take them out all at the same time.”

### Replacing cut lines is expensive and dangerous

Costs to insure cable ships have skyrocketed in recent weeks, with some insurers charging as much as $150,000 per day. It is also a dangerous task for the slow-moving ships that lay the cables across the seabed as they come under increasing threat of attacks from the Houthis. Since the region is currently contested, shipping companies have sought relationships with regulators on both sides of Yemen’s civil war to avoid antagonizing either party. The cables are at risk even without the threat of direct attacks: Anchors from ships and fishing can damage the lines, and about 150 service issues are recorded each year from accidental causes.","The article titled 'Severed Red Sea data cables disrupt global internet connections' discusses the damage to four underwater data cables in the Red Sea, which has significantly impacted global internet connectivity.

Others living on Matsu, one of Taiwan’s outlying islands closer to neighboring China, had to struggle with paying electricity bills, making a doctor’s appointment or receiving a package.

For connecting to the outside world, Matsu’s 14,000 residents rely on two submarine internet cables leading to Taiwan’s main island. The National Communications Commission, citing the island’s telecom service, blamed two Chinese ships for cutting the cables. It said a Chinese fishing vessel is suspected of severing the first cable some 50 kilometers (31 miles) out at sea. Six days later, on Feb. 8, a Chinese cargo ship cut the second, NCC said.

Taiwan’s government stopped short of calling it a deliberate act on the part of Beijing, and there was no direct evidence to show the Chinese ships were responsible.

The islanders in the meantime were forced to hook up to a limited internet via microwave radio transmission, a more mature technology, as backup. It means one could wait hours to send a text. Calls would drop, and videos were unwatchable.

“A lot of tourists would cancel their booking because there’s no internet. Nowadays, the internet plays a very large role in people’s lives,” said Chen, who lives in Beigan, one of Matsu’s main residential islands.

Apart from disrupting lives, the loss of the internet cables, seemingly innocuous, has huge implications for national security.

As the full-scale invasion of Ukraine has shown, Russia has made taking out internet infrastructure one of the key parts of its strategy. Some experts suspect China may have cut the cables deliberately as part of its harassment of the self-ruled island it considers part of its territory, to be reunited by force if necessary.

China regularly sends warplanes and navy ships toward Taiwan as part of tactics to intimidate the island’s democratic government. Concerns about China’s invasion, and Taiwan’s preparedness to withstand it, have increased since the war in Ukraine.

The cables had been cut a total of 27 times in the past five years, but it was unclear which country the vessels hailed from, based on data from Chunghwa Telecom.

Taiwan’s coast guard gave chase to the fishing vessel that cut the first cable on Feb. 2, but it went back to Chinese waters, according to an official who was briefed on the incident and was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Authorities found two Chinese ships in the area where the cables were cut, based on automated identification system data, similar to GPS, which shows a vessel’s location.

“We can’t rule out that China destroyed these on purpose,” said Su Tzu-yun, a defense expert at the government think tank, Institute for National Defense and Security Research, citing a research that only China and Russia had the technical capabilities to do this. “Taiwan needs to invest more resources in repairing and protecting the cables.”

Internet cables, which can be anywhere between 20 millimeters to 30 millimeters (0.79 inches to 1.18 inches) wide, are encased in steel armor in shallow waters where they’re more likely to run into ships. Despite the protection, cables can get cut quite easily by ships and their anchors, or fishing boats using steel nets.

Even so, “this level of breakage is highly unusual for a cable, even in the shallow waters of the Taiwan Strait,” said Geoff Huston, chief scientist at Asia Pacific Network Information Centre, a non-profit that manages and distributes Internet resources like IP addresses for the region.

Without a stable internet, coffee shop owner Chiu Sih-chi said seeing the doctor for his toddler son’s cold became a hassle because first they had to visit the hospital to just get an appointment.

A breakfast shop owner said she lost thousands of dollars in the past few weeks because she usually takes online orders. Customers would come to her stall expecting the food to be ready when she hadn’t even seen their messages.

Faced with unusual difficulties, Matsu residents came up with all sorts of ways to organize their lives.

One couple planned to deal with the coming peak season by having one person stay in Taiwan to access their reservation system and passing the information on to the other via text messages. Wife Lin Hsian-wen extended her vacation in Taiwan during the off-season when she heard the internet back home wasn’t working and is returning to Matsu later in the week.

Some enterprising residents went across to the other shore to buy SIM cards from Chinese telecoms, though those only work well in the spots closer to the Chinese coast, which is only 10 kilometers (6.21 miles) away at its closest point.

Others, like the bed and breakfast owner Tsao Li-yu, would go to Chunghwa Telecom’s office to use a Wi-Fi hot spot the company had set up for locals to use in the meantime.

“I was going to work at (Chunghwa Telecom),” Tsao joked.

Chunghwa had set up microwave transmission as backup for the residents. Broadcast from Yangmingshan, a mountain just outside of Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, the relay beams the signals some 200 kilometers (124 miles) across to Matsu. Since Sunday, speeds were noticeably faster, residents said.

Wang Chung Ming, the head of Lienchiang County, as the Matsu islands are officially called, said he and the legislator from Matsu went to Taipei shortly after the internet broke down to ask for help, and was told they would get priority in any future internet backup plans.

Taiwan’s Ministry of Digital Affairs publicly asked for bids from low-Earth orbit satellite operators to provide the internet in a backup plan, after seeing Russia’s cyberattacks in the invasion of Ukraine, the head of the ministry, Audrey Tang, told The Washington Post last fall. The ministry said the project does not fall under the law that requires providers to be at least 51% owned by a domestic shareholder.

A spokesperson for the Digital Ministry directed questions about the progress of backup plans to the National Communications Commission. NCC said it will install a surveillance system for the undersea cables, while relying on microwave transmission as a backup option.

Many Pacific island nations, before they started using internet cables, depended on satellites — and some still do — as backup, said Jonathan Brewer, a telecommunications consultant from New Zealand who works across Asia and the Pacific.

There’s also the question of cost. Repairing the cables is expensive, with an early estimate of $30 million New Taiwan Dollars ($1 million) for the work of the ships alone.

“The Chinese boats that damaged the cables should be held accountable and pay compensation for the highly expensive repairs,” said Wen Lii, the head of the Matsu chapter of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.

Wang, the head of Lienchiang County, said he had mentioned the cables on a recent visit to China, where he had met an executive from China Mobile. They offered to send technicians to help. But compensation, he said, will require providing hard proof on who did it.

China’s Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a faxed request for comment.

For now, the only thing residents can do is wait. The earliest cable-laying ships can come is April 20, because there are a limited number of vessels that can do the job.

A month without functional internet has its upsides too. Chen Yu-lin, the bed and breakfast owner, has felt more at peace.

It was hard in the first week, but Chen quickly got used to it. “From a life perspective, I think it’s much more comfortable because you get fewer calls,” he said, adding he was spending more time with his son, who usually is playing games online.

At a web cafe where off-duty soldiers were playing offline games, the effect was the same.

“Our relationships have become a bit closer,” said one soldier who only gave his first name, Samuel. “Because normally when there’s internet, everyone keeps to themselves, and now we’re more connected.","The article discusses the cutting of undersea internet cables that connect the Matsu islands to Taiwan.

Firms across the Middle East, India and Bangladesh are experiencing disruption after undersea broadband cables were damaged between Egypt and Italy.

India is home to an $11bn (£5.5bn) outsourcing industry, but UK firms say they have so far seen little impact.

The disruption looks set to continue, with repairs to take another week, and after another broadband cable was cut between the UAE and Oman.

British Telecom said it was able to quickly re-route its data.

The company said it has network monitoring centres around the globe which quickly alerted it to the problems.

""All in all we didn't have a major impact,"" Sridhar Sriramaneni, vice president of support services at Knoah Solutions, told the BBC. His firm has clients in the UK.

""We had a minor impact for 30 minutes to an hour. We've experienced slowness.""

India's banks and stock exchange also experienced problems on Thursday. Up to 60% of India's 50 million internet users, both individuals and companies, were affected.

India's IT industry employs 700,000, who work for companies that provide a range of services - from answering customer queries to analysing equity markets - to global clients.

Most of the big outsourcing firms have back-up plans in place that allow them to quickly restore services. But they could still experience some small problems says Eric Schoonover, director of research at TeleGeography.

""The emergency routes they are using are not as reliable,"" he said. ""The phone quality could be lower and there could be a slight delay.""

For smaller firms that don't have contingency plans the patchy internet access has proved to be a big headache.

""We have a lot of offices connected by the net so because the internet is down means we are cut off from the head office,"" said Vikas Jain, assistant vice president at AEZ Group, a real estate developer. ""We are facing a lot of problems.""

In December 2006, seven of the eight cables connected to Taiwan were damaged by an earthquake, disrupting communications in much of Asia. These cables took several months to fully repair.

A repair ship is expected to arrive on Tuesday to the site of the severed cables off the northern coast of Egypt to begin work on the damage. The cable should be repaired within a week of the ship's arrival, Flag Telecom said.

Another repair ship has been notified of the damage near Dubai, on the cable between UAE and Oman. The cause of the damage has not been officially confirmed but is thought to be related to a tanker dragging its anchor along the sea bed.

Egypt's Minister of Communications and Information Technology said that the internet service would be up and running there at about 80% of its usual capacity within 48 hours. He'd earlier said that this level would be restored by late on Friday.","The article titled ""Disruption after web cables cut"" directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables.

Hong Kong-based HGC Global Communications said it had taken measures to reroute traffic after four of the 15 cables were recently severed.

The cause is not yet clear.

The US official said it was trying to find out whether the cables were cut deliberately or snagged by an anchor.

Last month, Yemen's internationally-recognised government warned that the Iran-backed Houthi movement might sabotage the undersea cables in addition to attacking ships in the sea.

The Houthis - who control much of western Yemen's Red Sea coast - denied last week that they had targeted cables and blamed US and British military strikes for any damage to them.

US and British forces have targeted Houthi weapons and infrastructure in response to the drone and missile attacks on merchant vessels passing through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

The Houthis say their attacks are a show of support for the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

An estimated 25% of traffic was affected, it added, noting that some 80% of the west-bound traffic from Asia passed through the cables.

HGC said it had taken measures to mitigate any disruptions for its clients by rerouting data to Europe through cables in mainland China and under the Pacific Ocean to the US, as well as using the remaining cables in the Red Sea.

A Pentagon official confirmed to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that undersea telecommunications cables in the Red Sea had been cut.

The official said the US was still trying to determine whether they were deliberately severed or snagged by a ship's anchor.

Last week, Israeli business website Globes reported that the same four cables running between the Saudi city of Jeddah and Djibouti had been damaged and pointed the blame at the Houthis, without providing any evidence. Sky News Arabia, which is based in the United Arab Emirates, cited unnamed sources as accusing the Houthis of ""blowing up"" the cables"".

The Houthis' telecommunications ministry denied those reports.

The ministry said it wanted to reaffirm remarks in a recent speech by Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi, who said the group did not want to put any communications cables at risk.

The decision to ""prevent the passage of Israeli ships"" through the Red Sea did ""not apply to ships belonging to international companies licensed to carry out marine work on cables in Yemeni waters"", it added.

Meanwhile, the US military's Central Command said the Houthis had fired two anti-ship ballistic missiles at a Liberian-flagged, Swiss-owned container ship, MSC Sky II, in the Gulf of Aden. One of the missiles hit the vessel, causing damage but no injuries, it added.

Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea claimed that the ship was Israeli and that it would ""continue to prevent Israeli navigation or those heading to the ports of occupied Palestine"".","The article titled ""Crucial Red Sea data cables cut, telecoms firm says"" provides detailed information about the severing of several undersea communications cables in the Red Sea, which has affected 25% of data traffic between Asia and Europe.
