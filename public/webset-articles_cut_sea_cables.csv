Two cuts occurred in the morning of January 16 on the undersea fiber optic cables West African Communication System (WACS), connecting 14 West African countries, and South Africa Transit 3 (SAT3), which connects 12 countries in the region. These interruptions have disrupted or degraded internet traffic in 10 countries on the continent. The reason for these breaks, which occurred 300 kilometers off the coast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), is still unknown.

This information was confirmed by Jean-Luc Vuillemin, director of international networks and services at Orange, who was contacted by Jeune Afrique.

Orange Marine, a branch specialized in the installation and maintenance of undersea cables, is responsible for the repairs. ""It will take us about six days to get there and about the same time to repair everything,"" says Jean-Luc Vuillemin, referring to the ""Léon Thévenin,"" the cable ship assigned to the operation, which is traveling from Cape Town, South Africa.

**MTN, the Main Operator Affected**

Meanwhile, the NGO Netblocks, which monitors the state of internet connectivity worldwide, indicates that Angola, Botswana, Gabon, Gambia, Mali, Mauritania, Namibia, Niger, Zambia, and Zimbabwe have been more or less severely affected by the outage.

In Congo-Brazzaville, Nigeria, Ghana, and Ivory Coast, MTN, which owns 11% of the WACS, confirmed it is facing connectivity issues due to the WACS cut.

The DRC, dependent on WACS and ACE, which connect its seven million internet users to the global network, is among the countries that have suffered the most from this unfortunate episode. Traffic gradually resumed by the end of the day Thursday, following connection work on the Angolan section of WACS.

Although Cameroon’s network is theoretically more resilient due to the presence of the SAT3 cable, it is also among the victims. According to Netblocks, the outage affected 26% of its network capacity at the peak of the crisis.

In Senegal, ""the incident has no impact on Sonatel’s traffic. Senegal is on the northern segment of SAT3 (between Ghana and Portugal), and there will be no slowdown thanks to these significant investments in undersea cables,"" assures Abdoul Ly, director general of the regulatory authority for telecommunications and posts.

Due to undersea fibre cable breaks off the west coast of Africa, international traffic to and from the country has slowed to a crawl.

The breaks have also made accessing services located beyond South African borders a nightmare, and one of the services affected is Twitter.

We’ve tried a number of different methods to connect to the social network, including logging in to Tweetdeck, pinging Twitter via Windows’ command line tool, and using different mobile networks and connection types. All methods have failed.

The Meme staff also tried using Opera’s browser VPN and TunnelBear for Android, with the idea that perhaps connecting to Twitter through a different server located in India or Singapore would work, but nope. Nothing.

Interestingly, we’re still receiving notifications from Twitter via the Android app, but once tapped the app refuses to load any additional content.

On Friday ISP WebAfrica noted that website loading times would be longer and packet drops would be more pronounced, and this is what we’re now seeing with Twitter.

According to DownDetector, users across South Africa are affected.

The outage aggregator is also noting issues accessing other services from South Africa, especially international gaming servers. These include Call of Duty, Apex Legends, and Rainbow Six Siege.

Byron Clatterbuck, CEO of Seacom.  
  
The breaking of the West Africa Cable System (WACS) submarine cable has resulted in the Seacom cable system carrying a large amount of South Africa’s international Internet traffic.  
This as a vessel is currently on its way to fix the WACS cable, which broke over the weekend, with full restoration expected by 4 April.  
The breaking of the cable has resulted in South Africans experiencing slow Internet speeds.  
Clatterbuck says although not a direct consortium investor, Seacom is one of the largest users of the WACS cable system between SA and Europe.  
He points out Seacom uses the WACS cable system predominantly as a “protected” path for Seacom’s main data superhighway on Africa’s east coast – the Seacom cable system.  
“At a fundamental level, it means that if there is an outage on the Seacom cable system, then our customers’ Internet traffic is routed on the WACS cable system, and if there is an outage on the WACS cable system, as there is at the moment, then Internet traffic gets routed on the Seacom cable system,” says Clatterbuck.  
  
**Meshed network**  
Privately-operated Seacom launched Africa’s first broadband submarine cable system along the continent’s eastern and southern coasts in 2009.  
“To achieve this, we operate our network on a ‘meshed’ basis, meaning over multiple linear routes that are diverse from each other as best we can and, therefore, do not rely fully on any one cable path. The WACS cable system forms a core part of our meshed Internet service platform that ensures we offer an ‘always on’ and high-quality Internet experience to our customers.”  
According to Clatterbuck, the WACS cable break is affecting Seacom in two ways. “It means customers who have purchased WACS capacity from Seacom to form part of their own network backbone are now ‘hard down’ on this route, and they must be using or looking to use other routes to transmit their data traffic.  
“More importantly, it means that for Seacom’s Internet/managed services platform, we are now relying predominantly on the Seacom cable system to carry a large amount of South Africa’s international Internet traffic.”  
He adds the SAT-3 cable is also in the Seacom network backbone, but unfortunately the SAT-3 cable system is currently undergoing repairs and is not operational.  
Nonetheless, Telkom confirmed to ITWeb this morning that SAT-3 was successfully restored last night and 140GB international traffic is now available, thereby alleviating congestion.  
“Being overly reliant on any single cable system is always a risk. However, as Seacom owns and operates the Seacom cable system itself, we are, therefore, more directly involved in its routing, repair and maintenance, giving us greater flexibility in dealing with potential outages or issues on the Seacom cable system,” Clatterbuck says.  
He adds that all Internet customers of Seacom are mitigated from the impact of the WACS outage, by being routed over the Seacom cable system as well.  
Most Seacom Internet customers will not have noticed the WACS outage, as they are routed over the Seacom cable system, he notes.  
  
**Re-routing traffic**  
However, he says, some customers may notice longer latency as their traffic is now being routed across South Africa first (from Cape Town, for example) and then up the east coast of Africa on the Seacom cable system.  
“Furthermore, it has always been Seacom’s position to help the industry and our partners mitigate network impacts when there are cable breaks or outages on other systems. We offer as much restoration capacity as we can (temporary alternative path) to any ISP or network service provider that needs it, and we always take a position to price this fairly and on a short-term basis.  
Clatterbuck points out the WACs cable system is very important to South Africa, as it is one of three key high-speed (multi-terabit) cables connecting SA.  
“Yes, there are only three! Seacom was the first to go live in 2009, followed by EASSy in 2010, and then WACS in 2012. So having only three international multi-terabit cable systems connecting all users in South Africa means it is never a good thing when one of them is down, as that pushes all the traffic to the other two. WACS is a critically important link for South Africa, particularly for customers in the Western Cape, but also as a key protection path for all South African customers in the event of any subsea cable outages on Africa’s east coast.”  
He also explains that many ISPs in SA are heavily reliant on the WACS cable system, as the system is a low-cost high-speed system that connects Africa to Europe on a low-latency routing.  
“If an ISP was using WACS for more than half their traffic routing, however, then their customers are likely facing congestion and poor Internet quality. We have seen reports that some of Africa’s biggest consumer ISPs are now using Seacom’s service to provide restoration and improved quality during this WACS outage.  
“It is particularly critical for customers at home to have a reliable Internet service during this period of national disaster in South Africa due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and Seacom hopes all international cable systems remain stable going forward,” Clatterbuck concludes.","The article titled ""Seacom carries extra traffic as WACS outage continues"" discusses the breaking of the West Africa Cable System (WACS) submarine cable and its significant implications for internet connectivity in South Africa.

A cut-off low over the city this weekend, that resulted in heavy rain and gale force wind gusts in some parts, has forced a repair ship to remain docked in Cape Town’s harbour, according to the South African National Research and Education Network (TENET).

There are no new updates to the WACS break subsequent to below. The cable vessel hinted to attend still remains in Cape Town. For the reported WACS London side issues, the update still remains that this will be attended to at the end Jan/start Feb.

The ship was to assess a break in two cables connecting the UK and Europe to South Africa, namely the WACS and SAT3, which were discovered on Thursday.

Both cables land north of Cape Town but two breaks have been located off the coast of Gabon. A third break was later found off the coast of the UK.

South African ISP Afrihost detailed the current repair efforts in a verbose Status Page update on Sunday afternoon.

“Our upstream providers report that adverse weather in the Western Cape has delayed the departure of the ship to effect repairs to international undersea cables. We currently do not have an ETR for final repairs to be completed,” it wrote.

Both primary and secondary cables failed within a day of each other. We are using an alternate route which does not have sufficient capacity to accommodate all traffic rerouted to it. Our network team are working to provide the best experience possible.

It explained that some services, like international gaming servers and Twitter — which was down across South Africa for most of the weekend — have been “optimised for best performance” as the ISP rerouted traffic via alternative cables.

TENET added that the alternative route is provided by the SEACOM and EASSy cables, which land on South Africa’s eastern coastline, but this will affect load times for those on the western areas of the country.

The alternative routes however do not have sufficient capacity to meet demand, Afrihost added, so it’s likely that South Africans will still experience slow internet access for quite some time. There’s also no estimated time of repair, while it’s not clear when the ship will be dispatched.

Two key undersea cables that connect South Africa to the global internet have both been hit by separate failures. The South Atlantic 3/West Africa (SAT-3/Wasc) submarine cable and the West Africa Cable System (Wacs) have seen breakdowns near Gabon and Congo, respectively.

This has resulted in very slow speeds for some internet users, including to customers of Openserve, Axxess, and Afrihost.

In a freak occurrence, two key undersea cables that connect South Africa to the global internet have both been hit by separate failures, resulting in very slow internet speeds for some users since Thursday.

The SAT-3/Wasc submarine cable, which links Portugal and Spain to South Africa, has been hit by a breakdown near Libreville, Gabon. Meanwhile, the Wacs, which links South Africa with the United Kingdom, saw an outage off the coast of Congo.

Openserve reported that the simultaneous dual cable break has resulted in customers experiencing reduced speed on international browsing, impacting international voice calling and mobile roaming as well.

Internet service provider Afrihost informed users that connections are being re-routed, but it has no estimate on when normal service would resume.

Openserve has made its resources available to both the Wacs and SAT-3/Wasc undersea cable consortiums to assist where possible. A ship is reportedly being dispatched to deal with both cable breaks over the weekend.

Infrastructure provider Openserve says it had been liaising with the WACS and SAT3/WASC undersea cable consortiums to determine the cause of the loss of service on both submarine cable systems.  
The WACS and SAT3/WASC cable systems are deployed in the Atlantic Ocean and connect SA and many other African countries to Europe.  
The WACS system lands in SA at Yzerfontein, Western Cape, while the SAT3/WASC system enters the country at Melkbosstrand, Western Cape.  
Openserve says the unusual and simultaneous dual cable break resulted in customers that are connected to Openserve’s global capacity clients experiencing reduced speed on international browsing.  
International voice calling and mobile roaming has also been impacted, it notes.  
Through continuous liaison with the technical fault investigation teams of both cable consortiums, Openserve has ascertained that the SAT3/WASC break is in the Libreville, Gabon, vicinity and the WACS break point is in the vicinity of Luanda, Angola.  
“Openserve assures its clients and their respective customers that constant interface with the consortiums and their OEM partners will continue until both cable systems are up and running again. Openserve has made its resources available to both consortiums to assist wherever possible.

Johannesburg, 25 Mar 2013  
Undersea cable company Seacom is working on restoring connectivity to transmission customers across the Mediterranean Sea, apparently after a cable break towards the end of last week off the Egyptian shore.  
The company says it has optimised the IP network to relieve congestion where it can and will update end-users as soon as further information becomes available. It has not provided a timeframe for when the connection will be restored.  
However, according to @MWEBGuy, MWeb's technical Twitter contact, ""Early indications are that it may take up to two weeks to repair the break and restore full capacity."" The cable has been down since Friday.  
Seacom launched the first undersea fibre-optic cable, to connect Southern and Eastern Africa with Europe and Asia, in July 2009. The cable connects SA, Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya and Djibouti with the rest of the world via landing points in France (and onwards to London) and India.  
On Saturday, CEO Mark Simpson sent out a message saying multiple cable systems continue to be affected across Africa, the Middle East and Asia.  
@MWEBGuy says the Internet service provider (ISP) is currently trying to source additional capacity. The social media face of the ISP was responding to queries from subscribers about slow or no Internet service posted on Twitter.  
Internet Solutions has also experienced problems as a result of the outage, with its Twitter account indicating it has rerouted traffic and added bandwidth, but some people may experience latency. It does not give a timeframe for resolution.  
### Work in progress  
Simpson says the exact root cause is not likely to be known until the cable is repaired in the coming week or two, and the damaged section is recovered from the seabed and inspected. ""I know that many of you are keen to know the cause of the outage is a physical cable cut some kilometres north of the coast of Egypt in the Mediterranean Sea.""  
Seacom suspects, based on its experience with sub-sea systems and the nature of the sea area where the cut has occurred, that ""the most likely cause is external aggression to the cable, most probably caused by a larger vessel dragging its anchor across the seabed"".  
This is a common cause of damage to cable systems globally, despite continued efforts to protect the cable with armour, burying, notifications to ships of cable location and exclusion zones, notes Simpson.  
Simpson says the Seacom team remains committed to getting restoration services up. ""However, this process is proving much more complex and taking longer than we were initially told by our suppliers and would have expected.""  
Seacom continues to push for activation as a priority, coordinating across a number of carriers internationally, says Simpson. ""However, as this is not providing solutions in the timeframe we require, we are also actively seeking new restoration solutions. This will continue to take some time and we are not able to provide timeframes as yet on when services will be restored.","The article 'Seacom suffers cable break' provides a thorough discussion about a break in an undersea cable, including direct references to 'undersea cable' and 'cable break.' It details the implications for internet connectivity across various regions and the efforts being made to restore services.

Head of Seacom Business Grant Parker says Cape Town and Durban are prime growth opportunities for the company.  

Following the launch of Seacom Business last year, the undersea cable operator has moved to introduce its high-speed bandwidth solutions for businesses in Durban and Cape Town.  

In 2015, the fibre operator introduced Seacom Business in Gauteng, offering connectivity to corporate clients, either directly or through channel partners.  

Seacom Business will allow customers along the coast to access connectivity and cloud services, it says.  

Business customers in Cape Town and Durban metropolitan areas will be able to buy high-speed bandwidth solutions directly from Seacom Business and through its resellers, according to Seacom.  

""We initially launched in Gauteng, supported by the Johannesburg office, where we have enjoyed great success in the enterprise market to date. Rolling out in Cape Town and Durban - the next largest metros in SA - is a natural next step for us. We have had some success on the coast, but want to turn up the volume a bit with a dedicated team in the regions to service customers' needs,"" says Grant Parker, head of Seacom Business.  

Seacom Business has also placed sales teams in Durban and Cape Town to service demand, and established channel partnerships with ICT resellers, service providers and systems integrators active on the coast.  

""With feet on the ground, we will be able to penetrate the market more rapidly. We'll be able to offer a more personal touch to our clients. The expansion will also enhance our client experience by giving our national clients the ability to connect to all major cities throughout South Africa,"" says Parker.  

He adds: ""Clients in these markets have welcomed the launch of Seacom Business and we are already seeing early adopters embrace our services and products. Cape Town and Durban are primed to be exciting growth opportunities for us. Though we were doing some business in these markets before the launch, we expect a more focused and formal approach to catalyse more growth for us.""  

Since introducing its direct-to-business offerings in Gauteng last year, Seacom Business says it has signed up an average of 60 business customers a month and has appointed more than 65 partners to support its drive into the business market.  

According to Parker, Seacom Business will expand to new territories as and when the opportunities make commercial sense.  

""At this stage, we are not looking to set up offices in any other coastal cities. Our cable lands in Durban at Mtunzini, so the region has always been important to us,"" he concludes.","The article 'Seacom targets coastal companies' discusses Seacom Business's expansion in coastal cities, specifically Cape Town and Durban, and directly mentions 'undersea cable' in relation to their operations.

It highlights how the undersea cable infrastructure is integral to their high-speed bandwidth solutions for businesses in these areas, thus impacting internet connectivity.

The discussion around the importance of having a cable land in Durban further emphasizes the central role of undersea cables in Seacom's strategy.

Therefore, the article is not just mentioning cut sea cables; it treats them as a significant aspect of its business model, fulfilling the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables."

Cable ship Leon Thevenin finally departed Cape Town Harbour last night at about 21:30 and will sail to offshore Angola where the first steps of the physical repair on damaged undersea cables – South Atlantic 3/West Africa Submarine Cable (SAT3/WASC) and the West African Cable System (WACS) – will commence.  
Strong and gale force winds in the City of Cape Town last week and over the weekend delayed the operations of the cable ship.  
In a statement this morning, Openserve says following delays caused by weather conditions last weekend, loading of the vessel with all gear and material required for the undersea cable repairs was completed by 17:40 yesterday.  
The Leon Thevenin then set sail from South African shores with chief of mission Didier Mainguy and 53 other crew members on board. A senior representative from the WACS and SAT3 consortium forms part of the ship’s crew.  
The Leon Thevenin is a French cable-laying vessel named in honour of French engineer Leon Charles Thevenin. It was famously used in conjunction with a robot submarine named Scarab 1 for recovering the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder boxes from Air India Flight 182 that was destroyed in mid-air by a bomb as it was crossing Irish airspace, on 23 June 1985.  
Earlier this week, Openserve said fixing the two submarine cables that snapped simultaneously last week will be a complex task.  
Since then, the Telkom subsidiary has been liaising with the WACS and SAT3/WASC undersea cable consortiums to determine the cause of the loss of service on both submarine cable systems.  
The WACS and SAT3/WASC cable systems are deployed in the Atlantic Ocean and connect SA and many other African countries to Europe.  
The WACS system lands in SA at Yzerfontein, Western Cape, while the SAT3/WASC system enters the country at Melkbosstrand, Western Cape.  
Through continuous liaison with the technical fault investigation teams of both cable consortiums, Openserve has ascertained the SAT3/WASC break is in the Libreville, Gabon, vicinity and the WACS break point is in the vicinity of Luanda, Angola.  
Openserve last week said the unusual and simultaneous dual cable break resulted in customers that are connected to Openserve’s global capacity clients experiencing reduced speed on international browsing. International voice calling and mobile roaming were also impacted, it noted.  
Telkom, through its infrastructure provisioning division Openserve, and many other South African and internationally based licensed operators hold equity in these cables.  
The capacity that wholesale operators hold is sold on to Internet service providers (ISPs) and other industry players that require international connectivity.  
The undersea cable systems are consortium-run and the maintenance and operations sub-committees of these consortiums are responsible for the repairs that are required for restoration of full service.  
In its statement today, Openserve says weather conditions permitting, it is anticipated that the vessel will reach its first repair site on the evening of 28 January.  
The vessel has been dispatched from the Cape Town Harbour, by the Maintenance and Operations Sub-Committees of the SAT3/WASC and WACS consortia due to a simultaneous dual cable break that occurred in the early hours of last Thursday, 16 January.

South Africa’s international connectivity has been fully restored after the fixing of the SAT3/WASC subsea cable that broke last month.

In a statement this morning, Openserve, one of the organisations affected by the cable break, says: “In the early hours of this morning (approximately 01:30) Openserve received confirmation, from aboard cable ship Leon Thevenin, that the portion of the SAT3/WASC repair offshore Congo has now been completed.”

It notes this concludes a long and complex restoration process of an unprecedented simultaneous cable break of two Atlantic Ocean-based submarine cable systems – the South Atlantic 3/West Africa Submarine Cable (SAT3/WASC) and the West African Cable System (WACS).

Openserve has since been liaising with the WACS and SAT3/WASC undersea cable consortia to determine the cause of the loss of service on both submarine cable systems.

The WACS and SAT3/WASC cable systems are deployed in the Atlantic Ocean and connect SA and many other African countries to Europe.

The WACS system lands in SA at Yzerfontein, Western Cape, while the SAT3/WASC system enters the country at Melkbosstrand, Western Cape.

This catastrophe, which caused South African Internet users reduced speed on international browsing and impacted international voice calling and mobile roaming, occurred in the early hours of 16 January.

According to Openserve, South Africans can now breathe a sigh of relief as international connectivity capacity returns to normal.

It notes the maintenance and operations sub-committees of both cable consortia had tasked their respective restoration processes to a single chief of mission on the Leon Thevinin.

The vessel departed Cape Town Harbour on the evening of Wednesday, 22 January, and has since been out on open water effecting the repair processes, at multiple break locations.

The ship will now proceed to its next location, offshore Ghana, to undertake a power-related (shunt fault) repair on the WACS cable, the Telkom subsidiary says.

It notes this fault is not affecting traffic on WACS. “If conditions allow, the entire mission is still set to be completed around 25 February, with the vessel returning to dock in Cape Town.

“In the early stages of the repair mission, Openserve’s global capacity team concluded commercial deals with several parties as a measure to minimise some of the impact on its network, and that of its clients’. As part of its internal close-out procedure the relevant teams in Openserve will, over the next few weeks, analyse the full impact of this unusual dual break on its international connectivity capacity.”

The company says this exercise will be conducted with a view to minimising, and possibly mitigating, the impact on the South African broadband ecosystem should the country find itself dealing with a similar catastrophic event in future.

“Openserve is grateful that the submarine cables have been returned to full capacity. The infrastructure provider thanks its clients for the patience exercised during this time and is most pleased that it could collaborate with industry partners and other cable consortia to minimise the impact as much as it did.","The article discusses the restoration of connectivity after the repair of the SAT3/WASC subsea cable, directly referencing 'subsea cable' and 'submarine cable systems'.

Ethiopia, Sudan and Tanzania are reportedly in the midst of a major internet outage caused by cuts to the FLAG Alcatel-Lucent Optical Network (FALCON) in Yemen.  

According to reports, the cuts happened on January 9, and in a statement by Global Cloud Xchange (GCX) which manages the system, it stated that it had suffered “two major cable cuts off-shore near Port Suez.”  

The cable routes impacted include the Falcon line between Muscat and Suez and the FEA between Mumbai and Suez.  

Initial findings from the company indicate that the cause of the break was “an anchor drag by a large merchant vessel in the immediate area”. GCX has already deployed repair ships and is working to “apply for required permits.”  

The company says that the time of repair will depend on how long it takes to procure the permits.  

In the meantime, GCX says that all layer 1 traffic will remain down, and that it is working on restoring connection through various other means, such as using third part cables where possible.  

The entire Gulf region, along with a number of African countries have been affected by the internet outage, but Yemen has reportedly come off worse for wear with 80% of its internet connections down.  

The area around the Suez Canal and the Red Sea has been described by Doug Madory, Director of Internet Analysis at Oracle Internet Intelligence as ‘very shallow’, making it susceptible to anchor drops and cable cuts like this one.

Sub-Saharan Africa continued to report Internet and data access issues following accidental cuts of the undersea West Africa Cable System (WACS) that runs along the coast – and it looks as if there is no quick fix to a problem that began Thursday.  
The TENET/NREN research-tech group in South Africa said a ship would be sent to the cable break near Congo, with repairs there expected over the weekend. But the cable vessel remained in Cape Town because of winds on Saturday, and then was waiting to load repair equipment late Monday.  
“When the vessel has loaded and departed, the expected duration to location of the break is around six days. Fixing the break will take another week at least,” the group said in an update.  
The 16,000-kilometer system runs from South Africa to the UK, connecting much of western and central Africa to Europe and each other. A second WACS break near the UK likely won’t be fixed until late January, TENET/NREN said, with complete system repairs expected in early February.  
A second cable, the SAT3/WACS, also was damaged and unable to support rerouted traffic, with that break site believed to be near Libreville, the capital of Gabon.  
“Further tests are being conducted by the upstream provider along with the cable consortium,” said Pro2Col Lab, based in South Africa. “There’s still no Estimated Time of Resolution.”  
That’s left dozens of service providers scrambling to respond to complaints with thousands of Africans dealing with absent or slow service. Major outages were reported across all South African providers as well as in Democratic Republic of Congo. The cable system feeds terminals on the west coast that connect to interior locations and their service providers.  
MTN said its service in Ghana and Nigeria was back up late Saturday, but that wasn’t the case everywhere and some customers in those countries continued to complain of slow service. In South Africa, some TENET/NREN partners were rerouted on the eastern SEACOM and EASSy cables.  
The WACS Cable site itself was offline early Sunday, with no additional information on the service.","The article titled 'Ship to fix undersea cable breaks is delayed as African tech users wait' discusses significant incidents regarding the undersea West Africa Cable System (WACS) and the SAT3/WACS cable.

WACS is a submarine communications cable linking SA with the UK along the west coast of Africa that was constructed by Alcatel-Lucent. The cable consists of four fibre pairs and is 14,530 km in length, linking from Yzerfontein in the Western Cape of SA to London in the UK.

In January, WACS also suffered a cable break together with the SAT3/WASC cable, resulting in slow Internet speeds in SA.

Local Internet service providers (ISPs) have already started feeling the impact of the WACS cable break.

In a tweet this morning, ISP Afrohost said: “Two of the undersea cables (WACS and SAT3) have suffered breaks. We’re working together with our suppliers to secure an alternate international path ASAP. We understand that you need your Internet now more than ever. This is our top priority. Thanks for your patience.”

Webafrica says: “We are currently experiencing slow speeds due to WACS undersea cable breaks. We are busy attending to the issue and will keep you updated on our Network Status page.”

Says Telkom: “Good day, please note that due to pre-existing outage on the West Africa Submarine Cable System (WACS), you may experience slow Internet response when browsing international websites. Our team of technicians are investigating this and will provide feedback soon.”

In an update to customers, Vox says: “Major international outage affecting WACS and SAT3 submarine cable systems which deliver traffic from South Africa to international destinations.

In February, cable ship Leon Thevenin was used to fix broken undersea cables.  

A cable vessel is on its way to fix the broken West Africa Cable System (WACS) submarine cable that is causing slow Internet speeds in South Africa.  

This is according to the latest reports from the RENAlerts service by SANReN and TENET. The reports say it is estimated the repair will be completed by 4 April.  

The cable break was first revealed on Saturday by the South African National Research & Education Network (SANReN), a major user of the cable, which detected the break just before midnight.  

The break came at a time when South African Internet service providers (ISPs) are reporting increased network traffic as more people are working and learning from home to curb the spreading of the coronavirus.  

WACS is a submarine communications cable linking South Africa with the UK along the west coast of Africa that was constructed by Alcatel-Lucent.  

The cable consists of four fibre pairs and is 14,530 km in length, linking from Yzerfontein in the Western Cape of South Africa to London in the UK.  

For the latest break, ISPs have started putting in place contingency measures to mitigate the slow speeds.  

Liquid Telecom SA, part of Pan-African telecoms group Liquid Telecom, announced it had mitigated network outages due to the unexpected loss of connectivity following a recent break in the WACS undersea cable.  

Seacom states that while repairs on the WACS undersea cable systems are being planned, many ISPs will need to re-route their traffic via alternative paths.

Undersea broadband cable Eassy, which connects countries along Eastern Africa to high-speed Internet, has been damaged, resulting in minor service disruption.  
The 10,000 km cable, stretching from Sudan to South Africa, experienced a cut between Djibouti and Port Sudan, according to Chris Wood, chief executive of West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC), the largest shareholder in Eassy with a 30% stake.  
He further states that the fault has only resulted in minimal disruption owing to Eassy's collapsed ring protection system that allows for internal re-routing of traffic.  
A WIOCC representative further told ITWeb that the company is currently not in a position to give an exact date for when the repair of the fault is to be completed.  
“The only services affected are those either originating or terminating in Port Sudan, or those using Port Sudan to connect to other systems for transit to Europe.  
“As the vast majority of Eassy's traffic exits through Djibouti, most customers have not felt the impact of the cut to Eassy,” Wood adds.  
Africa's growing number of undersea cables means incidents of service disruptions, especially as a result of ships dropping anchors on cables, are increasing.  
Two years ago, Africa's Seacom undersea cable, which also connects the east coast of Africa, experienced a similar cut that took almost three weeks to repair.  
With more undersea broadband cables connecting Africa having come online, such as the West Africa Cable System, businesses that rely on the networks say they are mitigating service disruption risks by using a number of different cables.  
Graham Beneke, systems engineer at Neology, a wholesale bandwidth provider to ISPs in Africa, says the latest Eassy cut has not really affected his company's operations. “We have capacity on all the other undersea cables as well.  
“By having one cable running up the east coast, and by having one cable running up the west coast, the same ship is unlikely to cause a fault on both cables simultaneously,” he adds.","The article titled ""Eassy cable damaged"" discusses the damage to the Eassy undersea broadband cable, which connects countries along Eastern Africa to high-speed internet.

Fixing the two submarine cables that snapped simultaneously last week will be a complex task. This is according to infrastructure provider Openserve, which has been liaising with the WACS and SAT3/WASC undersea cable consortiums to determine the cause of the loss of service on both submarine cable systems.  

The WACS and SAT3/WASC cable systems are deployed in the Atlantic Ocean and connect South Africa and many other African countries to Europe. The WACS system lands in South Africa at Yzerfontein, Western Cape, while the SAT3/WASC system enters the country at Melkbosstrand, Western Cape.  

Through continuous liaison with the technical fault investigation teams of both cable consortiums, Openserve has ascertained that the SAT3/WASC break is in the Libreville, Gabon vicinity and the WACS break point is in the vicinity of Luanda, Angola.  

Openserve reported that the unusual and simultaneous dual cable break resulted in customers connected to Openserve’s global capacity experiencing reduced speed on international browsing. International voice calling and mobile roaming were also impacted.  

An update from Openserve indicates that the cable vendors appointed by the consortia will likely provide timelines to fully restore the cables only once a cable ship reaches the break location and the repair crew investigates the nature and severity of the breaks.  

A cable ship currently docked at Cape Town harbour is expected to be dispatched for repairs. Openserve noted that even simple repairs at great depths in the ocean can be complex, depending on wind speeds and weather conditions.  

Openserve has capacity on other submarine cables that connect through the Indian Ocean to Asia and Europe, allowing for a slow response rather than a complete loss of connectivity. The company is working to divert traffic to these cables to minimize the impact on clients.  

As a South African network operator, Openserve is dependent on its consortium partners to manage the restoration process efficiently. World Wide Worx MD Arthur Goldstuck mentioned that it could take at least two weeks before repairs are likely to be completed.","The article discusses the dual submarine cable breaks, their implications on internet connectivity, and the efforts to repair them.

Byron Clatterbuck, CEO of Seacom.  
The breaking of the West Africa Cable System (WACS) submarine cable has resulted in the Seacom cable system carrying a large amount of South Africa’s international Internet traffic.  
This as a vessel is currently on its way to fix the WACS cable, which broke over the weekend, with full restoration expected by 4 April.  
The breaking of the cable has resulted in South Africans experiencing slow Internet speeds.  
Clatterbuck says although not a direct consortium investor, Seacom is one of the largest users of the WACS cable system between SA and Europe.  
He points out Seacom uses the WACS cable system predominantly as a “protected” path for Seacom’s main data superhighway on Africa’s east coast – the Seacom cable system.  
“At a fundamental level, it means that if there is an outage on the Seacom cable system, then our customers’ Internet traffic is routed on the WACS cable system, and if there is an outage on the WACS cable system, as there is at the moment, then Internet traffic gets routed on the Seacom cable system,” says Clatterbuck.  
### Meshed network  
Privately-operated Seacom launched Africa’s first broadband submarine cable system along the continent’s eastern and southern coasts in 2009.  
“As Seacom is one of the largest Internet providers in Africa, we must ensure our network is affordable, reliable and of the highest quality. This means low latency or low round-trip delay, low packet loss, and data speeds that customers pay for,” says Clatterbuck.  
“To achieve this, we operate our network on a ‘meshed’ basis, meaning over multiple linear routes that are diverse from each other as best we can and, therefore, do not rely fully on any one cable path. The WACS cable system forms a core part of our meshed Internet service platform that ensures we offer an ‘always on’ and high-quality Internet experience to our customers.”  
According to Clatterbuck, the WACS cable break is affecting Seacom in two ways. “It means customers who have purchased WACS capacity from Seacom to form part of their own network backbone are now ‘hard down’ on this route, and they must be using or looking to use other routes to transmit their data traffic.  
“More importantly, it means that for Seacom’s Internet/managed services platform, we are now relying predominantly on the Seacom cable system to carry a large amount of South Africa’s international Internet traffic.”  
He adds the SAT-3 cable is also in the Seacom network backbone, but unfortunately the SAT-3 cable system is currently undergoing repairs and is not operational.  
Nonetheless, Telkom confirmed to ITWeb this morning that SAT-3 was successfully restored last night and 140GB international traffic is now available, thereby alleviating congestion.  
The SAT-3 fault was located in a similar area to a previous break in January, which was caused by a short circuit.  
“Being overly reliant on any single cable system is always a risk. However, as Seacom owns and operates the Seacom cable system itself, we are, therefore, more directly involved in its routing, repair and maintenance, giving us greater flexibility in dealing with potential outages or issues on the Seacom cable system,” Clatterbuck says.  
He adds that all Internet customers of Seacom are mitigated from the impact of the WACS outage, by being routed over the Seacom cable system as well.  
Most Seacom Internet customers will not have noticed the WACS outage, as they are routed over the Seacom cable system, he notes.  
### Re-routing traffic  
However, he says, some customers may notice longer latency as their traffic is now being routed across South Africa first (from Cape Town, for example) and then up the east coast of Africa on the Seacom cable system.  
“Furthermore, it has always been Seacom’s position to help the industry and our partners mitigate network impacts when there are cable breaks or outages on other systems. We offer as much restoration capacity as we can (temporary alternative path) to any ISP or network service provider that needs it, and we always take a position to price this fairly and on a short-term basis. As we are a private cable system, this does allow us to activate and provide restoration as quickly as possible to customers looking for restoration.”  
Clatterbuck points out the WACs cable system is very important to South Africa, as it is one of three key high-speed (multi-terabit) cables connecting SA.  
“Yes, there are only three! Seacom was the first to go live in 2009, followed by EASSy in 2010, and then WACS in 2012. So having only three international multi-terabit cable systems connecting all users in South Africa means it is never a good thing when one of them is down, as that pushes all the traffic to the other two. WACS is a critically important link for South Africa, particularly for customers in the Western Cape, but also as a key protection path for all South African customers in the event of any subsea cable outages on Africa’s east coast.”  
He also explains that many ISPs in SA are heavily reliant on the WACS cable system, as the system is a low-cost high-speed system that connects Africa to Europe on a low-latency routing.  
“Each ISP would have its own network design that might include transmission routes on WACS, EASSy, SAT-3 and the Seacom cable system to provide their customers with an Internet service.  
“If an ISP was using WACS for more than half their traffic routing, however, then their customers are likely facing congestion and poor Internet quality. We have seen reports that some of Africa’s biggest consumer ISPs are now using Seacom’s service to provide restoration and improved quality during this WACS outage.  
“It is particularly critical for customers at home to have a reliable Internet service during this period of national disaster in South Africa due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and Seacom hopes all international cable systems remain stable going forward,” Clatterbuck concludes.","The article discusses the breaking of the West Africa Cable System (WACS) submarine cable, detailing its implications for internet traffic in South Africa.

Johannesburg - Outages affecting a terrestrial network in Egypt have disrupted internet connectivity in South Africa on Thursday.

In a statement, undersea broadband cable network Seacom, which connects from South Africa to Europe, said that it's experienced a disruption in the North African country.

""Seacom is experiencing multiple outages on the terrestrial network across Egypt. All our international connectivity through Egypt has been affected since 14:06GMT (16:06 South African time) on the 21st January 2016,"" said the company earlier on Thursday.

Seacom's submarine and terrestrial networks stretch across 17,000 km, connecting Africa to Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.  
Undersea cable operator Seacom says civil construction activity in Egypt is to blame for the multiple outages which yesterday left most of Africa without Internet connectivity.  
The company has since successfully fixed its terrestrial network which experienced the glitches in the North African country.  
According to the cable operator, the Northern Trans-Egypt route was damaged between Cairo and Alexandria, while the Southern Trans-Egypt route was damaged on the outskirts of Cairo. Both events were caused by civil construction activity, it adds.  
The outages disrupted Internet connectivity in South Africa as the Seacom cable links the country to East Africa and Europe. To exacerbate the problem, the West Africa Cable System (WACS), which Seacom uses as backup, went down at the same time, leaving most African countries without Internet connectivity.  
The Seacom network uses bundled backhaul, open access points of presence, and global partnerships to provide end-to-end wholesale connectivity around the world for African network operators.  
After deploying repair teams to monitor the situation, the cable operator last night said: ""The Seacom terrestrial network was successfully repaired on the 21st January 2016 at 16:46 GMT. Seacom would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our customers, partners, and peers for their collaboration and support during the outage.  
""During the two hours and 40 minutes that Seacom experienced a dual failure across Egypt, we were able to route Internet traffic through India.""  
However, the cable operator says many operators in Africa use a basic transmission service that links directly to Europe and use the WACS as a backup. ""With the West coast experiencing an outage at the same time, international connectivity at many of these service providers failed or was degraded while we worked to repair the faults in Egypt.""  
**New network partner**  
Meanwhile, this week Seacom entered a partnership with network provider Ciena. The companies say local Internet service providers are set to benefit from the increased reach and enhanced capacity afforded by the deal.  
Both firms will deliver new network solutions with 100Gbps upgrade to service providers across Africa and into main European points of presence through key submarine links.  
""Africa is experiencing massive growth and demand for network services. With Ciena's technology supporting our infrastructure evolution, we can ensure cost-effective data connectivity to end-customers across the continent and internationally, ensuring Africa is ready for the next generation of applications and high-bandwidth broadband services,"" says Seacom's chief technology officer Claes Segelberg.  
Mark Tinka, head of engineering at Seacom, says the operator's move into mainstream 100Gbps backbone technology means it will become easier to offer high-speed 1Gbps, 10Gbps, and even 100Gbps ports and services to both Seacom's IP and transport customers.  
""Seacom's existing infrastructure has more than ample capacity to support both existing and future requirements from our current and new customers. However, the per-bit unit cost of bandwidth reduces as the amount of availability and used capacity increases. Moreover, energy and space constraints mean it is more efficient to purchase 100Gbps technology instead of 10x 10Gbps, for example,"" Tinka explains.","The article titled ""Seacom blames civil construction for outages"" discusses how civil construction activities in Egypt caused damage to Seacom's submarine cable routes, specifically the Northern and Southern Trans-Egypt routes.

Johannesburg - Internet users in South Africa were left frustrated for two hours and forty minutes on Thursday, January 21 amid a disruption on two undersea cables.

Subsea broadband cable Seacom, which stretches along Africa’s eastern coastline and connects to Europe, experienced ""multiple outages"" on a terrestrial network across Egypt.

The outages - which were caused by a fibre cut in Egypt - started at 14:06GMT (16:06 South African time) on Thursday and was then repaired at 16:46 GMT (18:46 South African time), said Seacom.

But while the outage affected Seacom, another disruption hit a major undersea cable along Africa’s western coastline: Wacs (West Africa Cable System). Reports indicate that a fault in the UK affected this particular cable.

Internet service provider MWEB, in an update to its customers, described the situation on Thursday as a ""total loss of international bandwidth"".

This was caused by failures on both the Seacom and Wacs undersea cables which run along the east and west coasts of Africa respectively. The likelihood of a failure on both cables at the same time is extremely low but unfortunately it happened, and most service providers in South Africa were affected as a result.

Two years ago the Brisbane based company SubPartners invited the Government to chip in $20 million to tap into the latest arm of its global digital cable network.

The company had intended laying a submarine cable from Perth to Sydney and suggested a spur could be built to connect Tasmania either at Hobart or George Town.

It is part of SubPartners' major plan to build the APX-Central (Perth to Sydney), APX-West (Perth to Singapore) and APX-East (Sydney to US) fibre optic submarine cables.

Technology Minister Michael Ferguson commissioned a consultant to assess the business case for $180,000, but SubPartners never followed through.

""I don't think it's really appropriate to be rushing into these things, when there's not yet a proposal before us,"" Mr Ferguson said.

SubPartners has reportedly experienced delays gaining the necessary permits and securing key customers and investors.

""Until such time as an offer is received from SubPartners, the Government does not have clarity on commercial models or what rights that SubPartners and the Government and/or private investors would have in respect of the operation or resale of data capacity on a Tasmanian branch spur,"" he said.

Bass Strait cable competition hopes dashed
------------------------------------------

The lack of progress has dashed industry hopes that the extra cable would create more competition and bring down internet prices.

Consumer groups had also urged the government to invest in the cable to ensure there would be no repeat of the crippling internet speeds caused when the Basslink undersea cable was cut for repairs last month.

A digital consumers group told a Senate inquiry in Hobart on Thursday that the recent cutting of cable led to ""seven days of internet hell"".

Abe Ydy who makes TV and radio commercials in Launceston saw his work grind to a virtual halt.

""It dramatically slowed down our NBN access, slower than dial-up almost in that we couldn't access any of our cloud-based service,"" he told The World Today.

""We transferred large amounts of audio, large amounts of data files, we couldn't do any transfer, we could access our FTP programs.

""We essentially couldn't operate, it was like cutting the power so to speak.""

He has since switched to Telstra which owns the other fibre-optic cable that connects Tasmania to the mainland.

"Opportunities from Vocus' $861M Nextgen Acquisition","$861M acquisition enhancing subsea cable infrastructure, improving internet connectivity through Australia-Singapore and North West Cable Systems.","https://www.itnews.com.au/news/the-juiciest-opportunities-from-vocus-861m-nextgen-buy-430058","2016-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","Ry Crozier",Yes,"Ry Crozier","St Leonards, New South Wales, Australia","4250","2016-07-04","English","iTnews","**The juiciest opportunities from Vocus' $861m Nextgen buy**  
Vocus' $861 million Nextgen buyout will give it immediate NBN backhaul muscle, access to Australia's top LNG projects, and the chance to reinvigorate its Perth-Singapore cable play.  
  
The ASX-listed company this week made a major bid for Nextgen Networks' terrestrial dark fibre and subsea cable projects.  
  
In an interview with _iTnews_, Vocus CEO Geoff Horth revealed how the company plans to revive the fortunes of the Australia-Singapore Cable (ASC) project.  
  
In addition, Horth outlined how the Nextgen buy will open doors for Vocus in Australia's gas-rich north-west, and - for a small additional capital investment - make Vocus a major new player in the NBN points of interconnect (PoI) backhaul space.  
  
**Australian-Singapore cable**  
Vocus will now resume selling prospective customers on the Australia-Singapore Cable after several months spent “hamstrung” by negotiations to buy out its joint venture partner on the project.  
  
The buyout, if successful, will give Vocus full control of the 4600km Australia-Singapore Cable (ASC) project that it revived late last year as a 50-50 joint venture with Nextgen.  
  
Horth told _iTnews_ the project remains contingent on securing customer commitments to buy capacity on the cable, which will run from Perth to Singapore.  
  
“We won’t do that project without the appropriate customer backing,” Horth said.  
  
“We’ve been a little bit hamstrung because it was a joint venture with Nextgen, and over the last couple of months it’s been a little bit hard for us to go and talk to prospective customers because we’ve been in negotiations with Nextgen’s owners to buy the business.  
  
“We’ll now press on with that.”  
  
ASC is one of three projects vying to lay a Perth-to-Singapore subsea cable that would compete with the existing SEA-ME-WE3 link on the route.  
  
Competing projects include SubPartners’ APX-West – which recently switched to a consortium model with Telstra and Optus to try to get an edge – and Trident Subsea Cable, which is trying to secure a final round of finance.  
  
Horth said ASC is “technically advanced”, having completed marine surveys, secured landing permits and with “most requirements in place” barring enough commitments to see the build progress.  
  
“Obviously there’s a number of competing projects,” he said.  
  
“My view is there’s a good potential return but there’s only enough demand for one to succeed.  
  
“We wouldn’t build unless we can secure some customer commitments.”  
  
Vocus has said the estimated cost of ASC is around US$130 million (A$174 million).  
  
The company isn’t paying anything upfront to take full ownership of ASC, but is required to pay US$20 million (A$27 million) to Nextgen if construction commences or if it decides to exit the project – for example, to participate in a rival project on the route.  
  
**Tapping the north-west**  
Vocus’ buyout of Nextgen also includes the handover of the North West Cable System (NWCS) project – a subsea route between Port Hedland and Darwin designed to service mostly liquefied natural gas (LNG) rigs tapping the north-west shelf.  
  
The base business case for NWCS was to provide the connectivity being demanded by LNG and resources operators to power automated systems at their sites.  
  
NWCS is expected to come online in October. The cable has been laid and – as of February this year – brought to shore at both ends.  
  
The time between now and October will be spent on end-to-end testing of the cable system and making the final connections between customers’ rigs and nearby branching units on the cable.  
  
The foundation customers are Inpex for its Ichthys project and Shell for its Prelude project.  
  
“By the time we take ownership of the asset it’ll be operational for the two cornerstone customers,” Horth said. “It gets handed over to us ready for service.""  
  
Vocus is proposing to make a US$80 million (A$107 million) upfront payment to Nextgen for NWCS, with a further US$20 million (A$27 million) “conditional on certain customer commitments being reached”.  
  
In financial filings, Vocus indicated it would take ownership of the asset for well below what it cost to build. Horth said he was unable to reveal by what margin.  
  
There appears to be a lot of potential upside in NWCS for Vocus.  
  
“It has a significant number of branching units,” Horth said, without being drawn on exactly how many.  
  
“They’ve created branching units for all the likely possible new customer opportunities including other rigs and potentially into other areas of the north-west.  
  
“It’s definitely future-proofed.”  
  
When NWCS comes online, Darwin will act as the main point for traffic on the subsea cable to interconnect with terrestrial networks.  
  
Though the cable also lands in Port Hedland, Nextgen had only proposed a project to then run a terrestrial fibre link from there down to Geraldton, where it could interconnect with existing fibre into Perth or other capitals.  
  
Horth said Vocus will “explore” a terrestrial link from Port Hedland to Geraldton to complete the north-west fibre loop, but said it would “come down to us getting appropriate customer commitments”.  
  
“We are dealing with some of the resource companies up in the Pilbara to see whether there’s an appetite for that project,” he said.  
  
“If we can get the customer funding we’ll build it and it would complete the loop.”  
  
**Becoming a bigger PoI player**  
The Nextgen deal also provides Vocus a way to inexpensively connect to NBN’s network of regional points of interconnect (PoIs).  
  
Vocus’ current on-net coverage is 68 NBN PoIs, courtesy of its metro fibre assets.  
  
“Vocus has a pretty significant metropolitan fibre footprint in all the mainland capital cities, which gets you to most of the metro PoIs,” Horth said.  
  
This contrasts with Nextgen, whose network connects mostly regional centres and therefore passes closeby NBN’s regional PoIs.  
  
Vocus said in financial filings that for an estimated $11.5 million, it would be able to deploy fibre runs from the Nextgen network to these regional PoIs, boosting its on-net PoI connectivity to 112 of a total 121.  
  
“The great surprise in this deal is that with a reasonably modest level of capital we can run fibre to connect into 112 PoIs,” Horth said.  
  
“It’s a pretty significant strategic outcome for the business.”  
  
Vocus said connecting to the remaining nine PoIs would be economically unviable.  
  
In any event, Vocus has some off-net connectivity to all 121 PoIs using Telstra capacity under a deal brokered by M2 to power its NBN Connect product. Vocus and M2 merged earlier this year.  
  
“We’ll still be utilising that capacity from Telstra,” Horth said.  
  
“The fibre for the 112 PoIs that Vocus will connect to directly will be used to cater for expected growth in capacity and to service our wholesale and our corporate business.  
  
“For a fixed price, we’ll have almost unlimited capacity with those 112 PoIs and that’s complementary to the deal we did with Telstra.","The article discusses Vocus' involvement with subsea cables, including the Australia-Singapore Cable (ASC) and the North West Cable System (NWCS).

It elaborates on the implications of these cables for internet connectivity and telecommunications, particularly in relation to Vocus' business strategy.

While not exclusively focused on cut sea cables, the topic is treated as significant within the context of Vocus' operations, making it a central theme rather than a minor mention."

""Etisalat has been informed by the international service providers that repairs to damaged cables are presently underway and will be completed over a three-week period,"" the UAE operator said in a statement to _IT Weekly_ this week.  

""During this time, certain bandwidth-intensive, (non-http) applications such as online gaming and peer to peer applications will be moderately affected due to traffic prioritisation steps taken by Etisalat,"" the operator added.  

Etisalat confirmed that it had experienced temporary drops in internet service quality in the immediate aftermath of the undersea earthquake, which registered 7.1 on the Richter scale and which killed two people.  

The quake, which occurred on December 26, resulted in massive damage to seven of the eight major undersea fiber-optic communication cables near southern Taiwan.  

Etisalat said it coped with the disaster by tapping into its contingency excess capacity and by making use of additional bandwidth allocated to it by other service providers.  

The operator said its team worked round the clock to monitor and ensure traffic prioritisation and allocation of greater resources to critical internet-based applications and services.

Johannesburg - Undersea broadband cable provider Seacom has been hit by a fault in the Mediterranean Sea between Egypt and France, possibly impacting connectivity in Africa.  
Seacom operates an undersea broadband cable that connects from South Africa to Europe and Asia along Africa’s eastern coastline.  
And Seacom said in a network update on Monday that it is “experiencing a shunt fault in the Mediterranean Sea” at 14:00 GMT, which was about 16:00 South African time Monday.  
A shunt fault occurs when the insulation of an undersea cable is damaged and its metallic core makes contact with seawater.  
“The impact of the incident is that all transmission traffic on the East Coast of Africa to and from Europe will be affected,” said the company.  
Seacom further explained that customers with internet protocol (IP) services will remain “unaffected” but could experience “higher latencies”.  
Higher latencies mean that internet traffic takes longer to route around a network.  
Seacom further explained that its traffic would be routed via the West African Cable System (WACS) and the company’s network to its Asia gateways.  
“To repair this shunt fault, a service-affecting planned activity has been scheduled from the 19th October to the 28th October 2016,” said Seacom in its update.  
“A repair vessel has been mobilised and will reach the fault location by the 19th October. Due to the nature of the activity, which largely depends on weather and other sea conditions, the planned work window may vary.”

The investigation was launched after two cables were severed in the Baltic Sea last week.

Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has requested that a Chinese ship return to Swedish waters as part of an ongoing investigation into the damage of two subsea cable systems in the Baltic Sea last week.

Last Sunday, the 218km BCS East-West Interlink cable, which connects Gotland, Sweden, and Lithuania, was damaged and taken offline. The next day, the C-lion-1 cable between Helsinki, Finland, and Rostock, Germany, was also severed. This cable is the only direct link between Finland and mainland Europe.

European governments said at the time that they feared the damage was an intentional act of sabotage on behalf of malicious state actors and started an immediate investigation. As the damage to both affected cables occurred in Sweden’s exclusive economic zone (the area of the sea to which a country has exclusive rights), this investigation is being led by a team of Swedish prosecutors.

Following the initial phases of investigation, it was quickly discovered that the Chinese bulk carrier ship Yi Peng 3 was in the area at the time the cable damage occurred. As such, Swedish authorities are now requesting that Yi Peng 3 returns to Swedish waters to cooperate with investigators.

The Chinese ship is currently anchored in international waters within Denmark’s exclusive economic zone.

“From the Swedish side we have had contact with the ship and contact with China and said that we want the ship to move towards Swedish waters,” PM Kristersson told a press conference this week.

The PM was keen to stress that, at this stage, there is no accusation of malice, but that “this is the second time in a relatively short period of time that there have been serious physical cable breaches.”

This is in reference to an incident in October last year, when a gas pipeline and submarine telecoms cable connecting Finland and Estonia were both severely damaged.

Customers of TPG Telecom in Australia are battling slow Internet services due to a major fiber fault in its international submarine cable. TPG's fiber cable fault occurred over the weekend as the Internet service provider's Sydney-Guam submarine cable suffered a major setback.

On Friday, the cable which is operated by Pipe (TPG's subsidiary) went down per the fault notice posted by the operator. The PPC-1 submarine cable line between Guam and Sydney is the one affected by the fault, which has taken down the 4,287 mile-long cable.

""At approximately 20:00:10 AEDT on Feb. 5, 2016, the TPG Network Operations Centre received multiple alarms for the PPC-1 cable system between Sydney and Guam,"" states the TPG notice. ""The alarms indicated that a submarine line card had lost its payload. A Network Incident ticket was created and the issue was immediately escalated to the PPC-1 transmission engineering team.""

The operator has revealed that the Transmission engineering team — in tandem with infrastructure vendors — has conducted preliminary investigations and found that a fiber fault existed nearly 2,852 miles from Guam.

Australian subscribers of the service will be facing slow Internet due to the unforeseen problem. In the interim, the Australian-Japan Cable system and the Southern Cross Cable will be deployed to route traffic and used as substitutes said the TPG Telecom.

**When Will The Issue Be Resolved?**

The outage is expected to last a while and will not be fixed before March. Initially, it was anticipated that the outage will take a little over a month to be sorted — the repair date is said to be March 7 — but since repair crews are occupied with another job, it is not known when the fault will be resolved.

The maintenance ship that the TPG Telecom has a contract with to rectify the submarine cable faults is currently engaged in fixing the Basslink cable system, which is between contracted Victoria and Tasmania.

Key points:

* Repair ship's crew hopes calm conditions last long enough to complete repairs
* Basslink says cable will still be fixed by mid-June
* Business executives urge more testing to determine the cause of the fault

Last month, cable experts removed the damaged section of the Basslink power cable, but rough conditions prevented the repair ship returning to the fault site to finish the job.

After three weeks of delay, the ship was finally able to leave Geelong last night and the repair team hopes calm conditions will last long enough to connect a new section of cable to the existing one.

The repair team needs 16 calm days to work on the cable before it can be up and running again.

Despite the weather delays, Basslink maintains it can still meet the return to service date of mid-June.

What caused the cable to fail in December remains unknown, which is causing concern for major industrials.

Cause of fault needs to be established: Mostogl

Bell Bay Aluminium general manager Ray Mostogl said it was impossible to know the likelihood of another outage without knowing what went wrong.

""There's an element of doubt that when the cable gets connected, we'd be back in the situation in six months, 12 months, five years, 10 years,"" he said.

Basslink is awaiting a report from independent experts tests on the faulty section.

The faulty section of the Basslink power cable was removed in March.

The aluminium smelter has reached an agreement with Hydro Tasmania to ramp up to full production after operating at 10 per cent less capacity for five months to save power during the energy crisis.

Mr Mostogl said it was too early to determine how much the energy-saving measures cost the business, but he expected it would be less than the $20 million first predicted.

He called for a thorough analysis of what led to the energy crisis to ensure the business was not placed in a similar position again.

""It's not a matter of trying to apportion blame,"" he said.

""It's really about understanding what were the mechanisms that has led to this and what could we have done about it differently.""

He said a long-term energy security plan would be crucial to the business's long term future in Tasmania.

""That's what our customers will be asking for as well, they will be asking for some certainty in terms of supply,"" he said.

**Published Date:** 03/28/2016  

Tasmania's long-suffering electricity and Internet users – in other words, nearly everyone – will have to wait until mid-June for a fix to the Basslink power and optical fibre cables.

The company has announced that it's pinpointed the fault on its electricity cables, just 1,150 metres from where it cut the cable for investigation. That, the company says, is a miss of less than 0.4 per cent of the total cable length.

However, the fault (which is still under investigation) has done so much damage that the electricity cable will need three joints to return to operation. ""The degree of water ingress into the cable through the fault has resulted in more damaged cable that needs to be replaced, which will see a third joint required on the cable"", the statement says.

""In simple terms, water got in and damaged the cable – this now needs to be removed. Consequently, an additional mobilisation phase is required in Geelong to restock the vessel with cable to complete the jointing phase to connect the additional replacement cable"".

That, plus the need for a stretch of clear weather to conduct repair operations, lies behind the company's conservative estimate of a repair date.

The cable ship _Ile de Ré_ is on its way back to Geelong for 10 days' preparation for the jointing work.

Because the Basslink optical fibre cable was laid alongside the electrical cable, it had to be cut for repairs to begin. This has left subscribers on TPG's iiNet and Internode complaining about slow connection speeds.

As a result, Taswegian broadband subscribers to Telstra's competitors are throwing fits at what they're describing as an Internet brownout, with even NBN subscribers complaining that they're barely able to achieve 1 Mbps download speeds.

With the cable now cut – and likely out of commission until May – Telstra is now the only game in town, and while backhaul prices from Tasmania are capped by a service declaration from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, it seems TPG is unwilling to buy as much from Telstra as it had been buying from Basslink.

Digital Tasmania said after the first 24 hours without Basslink, capacity was strained no matter what access network the consumer was trying to use.

Tasmania's minister for technology and innovation Michael Ferguson has urged Telstra's competitors to buy more backhaul from Telstra. Ferguson notes that wholesale prices are capped by ACCC service declarations.

Internode has posted this explanation to its customers. The company says Telstra Wholesale has committed to configuring extra bandwidth for iiNet/Internode customers by Thursday March 17, after which it will contact customers regarding rebates.

What caused the Basslink electrical and data cable failure isn't yet known but it's becoming a political storm in the state. When the cable was built, the state government expected most of the time it would be helping Hydro Tasmania export the state's green power to the mainland. Now, according to _The Mercury_, Basslink is accusing Hydro Tasmania of exceeding the cable's safe operating parameters, because the lucrative trade selling green power to the mainland was irresistible.

The cable will be lifted to the surface in the next week, weather permitting. It will then be cut, tested and capped to prevent moisture getting in, a process which is expected to take another fortnight.

Mr Eccles said it was a complex operation which required ""great care and consideration"". ""The consequences of a hasty and ill-considered decision will be far-reaching,"" Mr Eccles said.

Repair crews are still unsure where the fault in Tasmania's vital undersea cable is days after cutting it, Basslink chief executive Malcolm Eccles says.

**Key points:**
- Crews don't know exactly where fault is on 200km stretch of cable
- Repairs costing at least $100,000 per day
- Basslink reconsidering telecommunications role

A fault in the cable has plunged Tasmania into an energy crisis compounded by record low rainfall which left the state's hydro dams critically low.

The Basslink cable was bringing about 40 per cent of Tasmania's power to the state but a fault put it out of action in December.

About 9:15pm on Friday, Basslink severed the cable as it began repairs. It is not expected to be fully fixed until May.

Mr Eccles told 936 ABC Hobart the fault was somewhere between the cut 89 kilometres off the Tasmanian coast and Victoria.

""We don't know until we actually start to do the next phase of testing,"" he said.

""We need the weather window to be able to lift the cable to put it on the deck of the vessel and then we have to carry out a number of tests.

Divers cut the Basslink cable at 9:15pm on Friday as repairs began on the broken interconnector.

""And only then after we've done those tests will we know if we're 200 metres, 500 metres, a kilometre from where the cable was cut.""

Mr Eccles said he was confident there would not be a long stretch of cable that needed to be replaced.

He said the vessel being used in the repair job was very expensive.

""If you've got a submarine cable which is 300 kilometres and you need to fix it it's $100,000 a day for a vessel, minimum,"" he said.

""The repair costs are phenomenal.""

The Tasmanian Government is moving to set up a parliamentary inquiry to examine the circumstances leading to the state's energy crisis.

Opposition Leader Bryan Green told Parliament a taskforce, to be headed by former Hydro Tasmania boss Geoff Willis to examine the Basslink failure, was tantamount to ""picking your own jury"".

Basslink also carries fibre optic cable as well as its power infrastructure.

It is used by a number of non-Telstra affiliated internet service providers (ISPs), but that service stopped when the cable was cut.

That left about one third of Tasmania's internet users with very slow or ""unusable"" internet speeds.

Telstra operates its own undersea cables which it said had ""more than enough"" capacity to provide affected ISPs the bandwidth they need.

But Basslink said the terms offered by Telstra were ""completely uncommercial"" leaving the ISPs to negotiate the service separately.

The degraded service prompted an angry response from customers who felt they were not warned about the outage.

Mr Eccles said his company's primary business was power and it may reconsider its telecommunications role in the future.

""We've always said it's got to be a viable business for us, the moment it becomes unviable...then it would be unfair to our shareholders to actually continue.""

That could also mean a price increase for customers.

""We are requesting a fair price for the use of our asset,"" Mr Eccles said.

""Submarine cable infrastructure is several times more expensive than land based infrastructure.

""I'm really over listening to people talking about a subsea fibre optic like it's a mainland fibre optic, the cost of repair is absolutely enormous.""","The article discusses a fault in the Basslink undersea cable, which has significant implications for both energy supply and internet connectivity in Tasmania.

It mentions the cable directly and explores the consequences of its failure, including the impact on internet speeds for users.

The central theme of the article revolves around the challenges of repairing this submarine cable and the associated costs, making it relevant to the topic of cut sea cables."

Submarine cable builder SubPartners has switched to a consortium model for its Perth to Singapore subsea cable system and partnered with Telstra and SingTel to finally get the long-running project off the ground.  
  
The APX-West project has been in motion for the past three years.  
In 2013, Telstra signed its first non-binding memorandum of understanding to buy one of four planned fibre pairs on the cable system.  
But SubPartners' previous plan to own and operate the cable system while allowing others to buy capacity saw it struggle to obtain seed funding to get the build started.  
Over the past few years it has reworked its approach to a consortium model where each player provides funding for their portion of cable build and is responsible for the operation and maintenance of their section of the system once live.  
This approach proved more successful and has now seen Telstra, Optus parent SingTel and several other unnamed parties sign up and invest in the cable's build. SubPartners will also own, operate and fund an undisclosed portion of APX-West.  
It declined to provide the financial details of the arrangement.  
But SubPartners CEO Bevan Slattery told iTnews funding levels would be proportionate to each player's respective capacity.  
The cable build overall is expected to cost in excess of US$100 million.  
""All the major players [will have] access to ownership economics at a fraction of the cost of private cable ownership,"" Slattery said in a statement.  
""This is a unique commercial model for the Perth-Singapore route that will satisfy the ongoing bandwidth requirements of both network operators and internet content hosts.”  
Slattery also said the growth of Singapore as a cloud and interconnection hub for the APAC region, combined with recent submarine cable outages and the lack of extra capacity on the existing SEA-ME-WE 3 cable had ""crystalised the benefits"" of APX-West.  
""Ultimately the commercial construct, the reworked design and timing was right,"" he said.  
With funding for the build secured, construction is scheduled to commence before July this year and be complete by 2018.  
The cable system has been downgraded from four fibre pairs to two, with minimum capacity now planned at 20Tbps compared to an initial 32Tbps.  
Slattery said the company was using new technology which allowed each individual party to ""light"" their own spectrum- ""almost like 'virtual fibre pairs'"", he said.  
  
**No more NextDC**  
APX-West will span 4500km from Perth to Singapore and carry two-way data transmission traffic. It will be built by United States cable layer TE Subcom.  
SubPartners had previously said the APX-West cable system - alongside its APX-Central subsea cable connecting Perth to Sydney - would land in NextDC's P1 data centre in Perth.  
But Slattery today revealed the cable system would no longer land at the NextDC facility.  
He declined to provide further detail due to the ""confidential"" nature of the new landing location, but indicated the cable would terminate in facilities operated by Telstra, SingTel and SubPartners in both Singapore and Australia.  
APX-West's main competitor will be the existing SEA-ME-WE 3 cable, which is the sole current data bridge between Perth and Singapore.  
There are two further proposed builds by Vocus and NextGen and Huawei Marine Networks (ASSC-1), the latter which folded into Trident Subsea Cable's similar efforts in the region. Both projects have so far struggled to access funding for the builds.  
Telstra in 2012 invested in a fibre pair on the ASSC-1 cable.","The article discusses the Perth to Singapore subsea cable project and mentions submarine cable outages, which are relevant to the topic of cut sea cables.

As a result, for the last 4 days, people including the internet service providers of the country are experiencing slow internet. Meanwhile, Bangladesh Submarine Cables PLC (BSCPLC) said that the repair work of the submarine cable can be completed by the last week of May. BSCPLC General Manager (Operation and Maintenance) Saidur Rahman revealed the news on Tuesday.

He said that the SEA-ME-WE-5 cable was cut in the sea area of Indonesia at midnight last Friday. Their administrative work there takes a little more time. All in all, they said, the work can be done by the third or fourth week of next month.

Saidur Rahman stated that not all available options have been fully implemented yet. The country's inaugural submarine cable, SEA-ME-WE-4, possesses the capability to handle the full bandwidth. However, the associated company would need to incur additional costs for its activation, a step that has not yet been taken.

Nonetheless, progress is underway with other available options.

It has been revealed that the country currently enjoys 1600 Gbps bandwidth through the SEA-ME-WE-5 cable. Unfortunately, the second submarine cable encountered a disruption approximately 440 km west of Singapore on Friday, leading to its complete shutdown. This issue has not only impacted Bangladesh but has also affected several other nations. Consequently, efforts are underway to establish an alternative system utilizing the SEA-ME-WE-4 cable. Notably, Bangladesh's initial submarine cable, SEA-ME-WE-4, has a landing station in Cox's Bazar, while the second submarine cable, SEA-ME-WE-5, enters through Kuakata.

In response to the decommissioning of SEA-ME-WE-5, a considerable portion of the bandwidth is being transferred to the SEA-ME-WE-4 cable to ensure continued connectivity.","The article discusses the SEA-ME-WE-5 submarine cable that has been cut, leading to slow internet services in Bangladesh.

This infrastructure will strengthen the international internet connection that Algeria already has through the Alger-Palma (Italy) and Annaba-Marseille (France) cables. This new cable will prevent the country from facing reduced internet capacity again in case of an incident affecting one of its other fiber optic cables, as happened in 2015 with the SEA-ME-WE 4 cable cut.

In addition to serving as a security infrastructure in case of problems, this submarine fiber optic cable will also contribute to gradually lowering the cost of high-speed internet access in the country. The deployment works for this equipment began in November 2015, with a duration of 14 months, and are estimated at 26 million dollars.

It should be noted that the submarine fiber optic cable connecting Algeria to Spain consists of two sections. Besides the Oran-Valencia section, there is the Algiers-Valencia section. The deployment works also began last November, with a duration of 14 months, estimated at 10 million dollars.

If you are in the United States or any location overseas and trying to call loved ones in Palau, do not be alarmed if your call is not received or responded to, the internet in Palau is inaccessible during this time.

Palau connects to the rest of the world via submarine cable. “Since Belau Submarine Cable Corporation (BSCC)’s Palau Cable Network No 1 connects to SEA–US for onward transport to Guam, BSCC will be unable to provide service for the duration of the repair. BSCC will be unable to provide any international connectivity for Palau,” announced the joint press release from BSCC and PNCC yesterday.

The SEA–US cable network is under emergency repair as several cables at the SEA-US cable landing at PITI, Guam, were extensively damaged. The cause of the damage is not yet confirmed, but it is suspected that it may have been caused by Supertyphoon Mawar, which hit Guam in May of this year.

The joint press release from Belau Submarine Cable Corporation (BSCC) and Palau National Communications Corporation (PNCC) states, “For safety reasons, repairs can only be undertaken when the cable is not powered,” explaining the reason for the outage.

Meanwhile, Palau National Communications Corporation (PNCC), through satellite connection, will provide only limited capacity compared to normal cable service. “Only limited internet services will be provided through PNCC’s satellite backup services for essential government services such as police, fire and rescue, hospital, Judiciary and limited access for local banks to enable internet access for their ATM as well as card swipe machines at some locations,” announced the joint press release.

“Essential services will have access to basic internet connectivity over PNCC’s backup satellite to ensure they can continue to function.”

It added, “During the submarine fiber outage, all PNCC customers will be able to access local and international Voice and SMS on both mobile and fixed lines. Customers will not have access to either Mobile Data or fixed line internet services.”

PHILIPSBURG--The TelEm Group is excited to announce the successful restoration of its SMPR-1 undersea cable, which has been out of commission for nearly eight years. The repair work, conducted at Playa Isla Verde, San Juan, Puerto Rico, was completed despite challenging weather conditions, including the threat of Tropical Storm Ernesto.

Over the past three weeks, the specialised cable-laying vessel “CS Wave Sentinel” braved rough seas to complete the crucial repair. The operation faced significant hurdles, but on August 10, 2024, the SMPR-1 cable was successfully returned to the sea floor, spliced and reinforced with additional shielding.

TelEm Group Network Engineer and SMPR-1 Project Manager Jed Carty played a pivotal role in overseeing the repair. Carty, who monitored the process from the “Blue Manta” and maintained constant communication with the “CS Wave Sentinel”, reported daily to the executive directors.

Interim Chief Technology Officer Shairon Offerman was quick to commend Carty and the team for their perseverance under tough conditions. TelEm Group Chief Executive Officer Kendall Dupersoy and Chief Financial Officer Randell F. Hato also expressed their gratitude and congratulations following the successful repair.

"New Submarine Cables Enhancing Internet Speed in UAE","Discusses recent submarine cable cuts affecting connectivity; highlights new cables expected to improve internet speed significantly.","https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/new-submarine-cables-to-bring-faster-internet-to-uae-1.94671","2016-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","Emmanuel Samoglou",Yes,"Emmanuel Samoglou","Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","15000","2016-04-20","English","The National","ABU DHABI // Faster, and possibly cheaper, internet could be in store for residents following the expected completion of a number of regional submarine telecommunication cable projects this year.

“From the end-users perspective, which is through your mobile, you will have a faster speed,” said Omar Jassim bin Kalban, managing director and chief executive of E-marine, a Dubai-based submarine cable and installation company.

“It would also give a chance to the operators to consider a revision of the price, however, it’s up to them.”

The extra bandwidth could provide UAE internet providers lower per unit data costs, which they could then transfer on to consumers.

The infrastructure upgrade currently in the works could also help handle a predicted rise in data usage coming from consumers using data heavy applications such as movie streaming and, further down the road, as 5G mobile networks are developed and deployed.

Residents have previously complained about internet pricing and not being able to reach the highest available speeds. Twitter users also voiced concern over the video quality of streaming services.

The cables will increase the amount of data flowing in and out of the UAE and create “better connectivity between the regional countries and to the outside world”, said Mr bin Kalban.

E-marine – a wholly owned subsidiary of Etisalat – is involved in many of the projects, including a 20,000-kilometre cable system under construction that stretches from Singapore to France called “Sea-Me-We 5” that includes a UAE connection.

“In the UAE this year, I expect they will land four international submarine cables, stretching all the way from Europe and the Far East,” he said. “Etisalat and du, are putting in huge investments to land more and more cables.”

In the next 10 years, bandwidth capacity will be four times the current capacity, he said.

Nearly all the internet data that travels across the world's oceans is transmitted through submarine cables rather than satellite communication systems.

Cables are specially constructed to withstand the harsh environment on the sea floor, including the pressure of having kilometres of water above them.

But they are also susceptible to natural disasters – several were affected by the 2011 earthquake in Japan. They can also be the focus of sabotage. In 2003, Egypt’s navy captured three scuba divers trying to cut an undersea internet cable in the Mediterranean.

In January, du notified customers about multiple submarine cuts to a cable in the Red Sea off the coast of Egypt, of which E-marine played a role in fixing. The cause was never revealed.

Mr bin Kalban said the UAE’s infrastructure is set up to mitigate any potential disruption.

“In case of damage, you will never have 100 per cent failure as there is a diversity in routing which will guarantee that most of the traffic is maintained at the same quality of service.”

E-marine is the host of this week’s SubOptic 2016 conference – an event for the submarine cable industry.

**UAE is the perfect location for internet hub**  

While it is often called cyberspace, the internet is, for the most part, a physically connected system.

While some remote areas of the globe require satellites for internet, much of the world gets their service from cables installed deep on the seabed floor that contain the optical fibres which transmit the data.

The strategic geographic position that played a role in the UAE’s economic development long before the internet became part of everyday life will see it become a regional data hub.

The country is also home to E-Marine – a company that claims to have become “one of the market leaders in submarine cable installation, maintenance and repair services”.

With a fleet of four specially equipped ships and 12-tonne robots that can operate in waters as deep 2,500 metres, the company handles the bulk of installation and cable maintenance in the region.

The ships and robots, with complex propulsion systems, can even work in rough sea conditions.

A number of projects are underway to increase connectivity in the UAE, which could potentially provide benefits for residents and the business community.

“They look at submarine cables as an integral part of a country’s infrastructure,” said Omar bin Kalban, E-marine’s managing director and chief executive.

“They are important to attract foreign investment, tourism, and education.”

He said that the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) was also studying plans to further increase bandwidth.

The TRA, he said, was taking measures to ensure infrastructure was in place for an expected surge of data out of the UAE, as a number of global firms are eyeing the UAE as their “regional hub” for data traffic.

**Key points:**

* ISPs use fibre-optic within Basslink cable for services in Tasmania
* Basslink cut the cable Friday night to begin repairs
* Internet users furious at slow service

Tasmanians have reported slow internet speeds after repairs began on the faulty Basslink cable.

The undersea link is used to import and export some power as well as fibre-optic internet between Tasmania and Victoria, and has been out of action since December.

About 9:15pm on Friday, Basslink severed the cable as it began repairs. It is not expected to be fully fixed until May.

Telstra has two of its own undersea cables.

The ABC understands Telstra offered Basslink a deal a month ago to provide capacity to its internet service providers (ISPs), including iiNet.

But Basslink said the terms being offered by Telstra at that time were ""completely uncommercial"".

The ISPs now have to negotiate separately with Telstra.

iiNet is one of the internet providers experiencing disruptions to service speeds.

In a statement on Facebook, the company said it was unclear how long the disruption would last.

""During this repair process iiNet customers will experience a degraded service with capacity on the links that transfer telecommunication services to the region reduced,"" it said.

""We have implemented an alternate solution for the duration of these repairs, however it is important to note this will provide limited capacity for iiNet customers.""

iiNet said affected customers would be contacted for applicable downtime credits to their normal billing.

Internode customers are also affected.

**Web browsing possible, but very sluggish**

iiNet and Internode provide up to 40 per cent of the market in Tasmania.

Consumer advocacy group Digital Tasmania said speeds seemed to have improved since peak times on Friday night.

""To look at video and other content out of Tasmania it was getting very slow with a lot of buffering and the circle going along there,"" Andrew Connor from Digital Tasmania said.

""Web browsing is still possible but very sluggish compared to normal, especially on the NBN.

""It's like a pipe, you're trying to push a certain amount of water or pressure through it and if that pipe's only big enough, the flow is going to slow down for everyone that's using it.""

iiNet provides internet services for most of the Tasmanian public sector.

Minister for Technology and Innovation Michael Ferguson said the Government had ensured enough capacity had been arranged for government, education and research customers.

""[The] Government is advised that there is still ample capacity,"" he said.

**'I tried to download a file, it took 12 hours'**

Tony Harrison runs a communications company between Hobart and Melbourne.

""It was difficult I was trying to download a file about 280 megabyte file, it took 12 hours to download, now that's a bit of a problem it would normally take about 15 minutes,"" he said.

""We received a notice yesterday, which was a bit late I guess, we anticipated there might be a hiccup but then I do recall Minister Ferguson saying there'd be no problem earlier in the year, that there'd be plenty of capacity.

""Well, yesterday shows that if there is plenty of capacity we don't have access to it.

""It's just a matter of the internet providers reaching an agreement with Telstra and that's what really needs to be done as a matter of urgency and I'd urge the powers that be to step in and make sure that happens as quickly as possible.""

Basslink's repair teams will continue testing parts of the cut cable to isolate the fault - a process which could take up to two weeks.

Basslink has also warned the process will likely be disrupted by weather conditions, with swells and waves posing a hazard to crews.

CEO Malcolm Eccles said the first cut to the cable was a major step forward.

""After working round the clock since the outage, we are pleased to reach this important milestone,"" he said.

Bangladesh Submarine Cables Company has expressed sincere apologies for the temporary inconvenience to its customers.

The internet disruption due to a cut in the country's second submarine cable at Kuakata is likely to continue for at least 4-5 days, according to Bangladesh submarine cable authorities.

The submarine cable SEA-ME-WE 5, which is the source of 1700 GBPS bandwidth, is not allowing any data traffic after it was cut 440km west of Singapore at 12am on Friday.

""The international consortium is looking for a special purpose ship that is a must for the restoration of the undersea cable,"" Mirza Kamal Ahmed, managing director (additional charge) of the Bangladesh Submarine Cables PLC, told The Business Standard.

""No one can specify the exact duration,"" he said, adding, ""Based on past cases, it is likely to require a minimum of 4-5 days.""

However, internet service has been kept running with the help of the country's first submarine cable SEA-ME-WE-4 at Cox's Bazar and ITC companies, even though the speed remains low, the state-run submarine cable operator said.

Significant amount of unused bandwidth from the cut SEA-ME-WE 5 cable is being shifted to the first cable, it added.

""We are serving all our users with the help of other sources of bandwidth—the international terrestrial cable (ITC) and the first submarine cable,"" said Nazmul Karim Bhuiyan, secretary general of the ISP Association of Bangladesh.

However, users are facing some lag, he told TBS on Saturday afternoon.

""As the main broadband usage peaks during the night, we could learn about the full extent of the disruption and any resulting delays tonight,"" he added.

In a statement today (20 April), the submarine cable authorities expressed sincere apologies for the temporary inconvenience to its customers and assured of quick restoration of the second cable.

Bangladesh currently needs some 5,200 GBPS internet bandwidth and half of the demand is being catered by the ITC companies which import bandwidth from India.

After extensive fault-finding work, Basslink said the probable fault location was approximately 98 kilometres from the Tasmanian coast.

The Île de Ré cable repair ship will now cut the combined power and data cables, recover the ends to the ship, and test and cap them to prevent water from entering.

Basslink said the cut and cap process, subject to weather conditions in the Bass Strait, should take around two weeks. Cutting the cable will also sever the optical fibre link running along the interconnector, making Tasmania reliant on just two, older connections operated by incumbent Telstra.

Once the cut and cap operation is done, the Île de Ré will return to Geelong and load cable jointing equipment and personnel before the ship heads back to the cut location to insert new lengths at the point.

Locating the fault has turned out to be a lengthy and difficult task for Basslink's contractors Alcatel-Lucent.

So far, it's taken more than a month of round the clock work to find the fault, with experts conducting over 20 remotely operated vehicle missions that have collected in excess of 500 hours of pictures and other data.

As of yet, there is no indication as to what caused the fault. There is no visible damage to the cable, Basslink said, saying further cutting may be needed.

Cable operator Basslink is still searching for a fault on its cable connecting Tasmania with mainland Australia that was first identified last month, but expects it to be repaired on schedule by mid-March.

A fault affecting the high voltage direct current electricity interconnector on the 295 kilometre cable occurred on December 20 last year. It is estimated to be approximately 100 kilometres off Tasmania in the Bass Strait.

Basslink chief executive Malcolm Eccles said the first inspection of the cable using a remotely operated submarine did not reveal where the fault was.

The Alcatel-Lucent-operated cable vessel Ile de Ré has now been dispatched from Auckland with an 80-tonne cable reel frame fitted to its deck to locate the fault.

The ship is currently in the Bass Strait, with 60 people onboard including 13 cable joiners from Italy to find the fault, which is expected to take another four to five days.

One of two remotely controlled submarines will be used to cut the cable so it can be lifted up for repairs - the cable itself weighs 60 kilograms per metre and ""lifting this weight at sea poses a range of challenges,"" Basslink said.

Cutting the cable will take the fibre optic telecommunications cable out of service until the entire circuit has been repaired, Eccles said.

Basslink expects the cable to be cut and the fault analysed in early February. Repairs are still expected to be completed, putting Basslink back in service, by March 19, Eccles said.

He said telcos and internet providers on Basslink ""have contingencies in place, or are in the process of finalising these contingencies,"" but did not specify what these were.

Telstra operates two cables between Tasmania and the mainland, Bass Strait 1 and 2, which became operational in 1995 and 2003.

Cable Ship Lodbrog found the northern end of Tonga's damaged fibre optic cable yesterday, 11 August, and is currently attempting to locate the southern end attached to Tongatapu. The repair of the submarine domestic telecommunications cable is hoped to be completed this Friday, 16 August.  
  
Tonga's domestic cable was found to be completely cut at a point 96 km north of Tongatapu, believed to be the aftermath of an earthquake on 29 June. The cable connects Tongatapu with the Ha’apai and Vava’u groups.  
  
Tonga Cable Semisi Panuve told Matangi Tonga today, the damaged cable end towards the north was found around midday yesterday, 11 August.  
  
This was after searching on three attempts. The retrieved cable has been successfully tested towards Ha’apai and Vava’u and the cable has been capped off and was dropped back into the water with a buoy marker around 11:00pm last night,"" he said.

"Cuba Activates ALBA-1 Submarine Cable for Internet Connectivity","ALBA-1 cable reduces reliance on satellite services, enhancing Cuba's internet access since 2013.","https://www.dailydot.com/news/cuba-connects-internet-rensys","2013-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","Curt Hopkins",Yes,"Curt Hopkins","Austin, Texas, United States","141800","2013-01-21","English","The Daily Dot","**Cuba connects to the Internet (yes, in 2013)**

Yesterday, Rensys, an Internet intelligence company, announced that Cuba had connected to the Internet.

In early 2011, the 640-gigabyte ALBA-1 cable landed at the eastern Cuban town of Siboney from the Venezuelan port of La Guaira.

“In the two years since,” Doug Madory wrote on the Rensys blog, “the fate of the cable has been a mystery for Cuba observers. In the past week, our global monitoring system has picked up indications that this cable has finally been activated, although in a rather curious way, as we explain below.”

Cuba, now run ostensibly by Fidel Castro’s brother, Raúl, has long been an ally of oil-rich Venezuela, run by ailing populist Hugo Chávez, who has had a number of operations in Cuba for his cancer.

The submarine cable was supposed to end Cuba’s reliance on three foreign satellite services for its connection to the Internet, which is restricted largely to government offices and hard currency hotels for foreigners.

Rensys noticed last Monday that Spanish telecom giant Telefonica began service to Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba S.A. (ETECSA), the state telecom of Cuba. There is evidence, however, that the satellite services are still being used in conjunction with the submarine cable, indicating that the delays and problems with firing up the Cuban Internet have not been thoroughly eliminated.

Cuba under Raúl Castro has seen some loosening of controls against Cuban citizens, including legalizing the personal sale of homes and cars and a promise of free movement that sent Cubans running for long passport lines last week.

“We believe it is likely that Telefonica’s service to ETECSA is, either by design or misconfiguration, using its new cable asymmetrically (i.e., for traffic in only one direction),” said Madory. “In such a configuration, ETECSA enjoys greater bandwidth and lower latencies (along the submarine cable) when receiving Internet traffic but continues to use satellite services for sending traffic.”

Cuba continues to have one of the most restrictive Internet regimes in the world, rivaling North Korea. The lack of access is a detriment to, among other things, students studying engineering and related topics. A country famous for its medical competency could surely flourish in other areas should a path to open inquiry finally be established.

“Like a voracious Saturn devouring his children, the principal leaders of the revolution have not allowed any favored sons to overshadow them,” prominent Cuban blogger Yoanni Sanchez wrote recently in Foreign Policy.

Until his son feeds him a stone, things are likely to remain much the same.

**Update:** Monday, Rensys announced that Cuba seems to have switched over fully to cable for its outgoing Internet traffic, producing a profile consistent with “the traditional Internet that nearly everyone else on earth enjoys.” Reports from Havana indicated that “delays for Internet traffic were dropping perceptibly, as the new routing policy kicked in… We speculate that Cuban network operators changed their routing policy to make the ALBA-1 cable the default path for all outbound traffic from certain Cuban networks.”","The article discusses the activation of the ALBA-1 submarine cable in Cuba and its implications for internet connectivity.

It mentions the cable's role in reducing reliance on satellite services and provides context about its operational status.

ISLAMABAD/KARACHI: A fault in the India-Middle East-Western Europe (IMEWE) submarine cable caused consumers and businesses across Pakistan major internet disruptions, the Pakistan Tele­communication Authority (PTA) said on Saturday, adding that customers may experience slow browsing speed.

However, many people complained that they had no internet service at all.

“The Pakistan Telecom­munication Company Limi­ted (PTCL) has set up alternate routes to get the internet back up. The international team is dealing with the IMEWE and it will take a few days to sort out,” said PTCL spokesperson Imran Janjua.

“At the moment, there are two submarine cables which are down — there was a similar issue in July this year and it is still being repaired,” he added.

PTA says traffic being rerouted through alternative routes; tech industry at a virtual standstill.

The PTA and PTCL did not confirm how long it would take to restore internet services in the country.

The IMEWE submarine cable is an ultra-high capacity fibre optic undersea cable system which links India and Europe via the Middle East. The 12,091km-long cable has nine terminal stations, operated by leading telecom carriers from eight countries.

“One of the PTCL cables has been cut near Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Currently, internet services are affected. However, PTCL is in process [of shifting] its traffic on alternate routes/cables and services will be better soon,” said PTA spokesperson Khurram Mehran.

Khalid Bajwa of Patari, the country’s largest Pakis­tani music streaming platform, said that they had content scheduled to go up on social media on Saturday.

“Everything has stopped. There were a couple of videos which had to go to a brand for approval but nothing has happened. We upload around three to four videos everyday and have been trying to do so since morning but no luck,” he told Dawn.

WonderTree, a start-up run by Mohammad Waqas, also faced similar issues.

“We are a technology start-up and we have not been able to do anything from morning to evening,” he said.

“We had a lot of deadlines for Saturday, as it is the weekend and we needed to wind up a lot of things. Online banking was not available either, so we could not make payments. We just weren’t able to function,” he added.

Akash Sheikh of Nest IO — a technology incubator — said: “It is of great concern that our internet connectivity nationwide has been affected. A strong internet link is essential for productivity and critical to our infrastructure.”

Naseer Akhtar, chairman of the Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA), explained that such accidents happened all over the world, but stressed the necessity to invest in alternative routes for internet traffic, so businesses and people don’t suffer. “We’re lucky it happened over the weekend and not during a busy week,” he said.

According to Mustafa Butt, an information technology entrepreneur, activities came to a halt at work throughout the day. “Luckily it is a holiday and there is not much of a work load,” he added.

Mohammad Faisal, another IT entrepreneur, said that his entire day had been wasted. “Whatever little progress could be made was through mobile data. Most companies in the IT sector cannot afford the slightest disruption in internet service,” said the entrepreneur.

The outage also impacted mobile networks and internet service providers. Although Nayatel messaged its subscribers that its links would up by evening, browsing remained slow. PTCL subscribers struggled with browsing till late Saturday evening.

Wi-Tribe sent a message out to its customers explaining that “you might experience slow speed issue today due to a severe bandwidth degradation affecting all the internet service providers in Pakistan.”

Internet services were also disrupted in July, when a similar fault with one of the PTCL submarine cables created an outage. It took several hours before the internet traffic — both incoming and outgoing — were routed through an alternative cable.","The article titled 'Undersea cable fault strangles internet services' discusses a significant fault in the IMEWE submarine cable, which has led to major internet disruptions in Pakistan.

SAT-3/WASC/SAFE or South Atlantic 3/West Africa Submarine Cable is the longest submarine communications cable in the world with 17 landing points linking Portugal and Europe to South Africa, with connections to several West African countries along the route. It forms part of the SAT-3/WASC/SAFE cable system, where the SAFE cable links South Africa to Asia.

The SAT-3/WASC/SAFE system provides a path between Europe and Asia for telecommunications traffic that is an alternative to the cable routes that pass through the Middle East.

The Chief Executive Officer of ntel, Kamar Abass, said SAT-3 provided access to global markets and enabled “seamless and diverse” connectivity to the rest of the world.

He said, “The repair of SAT-3 is fantastic news for data-hungry consumers and corporate in need of superfast and abundant broadband carried over a robust fibre network with significant capacity and low latency.

“SAT-3’s 17 landing points and intermediate branches in-country and abroad provide for connections all the way to the FarEast, thanks to our alliance with SAFE.”

According to Abass, potential customers of SAT-3 include Nigeria’s Global System for Mobile communication and LTE operators, Internet Service Providers, major international companies, Private Telecom Operators, Content/Hosting Operators, Infomedics/Infomatics Operators, the judiciary (for the execution of real-time on-line matters), banks and the military as well as airline operators.

“SAT-3’s repair also included the cable’s physical diversion away from shipping lanes in the approach to the Port of Lagos. In the past, the dropping (and dragging) of anchors by such traffic had been associated with disruptions to the cable.

“With the repaired system’s activation, the system’s Upgrade IV will also be implemented. This boosts its throughput capacity from 420Gbps to 920Gbps in the northern segments and from 340Gbps to 800Gbps in the southern segments,” the ntel CEO said.

“SAT-3 Nigeria is now positioned to better address Nigeria’s need for super-fast internet connectivity, data-hungry applications, high-quality video-on-demand and increasing social media usage, thus enhancing customer experience.

“Today, submarine cable systems carry more than 98 per cent of all overseas voice, data and video traffic,” he said.

“The return of SAT-3 is significant in many respects. First launched in 2001, it was the precursor for Internet access between Europe and West Africa and it took off where SAT-2 left off as it reached full capacity.

“SAT-2 was brought into service in the early 1990s as a replacement for the original undersea cable SAT-1 that was constructed in the 1960s.”","The article discusses the SAT-3 submarine cable, focusing on its repair and significance for telecommunications.

For more than five years, Cuba has debated about the little cable,"" mentions Adrián Jesús Pérez, who adds: 'The computer scientist speaks, but so does the doctor, the baker, and the self-employed person with a family member on an internationalist mission, or simply emigrated to another country. One always wants to know about family, and this news makes one dream of more communication facilities.

In May 2012, more than a year after the cable's arrival in Cuba, Venezuelan Minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation, Jorge Arreaza, declared that the cable was operational and also improved connectivity in Venezuela. However, improvements in connection speed or increased access to the network have not been perceived from the island. In a November 2012 article, blogger Luis Toledo Sande recalls the stereotypes that ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) have suffered in the country and emphasizes the lack of information regarding internet access: 'Jumping like a hare, or peeking like a mole, the ghost of the demonization of technology recalls a certain case, not remote, where —according to witnesses— a high-ranking official said that the researchers of a center being analyzed were ideologically so poorly off or so suspicious that they wanted to have computers even in their homes. It is not for nothing that suspicions arose when, on days when the installation of a fiber optic cable to improve computing in the country was discussed, some voices rushed to warn that we should not get our hopes up, because the cable would not have sufficient capacity to guarantee the internet services in the desired magnitudes.

For a moment I thought, if all those who are immersed in the fierce battle to minimize imports think this way, now we will never have the Internet. Could it be that the Internet died the same day the fiber optic cable arrived on Cuban shores?'

Even Yasel Toledo, from his blog Mira Joven, emphasizes the inevitability of including the fiber optic cable among current topics of conversation.

A spokesperson from PTCL said that a major flaw in IMEWE had occurred near Saudi Arabia, while another official said the fault has disrupted the country's entire internet infrastructure.

The PTCL spokesperson also said that Jeddah has started making efforts to repair the cable, but added that ""restoring the network will take some time.""

""In its absence, PTCL is working towards an alternative network to provide users reliable internet,"" PTCL's Chief Business Development Officer Sikandar Naqvi told _DawnNews_.

According to _ProPakistani_, two other submarine cables, SEAMEWE 4 and TW1, have been offline since last month due to similar flaws, which has resulted in a bottleneck after IMEWE's breakdown.

The loss of these three submarine cables leaves Pakistan relying on SEMEWE 3, SEAMEWE 5 and the AAE1 submarine cables, out of which SEAMEWE3 operates in a limited capacity, while the other two were installed only recently, _ProPakistani_ said.

**Fallback system**

The 25,000-kilometre-long Asia-Africa-Europe-1 (AAE-1) submarine internet cable was brought online on July 2. It will now be put to the test as the bulk of the country's network load will fall on it until the IMEWE cable is usable again.

Along with Pakistan, the AAE-1 cable system connects Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, India, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Greece, Italy and France. It is the world's largest submarine cable system built in more than a decade.

It can provide the lowest latency express internet route among dozens of countries and regions across Asia and Europe, China Unicom, a key stakeholder in the project, had said in a statement when it was operationalised.","The article discusses the IMEWE submarine cable going offline and its significant impact on internet connectivity in Pakistan.

According to the ITU's ""Facts and Figures 2023"" report, 37% of the African population had internet access in 2023. Although this represents a slight decrease from the previous year's 40%, analysis by the Ecofin Agency indicates a consistent upward trend over the last decade.

From a modest 16% in 2013, internet usage in Africa climbed to 25% by 2016 and continued to grow steadily to reach 40% in 2022. Before the 2023 dip, the only other decline over the past ten years occurred in 2017, when usage dropped by 3.3 percentage points.

Several factors contributed to the surge between 2020 and 2022, notably the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced many activities online, thus increasing internet usage.

While the ITU does not provide specific reasons for the decrease between 2022 and 2023, several factors could be responsible, including the resumption of physical activities, internet blackouts in certain countries, and access issues elsewhere. In August 2023, disruptions in internet service in some African countries were attributed to the cutting of the WACS and SAT-3 submarine cables.

**Bridging the gap to global averages**

The 2023 data from the ITU indicates significant room for progress in Africa. While the continent reported a 37% internet usage rate, the global average stood at 67%. Meanwhile, Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and the Americas recorded internet usage rates between 87 and 91%. The Arab States and the Asia-Pacific region are closer to the global average, with rates of 69 and 66%, respectively.

Enhanced connectivity could significantly boost various economic sectors. An increase in the African online population could revolutionize sectors such as e-commerce. According to TechCabal Insights' ""Future of Commerce: Outlook for 2024"" report, the e-commerce sector is booming, with total revenue reaching $32.49 billion in 2022 and 387.5 million African online shoppers.

Despite having 25 submarine cables and 1.2 million km of terrestrial fiber, Africa's optical fiber footprint remains limited. Many countries still lack the necessary high-speed telecommunications infrastructure. Furthermore, Africa has the highest fixed broadband access rates in the world, costing an average of 14.8% of Gross National Income (GNI), far above the ITU's recommended 2%.

To enhance internet access in Africa, the Internet Society has made several recommendations. These include reforming the telecom market to encourage the emergence of competing access networks and expanding national basic infrastructures beyond major submarine cable landing points and primary population centers to additional population hubs.","The article discusses the rise of internet connectivity in Africa and mentions disruptions caused by the cutting of submarine cables, specifically the WACS and SAT-3 cables.

This mention is significant as it directly relates to the impact on internet service in various countries.

Although the primary focus of the article is on internet usage trends, the reference to cut submarine cables and their implications for connectivity indicates that the topic is addressed in a meaningful way.

For the past seven years, Marshallese people have accessed the internet through a super-speed cable that mostly carries US military traffic.

But now it needs repairs and a planned 10-day outage — that was due to finish at the weekend — has been extended without any definite end date because finding the source of the problem has proven difficult.

""I've been told that locating the repair site is like finding a pin head in a three-mile stretch of cable,"" the head of the National Telecommunications Authority, Tommy Kijiner Jr, said.

To make sure the country is not entirely cut off, authorities have reverted to satellite backup, which is providing just 3 per cent of the bandwidth Marshallese are used to.

Access to all websites, including all social media, has been blocked off and the limited bandwidth is being used for email traffic and some business and government customers, on a rotating basis.

It means people have been forced to give up social media use ""cold turkey"".

President Hilda Heine told parliament many Marshallese were suffering internet withdrawal symptoms.

In her state of the nation address last week, President Dr Hilda Heine told parliament many Marshallese were suffering internet withdrawal symptoms.

""Our customers are no longer used to the limited bandwidth that our satellite offers — going down from 1,500 megabits per second to a total of 50 for the entire country is a bit revolutionary in itself,"" Mr Kijiner said.

""One of the things that our IT team has been trying to do while rotating the limited bandwidth that we're using is making sure that people do not go to their Facebook sites but that has been very difficult.  

""I guess it is human nature that people just want to check up on what's going on with their Facebook sites but it's been tough — people just cannot do without the speed and reliability the fibre optic cable affords them. It changes everything.""

Mr Kijiner said that since the cable was laid in 2009, there had been debate about whether it was too expensive for a small country.

""I think for the first time our customers now appreciate what the fibre means — now businesses are saying we really need to have this,"" Mr Kijiner said.

One concern was that there would not be enough bandwidth for the Finance Ministry to process the Government payroll but after all other business customers were cleared from satellite access, the funds went through.

""I've got a 24/7 IT team working around the clock, making sure that those businesses that need to conduct whatever it is that they're doing, are able to do so,"" Mr Kijiner said.

""People here are quite patient — Marshallese by nature are very patient — and so when we tell them that you'll have to reschedule your transaction while we do this one, most people have been really cooperative and we're very thankful for that.""","The article discusses the impact of an internet blackout in the Marshall Islands caused by the need for repairs on an international underwater fiber optic cable.

Published on: 05 Jan 2025, 12:30 am  

A Finnish court has denied a request for the release of an oil tanker suspected by police of damaging an undersea power line and four telecommunications cables in the Baltic Sea last week.  

The incident was one of several since 2022 in which underwater critical infrastructure in the Baltic Sea has suffered suspicious damage. Baltic Sea nations are on high alert and NATO has said it will boost its presence in the Baltic Sea.  

**December 2024: Power and internet cables**  
The Estlink 2 undersea power cable connecting Finland and Estonia was damaged on December 25 along with four telecoms lines.  

Finland launched a sabotage investigation and on December 26 seized a tanker carrying Russian oil on suspicion it caused the damage by dragging its anchor.  

Finnish authorities said the Cook Islands-registered _Eagle S_ was part of a ""shadow fleet"" used to circumvent sanctions on Russian oil exports. The European Union condemned any deliberate destruction of Europe's infrastructure.  

Finnish police said on December 29 they had found tracks on the seabed where they suspect the _Eagle S_ of damaging the cables.  

**November 2024: Baltic telecom cables**  
Two undersea fibre-optic communications cables were severed on November 17 and 18, raising suspicions of sabotage.  

A 218-kilometre internet link between Lithuania and Sweden's Gotland island went out of service on November 17, while a 1,200-kilometre cable connecting Helsinki to Rostock stopped working on November 18.  

Investigators focused on the Chinese bulk carrier _Yi Peng 3_, which was linked to the timing and location of the breaches.  

**October 2023: Balticconnector gas pipe and cables**  
A subsea gas pipeline, the Balticconnector, was severed by a Chinese container vessel dragging its anchor on October 8, 2023.  

Authorities have been unable to determine whether the damage was accidental or deliberate.  

**September 2022: Nord Stream Blasts**  
Nord Stream 1 and 2 were damaged on September 26, 2022, by several subsea blasts, confirmed as a deliberate act.  

Investigations found traces of explosives, but no suspects were named.

The Asia Pacific Gateway (APG) undersea cable, which connects Vietnam with many countries in the region, is facing problems again from 26/7, noting that there had been no information about the repair work from the operator so far.

These incidents have immensely affected Internet use experiences of the Vietnamese lately like considerably slow speed, congestions, and even the inability to access websites with foreign servers.

Vietnam’s undersea internet cables break around 10 times a year on average, with each lasting for about a month.

The APG cable, officially launched in December 2016, is capable of providing bandwidths of up to 54 Tbps (Terabit per second). It runs 10,400 kilometers (6,460 miles) under the Pacific Ocean, linking Japan with Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.

#### Sometimes undersea internet cable attacked by sharks?

Sharks sometimes mistake undersea cables for prey and chew through them. In the search for new subsea oil fields, geologists use large vessels to tow several heavy-duty cables (called streamer cables) to collect seismic data. Equipped with hydrophones that receive the returned signals initiated from a seismic source, these streamer cables are deployed at about 16 – 65 feet (5–20 meters) deep, and each streamer is typically 26,247 ft (8 km) long. As one can imagine, this activity probably attracts numerous animals to check out what the ruckus is all about. One of these animals are sharks, who are attracted to the magnetic streamer fields and tend to bite through the cables! In some areas of the world, equipment loss due to shark attacks on streamer cables is a serious problem in terms of time delays and economic loss for the operator.

This isn’t the first time sharks have caused a headache for undersea cable systems. According to Network World, even Google has had to wrap their internet cables in Kevlar-like material to prevent damaging shark bites. So why are sharks attracted to undersea data cables? It’s not exactly known. Some believe that because sharks can sense electromagnetic fields through jelly-filled pores on their snouts called ampullae of Lorenzini, perhaps they are attracted by this electrical current and confusing it for food. Alternatively, shark expert Dr. Chris Lowe from California State University suggested they may just be curious about them. 

So what sharks are being naughty and making trouble? Multiple species, depending how deep the cables are at. But at this depth? One culprit may be bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) with their stout, grey bodies and short blunt snouts. A widely distributed shark in tropical and warm temperate waters worldwide, they are common in areas where oil companies have encountered problems with sharks attacking the streamer cables. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed bull sharks as Near Threatened (NT) because their occurrences in estuarine and freshwater areas makes them vulnerable to human impacts.","The article discusses the APG undersea cable, detailing its breakdown and the resulting negative impact on internet connectivity in Vietnam.

Although an initial timeline for repair work was set at two to three days due to proximity of local cable ships and equipment, that’s now turned into a number of weeks.

Bangladesh Submarine Cables Company (BSCPLC)’s General Manager for operations and maintenance, Saidur Rahman, told local news stations ""administrative work there (in Indonesia) takes a little longer,"" and ""the authorities said the repair work could be completed in the third or fourth week of next month.""

Despite becoming something of a subsea hub in South East Asia, with over 60 cables connected to its shores, Indonesia still has protectionist regulation around the repairs of cables carried out in its waters.

The government’s preferential cabotage policy requires cable repairs to be performed by Indonesian-ships, manned with Indonesian crews.

Despite being located in a busy shipping region, with ample equipment vessels and crews nearby, delays to repairs have been seen before.

In 2022 the Sulawesi Maluku Papua Cable System (SMPCS) had to wait two months for a repair ship to start fixing it, as the vessel was carrying out works on another system, had to refuel and then travel to the cut on SMPCS.

While the SEA-ME-WE 5 cable is damaged, Bangladesh is relying on connectivity through its only other subsea system, SEA-ME-WE 4 and terrestrial fibre links, mostly imported through India.

Rahman said that SEA-ME-WE 4 would be able to make up the capacity lost on SEA-ME-WE 5, but the ""concerned company"" would need to pay for the additional bandwidth, which he said ""is still not decided.""

Who exactly Rahman is referring to is unclear.

While this inlet is a strategic location for global shipping, it also plays a vital role in global communications networks.

How important are the cables that lay on the bottom of the Red Sea?

Just look at the number of existing and planned cables near the Yemeni coast, where most attacks have been concentrated:

#### Existing and Planned Cables in the Southern Red Sea

Many Asian, East African, and Middle Eastern countries rely on Red Sea cables to access Europe.

> We estimate that over half of many countries’ interregional bandwidth is connected to Europe via Red Sea cables.

According to TeleGeography’s latest data, we estimate that over half of many countries’ interregional bandwidth is connected to Europe via Red Sea cables. More broadly, over 90% of all Europe-Asia capacity is carried by cables in the Red Sea.

#### Share of Selected Countries’ Interregional Bandwidth via the Red Sea, 2023

### Deployment Delays

As the demand for international bandwidth continues to rise rapidly around the world, network operators are responding with investment in a large number of new cables. This includes several new projects in the Red Sea.

Even before the recent spate of rebel attacks on commercial shipping vessels, the Yemeni civil war created permitting headaches. Cable laying vessels require permits to enter a country’s territorial waters. When two different entities claim the same swath of sea, the situation becomes complicated.

The massive 2Africa cable, which is largely laid, has yet to realize deployment of a large length of cable that would lie in Yemeni waters. Other cables planned to traverse the Red Sea in coming years include IEX, Africa-1, Raman, and SeaMeWe-6.

Ensuring that these cables can be deployed is vital to meeting future demand requirements for East Africa, the Middle East, and India.

### Repair Risk

With deployment of new Red Sea cables in question, the importance of existing cables is further increased. Routine maintenance and cable repairs are required to keep these cables up and running.

In November, Global Cloud Xchange was able to complete scheduled maintenance on the company’s FALCON cable in Yemeni waters. However, future repairs may prove difficult if cables are damaged in areas with high levels of rebel activity.

After all, even if a cable repair ship is permitted to enter the waters and recover the damaged cable, completing a delicate repair may be difficult. This often requires cable ships to stay in one area for days.

Were a stationary cable ship to be attacked in the midst of a repair, evasive maneuvers may not be possible. Cable ship operators may therefore decide that these repairs are not worth risking their vessels and crew.

### Avoiding the Red Sea?

What happens if damage occurs to Red Sea cables that cannot be immediately repaired? In most cases, data can continue to flow using alternative systems and routes.

Gulf countries could access Europe via terrestrial network links to Saudi Arabia. India has links eastward to Singapore. East African countries could divert traffic up the West Coast of the continent. But you cannot quickly and completely reroute all existing traffic along other paths.

Imagine the impact of rerouting traffic from a closed six-lane highway to a two-lane road. Network quality would suffer depending on the number and capacities of cables damaged.

Hopefully, the situation in this part of the world will stabilize in the near-term. Until then, risks will persist for existing and planned cables in the Red Sea.","The article discusses the importance of subsea cables in the Red Sea, detailing their role in global communications and the risks they face due to attacks by Yemeni Houthi rebels.

By Adi Robertson, a senior tech and policy editor focused on VR, online platforms, and free expression.  

Cuba seems to have started accepting internet traffic through an underwater cable, not just the slow and limited satellites it's relied on for years. Traffic monitoring company Renesys said yesterday that it had detected a new connection between Spanish ISP Telefonica and the state-owned Cuban telecommunications company, with lower latencies than would be possible through the aging satellite system — though overall speeds are still quite slow. That would be a first step towards real connectivity in a country with the worst internet in Latin America, even if it's still unlikely ordinary people would be able to get access.  

Like North Korea, Cuba limits most people to a local, more tightly controlled intranet. What's more, Renesys reports that this new connection is only operational in one direction: whether by design or mistake, traffic can come in via cable, but outgoing information must use the slower satellite system. The cable that's likely being used runs from Cuba to Venezuela; it was first announced in 2009 and meant to be operational around 2011, connecting Cuba to the larger underwater network.  

For years, though, its actual status has been a mystery. In mid-2012, the Miami Herald reported that it was operational but only being used for strategic government communications, while Reuters reported soon after that there was no evidence the cable was in use. Cuba has previously blamed its poor internet connectivity on the US embargo. Now, Renesys notes that it started noticing traffic on the cable the same day Cuba dropped its requirement for exit visas, saying it could be part of a general move towards greater openness. But as we've seen elsewhere, technological progress doesn't always lead to more political or social freedom in the short term.","The article discusses an underwater internet cable from Cuba to Venezuela and its operational limitations (only accepting incoming traffic), which relates to the broader topic of undersea cables.

Australian carriers that rely on the cable for inter-Asia connectivity reported that the repairs had been completed at 8.21am AEDT this morning.

This was about five days later than first anticipated, owing to the need to repair a series of faults on the cable rather than just the initial one discovered back on August 30.

The cable ship Asean Explorer spent the past few days making the final reconnections off the coast of Jakarta, Indonesia.

Australian internet traffic has also been affected over the same period by additional subsea cable breakages off the coast of Hong Kong in the wake of powerful typhoons that swept through the area.

ISPs including iiNet this morning revealed those links had been successfully repaired on September 30.

“The link has remained stable and we have now resumed direct peering traffic for Singapore, Hong Kong and other Asian destinations,” iiNet said.

The reconnection of the cables means that much Australian internet traffic into SE Asia will no longer have to be routed across the Pacific via the United States, reducing service latency.

New Delhi: Digital connectivity in India is set to get a major boost, with three large undersea cable projects — 2Africa Pearls, India-Asia-Express (IAX), and India-Europe-Express (IEX) — slated to go onstream between October and next March, expanding existing capacity by more than four times.  

2Africa, among the longest subsea cable systems in the world, spanning over 45,000 km, has investments from Bharti Airtel and Meta, among others. It will have a capacity of 180 terabits per second (tbps), connecting 33 countries, including Airtel’s landing station in Mumbai. IAX and IEX involve contributions from Reliance Jio, among others.  

IAX and IEX will be landing at Mumbai and Chennai, respectively, reinforcing India’s weight in the global telecom market. IEX will have a capacity of over 200 tbps, covering 9,775 km from Mumbai to the Persian Gulf and further to Europe. IAX will also have a capacity of more than 200 tbps, extending more than 16,000 kms, starting from Mumbai, and connecting Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Sri Lanka.  

Submarine cables are high-capacity optic fibre pairs laid on the ocean floor to provide global connectivity for high-speed data exchange. Experts said the three projects combined will significantly enhance capacity, besides improving the quality of internet services for applications such as 5G video streaming, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing.  

India had 17 international subsea cables landing in 14 distinct stations in five cities, with a cumulative lit capacity of 138.55 tbps and activated capacity of 111.11 tbps as of 2023.  

This March, 15 prominent subsea cables were damaged by Yemen-based Houthi rebels in the Red Sea, disrupting global internet. Instability in Yemen in the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war impeded immediate restoration efforts by operators.  

Subsea cables currently transmit more than 99% of the world’s internet traffic, underlining the importance of diversity in subsea cable routes and cable landing stations (CLS).  

With a user base of 1.2 billion, India has emerged as one of the world's largest telecom markets, with average per capita data consumption of 24.1 gigabytes (GB) per month, expected to reach around 28 GB a month by December-end.  

India’s strategic location in the Indo-Pacific region, along with its recent data centre developments, has poised the country to be a leader in the region for data hosting and data traffic flows.  

Emerging markets like India, with their booming data economy, have been part of this growth story. Telecom companies and hyperscalers made early investments in strengthening India’s connectivity with the rest of the world through large projects like IAX, IEX, and 2Africa, which will significantly boost India’s digital growth, including data centres, high-speed internet, and the broader digital infrastructure ecosystem.

"Tonga's Backup Satellite Services Amid Submarine Cable Repair","Local telecommunications rely on satellite links as the domestic submarine cable outage since June 29 disrupts services for Vava’u and Ha’apai islands.","https://islandsbusiness.com/news-break/tonga-communications","2024-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","Reporter IB",Yes,"Reporter IB","Suva, Fiji",-,"2024-07-08","English","Front Page Pte Limited","**Tonga’s local telephone and internet service providers, Tonga Telecommunications Corporation (TCC) and Digicel, are using satellite links to restore their services to the two outer islands groups, with hopes that the domestic submarine fibre optic cable might be fixed in the next few weeks.**  

Their Vava’u and Ha’apai telephone and internet services are surviving on low bandwidth backup satellite capacity, which at peak times has lower than normal capacity and quality.  

The two outer island groups north of Tongatapu have suffered poor telephone and internet services since June 29, when the inter-island domestic submarine cable went dark.  

The local network providers, TCC and Digicel, restored some of their services to Vava’u and Ha’apai using satellites.  

TCC CEO Sione Veikoso told Matangi Tonga that their service quality drops during peak times, but after peak hours the network operation was normal.  

“The mobile network has been fully restored with both voice and mobile internet. During peak times the service quality degrades and is not as good as when the fibre cable was still connected.”  

“As for fixed lines services, the landline voice has been fully restored,” he said.  

“In addition to this for fixed internet customers, we provide satellite VSAT terminals for some of the customers who wish to use this option both in Ha’apai and Vava’u,” he said.  

Meanwhile, Digicel CEO, Daniel Horan, said their services had been close to their normal capacity since last Friday, 02 August.  

“As with the submarine cable, when that was broken we added a satellite service to Vava’u to get it up and running in about half the bandwidth capacity of what we previously had. I’m very pleased to say that we’ve increased that so now, we’re back up to somewhat close to what we originally had, from a bandwidth perspective.”  

He said that customers in Vava’u could now get Digicel, 4G, 3G, and 2G.  

Ha’apai had already got their services operating because it’s a smaller market and was easier, whereas for Vava’u, it was 10-15 times bigger and more complex to fix.  

“So that has taken a little bit more time. But yes, it’s all back to normal from a customer’s perspective. You should be able to do all your normal video, YouTube, all of that sort of good stuff.”  

“From our perspective right now, which I think may be slightly different to some other companies, we’re more or less back to normal.”  

Daniel said they would run that service for as long as it takes until the submarine cable is fixed.  

“We’re hoping obviously that Tonga cable will be able to fix the submarine cable sometime in the next few weeks.”  

TCC CEO Sione Veikoso said the satellite backup capacity TCC is paying for is more expensive than what they paid for fibre services. Meanwhile, the cable repair ship CS Lodbrog had departed Fiji and was on its way to Tonga, and was expected to arrive Wednesday, Tonga Cable ACEO, Sosafate Kolo, said.","The article titled 'Vava’u and Ha’apai communications services survive on backup satellites as cable awaits repair' discusses the impact of a broken submarine cable on telecommunications in Tonga.

It mentions that the domestic submarine fibre optic cable went dark on June 29, resulting in poor telephone and internet services for the Vava’u and Ha’apai island groups.

The article highlights that local service providers are using satellite links as a temporary solution while awaiting repair of the submarine cable.

There is a popular expression in Cuba that is synonymous with difficulty and crisis. When you want to indicate that someone is doing badly economically, it is sufficient to say that he is “eating a cable.” Street humor has identified the act of chewing and swallowing a bundle of wires with scarcity and material want. The parable has gained strength these days in reference to the fiber-optic cable installed between Cuba and Venezuela, which has yet to provide service to Cuban clients despite reports that it is finally functioning.  

In 2007, Cuba and Venezuela began working on installation of the Alba-1 submarine cable, named for the Spanish acronym of the Bolivarian Alternative for the Countries of Our America. At the cost of $70 million and after a series of delays, the cable touched ground in Santiago de Cuba in February 2011. However, the island continued to use satellite providers for what little Internet service was available. In the two years since, government media has been silent about the cable, generating rumors of a possible failure due to mismanagement or the diversion of resources.  

Three weeks ago, an expert at Renesys, a U.S. firm that analyzes Internet traffic, suggested in his blog that the Alba-1 cable had started showing activity. At first, traffic was detectable in only one direction, but after several days he had confirmed the sending and receiving of data. Doug Madory, a Renesys research engineer, said the Spanish company Telefónica SA had begun to direct Internet traffic to the government-owned Internet service provider ETECSA. Telefónica denied it was supplying routing services for the Alba-1, but confirmed that it was providing other services to ETECSA.  

The expert said lower Internet latencies to Cuba could be evidence that the island is using other sources of access in addition to the satellites. “While activation of the Alba-1 could be a good way to improve ETECSA’s links to the Internet, Cuba will probably continue to be unable to provide a wide range of network access,” Madory wrote on Renesys’s website.  

According to official statistics, 23 of every 100 inhabitants on the island have access to the Internet. That figure has been heavily criticized and put in doubt by many analysts, who say that the rate includes users of the country’s intranet, where no websites are available that dissent from the regime. Studies have ranked Cuba in last place in Latin America for international Internet connectivity with a rate of only 3 percent, but even that number seems optimistic.  

In the two weeks since the first signs of cable activity, there has been no perceptible change in connectivity for users in work or educational centers. Nor, as far as can be proved, has the speed increased in the few Internet cafés that exist in Havana. With prices ranging between 5 and 10 euros (about US$7 to US$13) per hour, hotels continue to offer extremely slow connections to the Internet and many sites are blocked.  

The same day the Alba-1 activity was reported, a young man who was waiting outside a crowded Internet café in Old Havana was surprised by the information provided by Renesys. “Now how will they explain why we have to pay so much for an hour of connection?” he asked. The various people waiting their turn for a computer concurred.  

The independent journalist Frank Abel Garcia, whose tweets under the handle @FrankAbelCuba are published only via text messages, was skeptical about the news. “I think there is no interest or political will on the part of the government for the people to have Internet access.” In his estimation, if the cable was activated on a massive scale it could be a “strong blow to state propaganda. It would open the eyes of a lot of people in regards to what happens in the world and in our own country.”  

The official media, as usual, have been silent, and television programs continue to depict the Internet as a conglomerate of violence, pornography, and false information. But many young people seem excited and anxious about the latest details on the cable that have appeared in the international press. Perhaps the great World Wide Web is closer than it appears.  

Yoani Sánchez is a pioneer in the Cuban blogger community. Time magazine listed her as one of the world’s 100 most influential people in 2008. In 2009, she received a Maria Moors Cabot citation from Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism.","The article discusses the Alba-1 submarine cable, detailing its installation, challenges in providing service, and its implications for internet connectivity in Cuba.

**The snapped cables are causing internet disruptions in South Africa.**  
**But the Léon Thévenin is carrying out repairs near Kenya on the east coast of Africa – more than 8 000 kilometres away - before it heads to the Congo Canyon.**  

The only underwater cable-laying ship authorised to tackle the repair of undersea cables in the whole of sub-Saharan Africa is still more than 8 000 kilometres away from the site where two cables, critical to the provision of internet services in South Africa, snapped on the same day.

The Léon Thévenin is just off the coast of Kenya, on the east coast of Africa. The West Africa Cable System (WACS) and the South Atlantic Telecommunications Cable number three (SAT-3) snapped on the west coast of Africa, off the coast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

News24 had a look at the position of the ship on Marine Traffic, a maritime analytics provider, and saw that it was still located off the coast of Kenya, where it is involved in another marine repair.

The repair vessel will have to make the more than 8 000-kilometre journey around the southern tip of the continent.

The two underwater fibre-optic cables snapped on 6 August, allegedly due to a rockfall in the Congo Canyon.

Various companies in South Africa and along the west coast of the continent rely on the cables for internet services.

Since the cables play a crucial role in enabling the rapid transfer of information across long distances, internet disruptions have been experienced.

David Belson, the head of data insight at Cloudflare, one of the biggest networks operating on the internet, said websites hosted in the US or Europe may feel slow or not work at all in South Africa because of the break.

""This will make websites feel slower, or just not work at all. Networks are actively working on bringing up new capacity to deal with the cut, while work is under way to repair the break, which may take weeks to repair,"" Belson said.

**No alternatives**  
Jess Auerbach, an associate professor at the University of Cape Town's Graduate School of Business, who is in the process of writing a book about fibre-optic cables, said the Léon Thévenin was the only ship authorised to tend to the subsea cables of sub-Saharan Africa.

There are other ships for repairs to subsea cables, according to Auerbach, but there are legal arrangements and cost factors involved, which mean that they can't be used for the repairs on many African cable segments, including the portion of WACS and SAT-3 that are damaged.

Thus, the companies that rent capacity on WACS and SAT-3 will have to wait for the Léon Thévenin to finish its current job and travel to the Congo Canyon.

In the meantime, many companies have been able to reroute the traffic that would normally be serviced on the WACS and SAT-3 cables to other subsea cables.

**The repair**  
Auerbach explained that the process that will likely be followed to repair the cables once the ship has made the voyage to the DRC.

The Léon Thévenin has a remote-controlled submersible on board which will be deployed to retrieve the cable from the sea floor.

The subsea cables look a little bit like a garden hosepipe and contain many high-quality glass threads that can carry vast quantities of information very quickly over long distances. These threads are encased in other materials.

Once the cable is above water, there is a team of skilled technicians on board the vessel who will assess the work that needs to be done, and the damaged cable section will be repaired on the ship.

**Africa underserved**  
In recent months, Google and Meta have landed new subsea cables on South African shores that run along the west coast of the continent.

Auerbach said that the number of cables around the continent was increasing rapidly, which means that more breaks in the cables can be expected.

This means that the lack of repair infrastructure and maintenance skills may need to be reconsidered going forward, she added.

She said:  
At the moment I think it fair to say that Africa is radically underserved.  
""There is a lack of available infrastructure at the levels of repairs and maintenance,"" said Auerbach.  

She said that the lack of capacity to deal with cable breaks was driven by the lack of the repair ships themselves, a shortage of expertise and the legal structures that need to be in place to undertake repairs.  

The vessels are very expensive pieces of infrastructure, she said.

**Wait time**  
Vodacom spokesperson Byron Kennedy, said WACS and SAT-3 were expected to be repaired by 8 September, ""weather permitting"".

Until then, South Africans might experience some internet complication, especially during peak usage times.","The article titled ""Only one cable-laying ship can fix snapped underwater cables and it's still on the other side of Africa"" discusses the recent snapping of two undersea cables, the West Africa Cable System (WACS) and the South Atlantic Telecommunications Cable (SAT-3), which has caused significant internet disruptions in South Africa.

It mentions that these cables snapped on August 6, allegedly due to a rockfall in the Congo Canyon, and emphasizes the importance of these cables for internet connectivity.

The article details the logistical challenges of repairing these cables, noting that the only cable-laying ship authorized to make the repairs, the Léon Thévenin, is currently engaged in another repair operation over 8,000 kilometers away in Kenya.

This situation illustrates the critical role these undersea cables play in telecommunications and the direct impact of their damage on internet services.

Telstra is forced to warn the captains of between 30 and 50 container ships a month that are seen to be travelling too close to the telco’s subsea cable infrastructure paths.

Executive director of international operations and services Darrin Webb said in a blog post that the telco particularly had issues around Singapore and Hong Kong.

Both cities are major landing points for cables in the region, but are also two of Asia’s busiest “and shallowest” container ports, Webb said.

The telco has a dedicated team that uses a ship’s Automatic Identification System (AIS) – which provides an identification number, position, course and speed for each vessel – to determine where each is in relation to subsea cables in the area.

“If a ship gets too close, our team will make a call to the captain so they can adjust their course,” Webb said.

“On average, our team contacts 30 – 50 container ships a month.”

Webb said the telco also used other methods to protect its subsea infrastructure in the region.

These included employing “out of season fishing crews to monitor areas susceptible to regular damage”, thought to be caused by unregulated fishing boats.

He said Telstra had – in some areas – buried cables “up to three metres below the seabed to avoid being hit by anchors”, or had overland cable redundancy in disaster-prone areas, where the impact of earthquakes or typhoons might damage subsea infrastructure.

Submarine cable infrastructure is regularly damaged, though the causes aren't always clear. Last year, there were cuts to both PPC-1 and Basslink.

_Update, 2.08pm:_ Telstra's blog post initially stated that cables were buried up to three kilometres below the seabed. The blog post has since been updated to read metres.","The article discusses Telstra's subsea cable infrastructure and the risks associated with container ships and fishing activities.

There would be a ribbon-cutting ceremony, except you’d need scuba divers: One of the world’s most ambitious optical network connection projects is now officially complete, and beginning the process of opening itself up for business. Japan’s NTT Communications, representing a partnership of major telcos in nine Asian countries, announced this week the commencement of service over the Asia Pacific Gateway (APG), a 10,400-kilometer span of fiber optic cable.

NTT boasts a theoretical capacity for APG of 54 terabits per second — much higher than the partnership’s original goal of 40 Tbps. However, Greg’s Cable Map lists its operational capacity at 38.4 Tbps.

The news will have already sparked celebrations in Vietnam, whose Internet service has been plagued by service problems ever since the Asia America Gateway cable (AAG) was launched in November 2009. AAG has suffered from numerous ruptures, and efforts to repair it were indefinitely canceled last March, after repair crews reported they could not find the rupture point.

**Southeast Asia Gets a Boost**  

APG will link Da Nang with both Osaka and Tokyo. NTT will manage junctions to the existing PC-1 loop, a 640 Gbps cable connecting Grover Beach, California, and Harbor Pointe, Washington. Other municipalities being linked by APG include: Chongming, Nanhui District, and Tseung Kwan O in Hong Kong; Kuantan, Malaysia; Songhkla, Thailand; Tanah Merah, Singapore; Toucheng, Taiwan; and Busan, South Korea. Korea Telecom opened a major Submarine Network Operation Center in South Korea last June.

Since South Korea will host the 2018 Winter Olympics, KT is interested in delivering multiple channels of live, Ultra-HD resolution video, capable of reaching all points of the globe at 5G speeds.

Three years ago, the Southeast Asia-Japan Cable (SJC) became operational, with a theoretical capacity of 23 Tbps, linking Japan with several countries but skipping over Vietnam and South Korea.

**Where Facebook Goes, Conspiracy Follows**  

Facebook invested in the construction of APG in 2012. A regional tech publication speculated whether Facebook had specific designs on the Asian market. However, NTT will handle the junction between Osaka, Tokyo, and two points on the American West Coast. Facebook also teamed up with Microsoft to build a new submarine cable across the Pacific Ocean, dubbed MAREA, with an incredible capacity goal of 160 Tbps.

In summary, the APG project represents a significant advancement in submarine cable technology, enhancing internet connectivity across Asia and addressing previous service issues in Vietnam.","The article discusses submarine cables in detail, particularly the Asia Pacific Gateway (APG) and the Asia America Gateway (AAG).

"The Most Vulnerable Place on the Internet","Millions offline due to the AAE-1 cable cut in Egypt, causing widespread internet blackouts.","https://www.wired.com/story/submarine-internet-cables-egypt","2022-11-02T12:00:00.000Z","",Yes,"Matt Burgess","San Francisco, California, USA",-,"2022-11-02","English","WIRED","**The Most Vulnerable Place on the Internet**  
The Asia-Africa-Europe-1 internet cable travels 15,500 miles along the seafloor, connecting Hong Kong to Marseille, France. As it snakes through the South China Sea and toward Europe, the cable helps provide internet connections to more than a dozen countries, from India to Greece. When the cable was cut on June 7, millions of people were plunged offline and faced temporary internet blackouts.  

The cable, also known as AAE-1, was severed where it briefly passes across land through Egypt. One other cable was also damaged in the incident, with the cause of the damage unknown. However, the impact was immediate. “It affected about seven countries and a number of over-the-top services,” says Rosalind Thomas, the managing director of SAEx International Management, which plans to create a new undersea cable connecting Africa, Asia, and the US. “The worst was Ethiopia, that lost 90 percent of its connectivity, and Somalia thereafter also 85 percent.” Cloud services belonging to Google, Amazon, and Microsoft were all also disrupted, subsequent analysis revealed.  

While connectivity was restored in a few hours, the disruption highlights the fragility of the world’s 550-plus subsea internet cables, plus the outsized role Egypt and the nearby Red Sea have in the internet’s infrastructure. The global network of underwater cables forms a large part of the internet’s backbone, carrying the majority of data around the world and eventually linking up to the networks that power cell towers and Wi-Fi connections. Subsea cables connect New York to London and Australia to Los Angeles.  

Sixteen of these submarine cables—which are often no thicker than a hosepipe and are vulnerable to damage from ships’ anchors and earthquakes—pass 1,200 miles through the Red Sea before they hop over land in Egypt and get to the Mediterranean Sea, connecting Europe to Asia. The last two decades have seen the route emerge as one of the world’s largest internet chokepoints and, arguably, the internet’s most vulnerable place on Earth. (The region, which also includes the Suez Canal, is also a global choke point for shipping and the movement of goods. Chaos ensued when the container ship _Ever Given_ got wedged in the canal in 2021.)  

“Where there are chokepoints, there are single points of failure,” Nicole Starosielski, an associate professor of media, culture, and communication at New York University and an author on submarine cables. “Because it's a site of intense concentration of global movement, that does make it more vulnerable than many places around the world.”  

The area has also recently gained attention from the European Parliament, which in a June report highlighted it as a risk for widespread internet disruption. “The most vital bottleneck for the EU concerns the passage between the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean via the Red Sea because the core connectivity to Asia runs via this route,” the report says, flagging extremism and maritime terrorism are risks in the area.  

**Pyramid Scheme**  
Look at Egypt on a map of the world’s subsea internet cables and it immediately becomes clear why internet experts have been concerned about the area for years. The 16 cables in the area are concentrated through the Red Sea and touch land in Egypt, where they make a 100-mile journey across the country to reach the Mediterranean Sea. (Cable maps don’t show the exact locations of cables.)  

It has been estimated that around 17 percent of the world’s internet traffic travels along these cables and passes through Egypt. Alan Mauldin, the research director of telecoms market research firm TeleGeography, says last year the region had 178 terabits of capacity, or 178,000,000 Mbps—the US has median home internet speeds of 167 Mbps.  

Egypt has become one of the internet’s most prominent chokepoints for a few reasons, says Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at monitoring firm Kentik. Primarily, its geography contributes to the concentration of cables in the area. Passing through the Red Sea and across Egypt is the shortest (mostly) underwater route between Asia and Europe. While some intercontinental internet cables travel across land, it is generally safer for them to be placed at the bottom of the sea where it is harder for them to be disrupted or snooped upon.","The article titled ""The Most Vulnerable Place on the Internet"" discusses the cutting of the AAE-1 submarine internet cable in Egypt, which directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables.

The service disruption caused by Thursday’s cuts to the undersea cable supplying broadband Internet connectivity to Nigeria and countries in the West African sub-region forced many banks and telecom companies to scale down their operations. Customers were left frustrated as they could not carry out major transactions.  

Telecom engineers were dispatched to fix the fibre optic cables between Senegal and Cote D’Ivoire. The National Communications Authority in Ghana reported that the outage was caused by multiple undersea cable disruptions affecting mobile and fixed data services nationwide.  

The Nigerian Communications Commission confirmed that the cuts disrupted data and voice services along the African West Coast, affecting several West African countries.  

MainOne, a key Internet provider for Nigerian banks, suffered significant outages, preventing access to banking apps and USSD services. Bank officials reported huge financial losses due to the disruptions.  

Customers continued to encounter difficulties accessing essential services, leading to frustrations as many transactions were affected. Some managed to regain access through fintech apps, highlighting the need for backup plans in banking operations.

Cables belonging to four major telecoms networks have been “cut” causing “significant” disruption to communications networks in the Middle East, according to Hong Kong telecoms company HGC Global Communications.

HGC estimates that 25% of traffic between Asia and Europe as well the Middle East has been impacted, it said in a statement Monday.

The company said it is rerouting traffic to minimize disruption for customers and also “extending assistance to affected businesses.”

HGC did not say how the cables had been damaged or who was responsible.

South Africa-based Seacom, which owns one of the cable systems affected, told CNN that repairs wouldn’t begin for at least another month, partly because of the length of time it takes to secure permits to operate in the area.

Underwater cables are the invisible force driving the internet, with many funded in recent years by internet giants such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook parent Meta. Damage to these subsea networks can cause widespread internet outages, as happened following the Taiwan earthquake in 2006.

The destruction of cables in the Red Sea comes weeks after the official Yemeni government warned of the possibility that Houthi rebels would target the cables. The Iranian-backed militants have already disrupted global supply chains by attacking commercial vessels in the crucial waterway.

Reports last week from Israeli news outlet Globes suggested the Houthis had been behind the damage to the cables.

Yemeni rebel leader Abdel Malek al-Houthi denied the allegations. “We have no intention of targeting sea cables providing internet to countries in the region,” he said.

The Houthis have since blamed British and US military units operating in the area for the damage, according to a report Saturday by the rebels’ official news agency. CNN has contacted the UK and US governments for comment.

Seacom’s chief digital officer Prenesh Padayachee said acquiring permits from the Yemeni maritime authority to repair the cables could take up to eight weeks. “Client traffic will continue to be rerouted until we are able to repair the damaged cable,” he added.

Among the other networks affected is Asia-Africa-Europe 1, a 25,000-kilometer (15,534-mile) cable system connecting South East Asia to Europe via Egypt. The Europe India Gateway (EIG) has also been damaged.

EIG connects Europe, the Middle East and India and counts Vodafone as a major investor. Vodafone, a large mobile network operator in the United Kingdom, declined to comment.

The company says on its website that it can send internet traffic across some 80 submarine cable systems that reach 100 countries.

Most large telecoms companies rely on multiple undersea cable systems, allowing them to reroute traffic in the event of an outage to ensure uninterrupted service.","The article titled ""Red Sea cables have been damaged, disrupting internet traffic"" provides a detailed account of damage to submarine cables in the Red Sea, which is a direct reference to the topic of cut sea cables.

Three cables under the Red Sea that provide global internet and telecommunications have been cut as the waterway remains a target of Yemen’s Houthi rebels, officials said Monday. Meanwhile, a Houthi missile attack set a ship ablaze in the Gulf of Aden, but caused no injuries.

What cut the lines remains unclear. There has been concern about the cables being targeted in the Houthi campaign, which the rebels describe as an effort to pressure Israel to end its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The Houthis have denied attacking the lines, however.

While global shipping has already been disrupted through the Red Sea, a crucial route for cargo and energy shipments from Asia and the Middle East to Europe, the sabotage of telecommunication lines could further escalate the monthslong crisis.

The cut lines include Asia-Africa-Europe 1, the Europe India Gateway, Seacom and TGN-Gulf, Hong Kong-based HGC Global Communications said. It described the cuts as affecting 25 per cent of the traffic flowing through the Red Sea. It described the Red Sea route as crucial for data moving from Asia to Europe and said it had begun rerouting traffic.

HGC Global Communications described the Seacom-TGN-Gulf line as being two separate cables when it is actually one at the area of the cut, according to Tim Stronge, a subsea cable expert with TeleGeography, a Washington-based telecommunications market research company.

Responding to questions from The Associated Press, Seacom said that “initial testing indicates the affected segment lies within Yemeni maritime jurisdictions in the Southern Red Sea.” It said it was rerouting the traffic that it was able to change, though some services were down.

Tata Communications, part of the Indian conglomerate and behind the Seacom-TGN-Gulf line, told AP that it “initiated immediate and appropriate remedial actions” after the line was cut.

“We invest in various cable consortiums to increase our diversity and hence in such situations of a cable cut or snag, we are able to automatically reroute our services,” Tata said.

Other firms behind those lines, which provide data to Africa, Asia and the Middle East, didn't respond to AP's queries.

In early February, Yemen's internationally recognized government in exile alleged that the Houthis planned to attack the cables. The lines appeared to have been cut on Feb. 24, with the organization NetBlocks noticing internet access in the East African nation of Djibouti suffering from interruptions two days later. Seacom serves Djibouti.

But for their part, the Houthis have denied targeting the cables. The rebels blamed the disruptions on British and U.S. military operations, but didn't offer evidence to support the allegation and have made false claims in the past.

Since November, the rebels have repeatedly targeted ships in the Red Sea and surrounding waters over the Israel-Hamas war. Those vessels have included at least one with cargo bound for Iran, the Houthis’ main benefactor, and an aid ship later bound for Houthi-controlled territory.

Despite more than a month and a half of U.S.-led airstrikes, Houthi rebels have remained capable of launching significant attacks. They include the attack last month on a cargo ship carrying fertilizer, the Rubymar, which sank on Saturday after drifting for several days, and the downing of an American drone worth tens of millions of dollars.

The Houthis insist their attacks will continue until Israel stops its combat operations in the Gaza Strip, which have enraged the wider Arab world and seen the Houthis gain international recognition.

Meanwhile, the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center on Monday separately warned of a new attack in the Gulf of Aden. The private security firm Ambrey described the vessel targeted as a Liberia-flagged, Israel-affiliated container ship that sustained damage and issued a distress call.

“The container ship reportedly encountered two explosions of which the first occurred at a ‘distance’ off its port quarter, while the second damaged the vessel’s accommodation block and a container leading,” Ambrey said. “The explosion further led to a fire onboard and the crew’s firefighting efforts were underway.”

Ambrey and the UKMTO said no crew member on the ship had been injured in the blaze, which was extinguished several hours later.

Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesman, claimed the attack in a prerecorded statement. He identified the ship as the MSC Sky II, sailing for the Switzerland-based firm Mediterranean Shipping Co, but sought to link the vessel to Israel. The ship's details and last-known location corresponded to details about the attack.

The Houthis “will continue to prevent Israeli navigation or those heading to the ports of occupied Palestine until the aggression is stopped and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted,” Saree said.

The U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, which patrols the Middle East, and MSC didn't respond to questions about the attack.

It remains unclear how the Houthis could attack subsea cables themselves. The rebels aren't known to have the diving or salvage capability to target the lines, which sit hundreds of meters below the surface of the waterway.

However, subsea cables can be cut by anchors, including those dropped from some of the ships that have been disabled in attacks. A drifting ship with its anchor scraping the sea could be the culprit.

“Our team thinks it is plausible that it could have been affected by anchor dragging, due to the amount of marine traffic the region deals with and the low seabed in many parts of the Red Sea,” Seacom said. “This can only be confirmed once the repair ship is on site.”

There are 14 cables now running through the Red Sea, with another six planned, said Stronge, the subsea cable expert.

“We estimate that over 90% of communications between Europe and Asia traverse submarine cables in the Red Sea,” he said. “Fortunately, telecom operators have built a high degree of redundancy into the system — there are many cables traversing the Red Sea.”

The Houthis later warned any cable-laying ship entering Yemeni waters needed a permit from the rebels “out of concern for its safety.”","The article titled ""Three Red Sea data cables cut as Houthis launch more attacks in the vital waterway"" provides a thorough discussion on the cutting of undersea cables in the Red Sea.

It mentions that three cables, including the Asia-Africa-Europe 1 and the Europe India Gateway, were cut, impacting global internet and telecommunications.

The article explicitly states that these cables are crucial for data moving from Asia to Europe and that the cuts affect 25% of the traffic through the Red Sea.

Furthermore, it discusses the implications of these cuts amidst ongoing Houthi attacks, indicating that the topic of cut sea cables is central rather than a minor mention.

**KARACHI:** Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) is set to invest in another international submarine cable consortium system expected to be operational in the last quarter of 2015, said a press release on Friday.

This will be the fourth submarine cable system by PTCL – a subsidiary of United Arab Emirate’s Etisalat – representing a multimillion dollar investment. The new cable, to be laid in collaboration with leading operators in the region, will span from the Far East to Europe, with multiple landing points in the Middle East.

“With this cable, PTCL will be adding terabits of bandwidth to its international capacity, along with increasing its existing international infrastructure on the eastern and western side of the Arabian Sea,” the statement said.

This investment will help the company cater to growing demand from both retail consumers and businesses in the country for broadband and data services. The new cable link synergizes with PTCL’s three existing cable consortium systems: South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 3 (SMW3), South East Asia-Middle-East Western Europe 4 (MW4), and India-Middle East-Western Europe (I-ME-WE).

“It is anticipated that the agreement will be signed before the end of this year and the cable will be operational as early as in the last quarter of 2015,” the statement said.

This new cable system is expected to further boost the proliferation of broadband connectivity in Pakistan and meet capacity needs of future applications spurring the development of information and communications technology in Pakistan.

It may be recalled here that SMW4 and I-ME-WE, two of the four undersea cables that connect Pakistan globally, were damaged earlier this year, slowing down the country’s internet connectivity by half. The new undersea cable consortium system will be an additional lifeline for the country’s internet connectivity in case of a similar damage in the future.

Presently, Transworld Associates (TWA) and PTCL act as the internet gateway to Pakistan and provide bandwidth to local internet service providers. Pakistan is connected with the cyber world through four undersea fiber optic cables: I-ME-WE, SMW3, SMW4 owned by PTCL and TWA-1, owned by Transworld.

According to the Vice Minister of Telecommunication, Boris Moreno, the government is unable to offer Cubans comprehensive Internet for their new PCs because the American embargo prevents it from getting service directly from the United States nearby through underwater cables. Instead, Cuba gets Internet service through less reliable satellite connections, usually from faraway countries including Italy and Canada.

Documents released by WikiLeaks reveal that Cuba and Venezuela signed a confidential contract in 2006 to lay an undersea fibre-optic cable that bypasses the United States. The cable is to be completed by 2010.

The contract between the two countries, which has been independently verified, adds weight to Cuban statements that the United States economic embargo of the island has forced it to rely on slow and expensive satellite links for Internet connectivity. Cuba is situated a mere 120 kilometres off the coast of Florida. The proposed 1,500 kilometre cable will connect Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti and Trinidad to the rest of the world via La Guaira, Venezuela.

- Increase the volume and variety of relationships between country members of ALBA (Bolivarian Alternative for America) and the South American MERCOSUR trading block.
- Help serve the increasing demand of commercial traffic between Cuba, Venezuela and the rest of the world.

The South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 5 submarine cable broke down in Singapore Friday night, affecting internet services in Bangladesh.

The SEA-ME-WE 5 submarine cable is Bangladesh’s second submarine cable installed in Kuakata, and one of the largest suppliers of international bandwidth in the country.

Mirza Kamal Ahmed, managing director of the Bangladesh Submarine Cables PLC (BSCPLC), said that the Bangladesh authorities were not aware as to when the problem could be fixed. ‘The SEA-ME-WE 5 consortium is yet to identify the cause of the problem. Possibly, we think, any ship’s anchor may have hit the cable,’ he added.

Multiple broadband internet users in Bangladesh said that they faced disturbance while browsing the internet as loading websites was taking too much time, and operating internet-based works was becoming impossible since midnight past Friday.

International bandwidth usage in Bangladesh is around 5,200 Gbps and about 1,700 Gbps of that bandwidth is supplied by the SEA-ME-WE 5 submarine cable.

The SEA-ME-WE 5 is a 20,000km submarine cable system connecting 17 countries through Points-of-Presence from Singapore to the Middle East to France and Italy in Western Europe.

The cable of SEA-ME-WE 5 in the western side that connected Singapore got broken on Friday at 12:00am and all traffic between Kuakata-Singapore through the submarine cable is now shut down, according to BSCPLC’s press release issued on Saturday.

The BSCPLC is shifting a substantial amount of the intercepted bandwidth to SEA-ME-WE 4 submarine cable, the press release said.","The article titled 'Internet users face trouble as submarine cable breaks down' discusses the breakdown of the SEA-ME-WE 5 submarine cable, which is a direct reference to cut sea cables.

The AAG submarine cable is the largest internet data transmission cable in the world. Completed in 2009, this Asia-Pacific cable spans over 20,000 km and has a designed data capacity of 2 Terabits per second. It is a crucial cable connecting Southeast Asia to the United States, with a total investment of approximately $560 million.

**Key landing points of the AAG cable** include Mersing (Malaysia), Changi (Singapore), Sri Racha (Thailand), Tungku (Brunei), Vung Tau (Vietnam), Currimao (Philippines), South Lantau (Hong Kong), Guam (USA), and Hawaii (USA).

Currently, AAG is the first and only submarine cable providing direct internet data connection from Southeast Asia to the USA, making any cable cut incidents significantly impact internet access for countries in the region. Furthermore, AAG can connect to Australia, India, Europe, and Africa through other landing points in the system.

**How is the submarine cable repaired?**

Many might think that to repair a submarine cable, divers will descend with equipment to perform the task. However, the reality is different; all cable splicing work is done on specialized ships.

Divers cannot go deep due to extreme pressure; instead, machinery and specialized winching equipment are used to pull the broken cable from the seabed onto the ship. The two ends of the cable are secured using a special buoy system. Engineers then use specialized fiber optic splicing machines to join the small fibers together in a technical room on the ship.

After completing the splicing, the cable bundle is reinforced and protected as before and then released back to the seabed. The laying process requires specialized machinery to blow sand on the seabed, creating a trench to place the fiber optic cable, which is then covered with sand to minimize the risk of damage from impacts, cable theft, or shark bites.","The article discusses the AAG submarine cable, its significance, and the implications of cable cuts on internet connectivity.

Telecom operator Safaricom said it would source ""additional capacity with other undersea cable partners"" to make up for the shortfall in connectivity. MTN and Telkom, two South African telecom majors operating in East Africa, said they were trying to ""minimize"" the disruption.

Tanzania has experienced the most severe outage, data from the Internet Outage Detection and Analysis project at the Georgia Institute of Technology shows. The US embassy in the country was closed to the public for two days until May 15 following the downtime, except for in cases of emergencies involving American citizens.

### Know More

The outage mirrors similar events in March, when cuts to four cables disrupted internet access in Nigeria, Ghana and other West African countries. For days, service providers only offered intermittent connection to users, stifling online banking activities, Ghana’s stock exchange, and other internet-based services.

Connectivity in East Africa was also limited in February when three submarine cables that run through the Red Sea were damaged. The International Cable Protection Committee, a group representing 98% of subsea cable operators, said the breaks were likely caused by the anchor of a cargo ship that was shot at by the Yemen-based Houthi rebel group. Those cables have not been repaired due to tensions over right of access to those waters.

Fixing the breaks on EASSy and Seacom may take several days to weeks, and may be ""dependent on weather, sea conditions and the extent of the damage,"" said Chris Wood, chief executive of the West Indian Ocean Cable Company, which helped Google to land a subsea cable in Africa. MainOne, an internet provider in West Africa, announced last week that its cables that were cut in March have now been repaired.

### Alexander’s view

Anxieties that have accompanied the three episodes of cable cuts in three months underscore Africa’s increased dependence on the internet for commerce and daily life.

Africa’s internet economy could reach $180 billion by 2025, according to estimates by Google and the World Bank’s private investment arm, the International Financial Corporation. That prospect should increase the sense of urgency among policymakers and service providers to build more resilience into the continent’s internet architecture.

Internet disruption in Africa tends to happen sub-regionally because cables run through multiple countries clustered together. ""East Africa has one of the most advanced regional integration programs, perhaps only outdone by the Southern African Customs Union and the Francophone units,"" said Bright Simons, research lead at IMANI Center for Policy and Education in Ghana.

""Yet, just like elsewhere, it has not been able to activate a regional framework for telecom emergencies like this, leaving operators to arrange ad hoc cross-border arrangements,"" Simons said. Telecom regulatory authorities should work out ""a contingency quasi-treaty"" to coordinate faster responses during such emergencies, he said.

Africa has seen an increase in submarine cables over the past two decades, including Google’s 15,000-kilometer South Africa to Portugal Equiano cable, and the 45,000-kilometer 2Africa project owned by a consortium led by Meta. They have sometimes come under criticism for ulterior motives: Two Mozilla-affiliated researchers said the tech giants’ cable projects ""are using colonialist tactics to exploit Africa on a massive scale,"" despite claiming to bridge the digital gap. But more cables has meant more capacity for internet access on the continent.

Merely having new cables is not enough for expanding Africa’s access to the internet. Integrating them into other critical national infrastructure and ensuring interoperability within each region is the key to long-term resilience.

### Step Back

The West Africa Cable System, which serves Nigeria and its neighbors, reported two breaks in the first half of 2020, while the Africa Coast to Europe (ACE) line’s break in 2018 resulted in a total internet blackout in Mauritania for two days.

ACE was Mauritania’s sole submarine cable connection, but plans have since been launched for a second connection.

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Two telecommunication companies in Haiti said their fiber optic cables were severed this week, temporarily leaving customers without service in what were suspected acts of sabotage by criminal gangs.

Digicel Haiti, one of Haiti’s biggest telecom companies, said one of its cables was cut on Thursday in the community of Martissant near the capital of Port-au-Prince, considered ground zero for warring gangs. The cable affects customers in Haiti’s western region, and it also had been severed earlier in the week.

Meanwhile, Access Haiti said some of its fiber optic cables were cut on Monday in what it described as an act of “sabotage.”

The two companies, when contacted by The Associated Press, declined to say how many of their customers were affected.

HGC Communications, a telecom operator in Hong Kong, reported yesterday that it was rerouting traffic, after the Seacom/TGN, AAE-1 and EIG cables were cut, estimating that 25% of traffic is disrupted.

HGC’s measures include rerouting northbound traffic from Asia via China to Europe, routing through the US to Europe and diversifying its West bound traffic through the other 11 cables that run through the Red Sea.

Seacom confirmed the damage to CNN, with chief digital officer Prenesh Padayachee saying repair works could take up to eight weeks to commence while permits from the Yemeni maritime authority are issued.

Tata Communications said in a statement to _Capacity_ that it has been keeping a close watch on the situation and initiated immediate and appropriate remedial actions.

“We invest in various cable consortiums to increase our diversity and hence in such situations of a cable cut or snag we are able to automatically reroute our services, thereby ensuring our customers have a stable, reliable and scalable connectivity,” Tata said.

In response to the outages, Roderick Beck, global network capacity sourcing at United Cable Company said everyone is looking for wavelengths on the SMW5 cable that links Singapore to Marseille.

“I am seeing tremendous demand for alternative subsea cable capacity from Marseille to Singapore,” he told _Capacity._

“Within 24 hours of the Red Sea outages, almost two terabits of SMW5 capacity was reserved on two Asian carrier backbones,” he added.

On the timeline for repairs Beck said:

“There are reports that ships are on the way to repair the cables. Probably not true. First of all, you need an available ship and most are already at sea laying fibre optic or power cables.”

“Secondly, a ship must return to the port where the spare fibre is stored and retrieve it. Every subsea cable has a storage depot where as much as 60 kilometers of spare fibre is kept for repairs, slack, and extensions.”

“Then the repair ship must set sail, locate the point of damage, and fix it. In this case the repair ship must also arrange military escort as well and that is a low priority for the navies patrolling the Red Sea.”

AAE-1 is a 25,000km consortium cable system connecting South East Asia to Europe via Egypt, with nineteen operators as members, including TeleYemen.

The EIG (Europe India Gateway) cable connects the UK to India, via Mediterranean Europe, and is owned by sixteen operators.

Speculation is rife that the Rubymar cargo ship, a UK vessel struck by a Houthi rebel missile is responsible for the damage.

“Since the Rubymar went to its watery grave early Saturday morning local time, I suspect the immediate threat of more outages has passed,” Beck said.

The Yemen-based and Iranian-backed Houthi’s have been targeting ships in response to the Israeli offensive against Palestine.

Industry sources are reporting that the ships anchor could have been dragging across the seabed before it sunk on Saturday, damaging cables in the process.

Last week, Yemen’s government said it was keen to ensure that telecom cables were not damaged and would provide facilities for damaged cables to be repaired and maintained.","The article discusses the cutting of undersea cables, specifically the Seacom/TGN, AAE-1, and EIG cables, and its impact on telecommunications traffic.

FPT Telecom announced to its customers that in early March, the AAG (Asia America Gateway) undersea cable will undergo maintenance, causing slowdowns in international internet connectivity.

Specifically, the maintenance will take place from 2 PM on March 4 to 4 PM on March 6. In the notice sent to customers, FPT Telecom indicated that the international traffic to Singapore will experience reduced capacity for services such as Google, Facebook, and news access hosted outside Vietnam.

**FPT Internet Services Unaffected**

Mr. Vu Anh Tu stated that FPT Telecom rarely utilizes international traffic through this route, so the maintenance will have minimal impact on customers. Additionally, FPT Telecom has significantly increased its international traffic capacity recently to prepare for any incidents.

""FPT Telecom has proactively implemented measures to minimize the impact on users,"" Mr. Tu shared. ""Specifically, we have added international connection capacity both overland and underwater to upgrade the transmission network system and ensure internet capacity is available in the event of incidents.""

In the past 8 months, the AAG network has not experienced any incidents. This maintenance is part of the regular schedule by the cable's operating unit.

In Cuba, mystery shrouds fate of Internet cable

HAVANA (AP) — It was all sunshine, smiles and celebratory speeches as officials marked the arrival of an undersea fiber-optic cable they promised would end Cuba’s Internet isolation and boost web capacity 3,000-fold. Even a retired Fidel Castro had hailed the dawn of a new cyber-age on the island.

More than a year after the February 2011 ceremony on Siboney Beach in eastern Cuba, and 10 months after the system was supposed to have gone online, the government never mentions the cable anymore, and Internet here remains the slowest in the hemisphere. People talk quietly about embezzlement torpedoing the project and the arrest of more than a half-dozen senior telecom officials.

Perhaps most maddening, nobody has explained what happened to the much-ballyhooed $70 million project.

“They did some photo-op … and then that scandal came out, and then it just disappeared from human consciousness,” said Larry Press, a professor of information systems at California State University, Dominguez Hills, who studies Cuba, referring to foreign media reports and whispers by diplomats that several executives at state phone company Etecsa and the two senior officials in the Telecommunications Ministry were arrested last year.

The cable was strung from Venezuela with the help of key ally Hugo Chavez. Government officials said from the start that the bandwidth boon would be prioritized for hospitals, universities and other usage deemed in service of the common good; the legions of Cubans with little or no access to the Internet from their homes would have to wait.

But a dozen employees of public institutions interviewed by The Associated Press said they have seen no noticeable improvement in their work connections. If anything, they say, download speeds have even gotten a little slower.

According to a statement from Bangladesh Submarine Cables PLC (BSCPLC) – which is a stakeholder in SEA-ME-WE 5 – the break occurred 440 km from the Singapore end of the cable just after midnight on April 20. Consequently, all traffic between Singapore and SEA-ME-WE 5’s landing station in Kuakata is down.

BSCPLC said that international internet traffic has been rerouted onto SEA-ME-WE 4, which is the only other international subsea cable with a landing point in Bangladesh (in Cox's Bazar, rather than Kuakata).

However, the loss of SEA-ME-WE 5 means Bangladesh has lost close to 1.7 Tbps of international capacity – compared to around 800 Gbps on SEA-ME-WE 4 – which is impacting internet speeds across the country, BSCPLC said.

According to the Daily Star, Bangladesh is still able to access about 100 Gbps of capacity from the west side of SEA-ME-WE 5 that runs to France. It also has another 2.7 Tbps of terrestrial capacity via international terrestrial cable (ITC) licence holders that import bandwidth from India.

The 20,000-km SEA-ME-WE 5 cable connects 17 countries between Singapore and France. Between Singapore and Bangladesh, the cable also has landing points in Malaysia, Indonesia and Myanmar.

The cause of the break has not yet been revealed. Ironically, BSCPLC had announced last Thursday that maintenance work was scheduled to be performed on SEA-ME-WE 5 between 3am and 4am on Friday morning, which would cause “partial interruptions” in internet services during that time.

**Are We (St Helena) Getting a Fibre-Optic Cable or Not – The Latest….**
It has been 15 months since Dr. Rosalind Thomas of the SAEX submarine cable project visited St Helena and promised the cable to become operational in mid 2020. Since then it has become alarmingly quiet around the cable‘s progress. Although the European Union has provided £18 million for the 50km branch to St Helena, the funding of the trunk cable between South Africa and Brazil is still in murky waters and as the required seabed survey has still not happened the commissioning date has already slipped at least by a year to 2021 if it materializes at all.

It has always been clear that St Helena cannot afford a dedicated cable to Africa or Latin America as the cost of such would run into the hundreds of millions. The only way to land a fibre optic cable on St Helena would be when another cable runs close to the island from where a short branch to the island could be forked off. Unfortunately, the only other cable project to come close to the island, Seaborn Networks‘ SABR cable (South Africa-Brazil) has not made any progress either, leaving us in desperation. However, with both the SAEX and SABR proposed cable projects finding it difficult to turn ideas into reality, two other proposals for South Atlantic cable routes are emerging.

Last week the Wall Street Journal revealed that two of the world‘s largest Internet companies known for their multi-billion investments in submarine cables, Facebook and Google, are both working on two separate cable systems around the African continent. Facebook‘s “Simba” cable would encircle the African continent while Google‘s “Equiano” cable would be laid off Africa‘s western coast. Large telecom companies like MTN Group and Vodafone are believed to be partners in these cable projects that will connect European and Asian data centres to the growing African telecom markets where more and more people use Facebook‘s and Google‘s services.

In February 2019, I spent an enjoyable and informative couple of days attending the Submarine Networks EMEA conference in London updating myself on what’s happening in the submarine cable world - particularly in the South America region.

For as long as I can remember there has been an interest in the Falklands Islands about whether there was a possibility of connecting the islands to the rest of the world using a submarine cable rather than suffering the constrained bandwidth and long delays of the geostationary satellite currently used. However, there is also a pragmatic acceptance in the populace that this was not possible though the reasons have never been fully explained in a public forum as far as I am aware.

Until 2011, this was a similar view held by inhabitants of St Helena but that is now all about to change and it shows what can be achieved by community pressure supported by the St Helena Government.

Today St Helena residents and businesses are connected to the rest of the world using a geo-stationary Intelsat satellite link. This methodology is exactly the same as used in other South Atlantic islands including the Ascension Island and Falkland Islands. Indeed, all three islands use the same organisation for all their external telecommunication needs. The use of a traditional geostationary satellite is costly leading to a low-level of satellite capacity that is unable to support the quality of Internet seen in all terrestrially connected countries and islands.

There was little, if no, possibility of connecting St Helena with a submarine cable with only a population of just over 4000 until the announcement of the trans-Atlantic ‘South Atlantic Express’ (SAEx1) submarine cable in 2011. SAEx1 is capable of carrying 108Tbit/s of data connecting Cape Town in South Africa to Virginia Beach in the USA.

**The SAEx1 submarine Cable**

The project was announced in 2011 and by 2014 a number of parties had expressed interest in its finance. Back then its total cost was estimated to be £160m – not an insignificant amount (However, submarine cable build costs are plummeting year-on-year so it will cost considerably less in 2020). Though it was planned to pass nearby St Helena there was no vision to land it on the island leaving St Helena to carry on suffering a low-capacity satellite link for all its external communications.

It took the creativity of one individual, Christian von der Ropp, to realise that an opportunity that must not be missed was now possible with the building of the SAEx submarine cable. Talking with Christian a while back and at the submarine conference, he said that a friend of his visited St Helena and was appalled at the slow speed of the Internet encountered. Christian thought about this for a while and in 2012 came up with the idea to create a campaign called “Move This Cable” launched by A Human Right. A very active website ensued to lobby landing the cable on St Helena. This project was fully supported by the St Helena Government taking a visionary view of the importance of the project to the islands.

In 2012 eFive Telecoms (Pty) Ltd announced that they would reroute the SAEx cable to pass-by St Helena allowing a short ‘branch’ to St Helena to be built after a successful and coordinated lobbying campaign. The cable is expected to go live in 2020 after two earlier delays in 2014 and 2017. A branch to Ascension island would also be built.

On 27th October 2017, the St Helena Government announced that it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding for a branch from the SAEx cable to the island to be ready in early 2020.

It’s also most interesting to see that SHG also announced the negotiation of a 21M Euro grant/loan from the European Development Fund (EDF) with the aid of the UK Government’s Department for International Development (DFID). These discussions were led by Paul McGinnety, Assistant Chief Secretary at St Helena Government and Dax Richards, Financial Secretary at St Helena Government.

> _“SHG is pleased to announce that it has recently received confirmation from the European Commission that St Helena’s bid for funding from the 11th European Development Fund (EDF11) through a Budget Support Programme has passed the 2nd quality support group (QSG 2). This essentially has given the go ahead for St Helena’s programme amounting to €21.5 million to be formally submitted to the Commissioners for approval. This funding is intended to support the delivery of the Digital Strategy through the realisation of a Submarine Cable to the Island with some funding earmarked for both Ascension and Tristan da Cunha.”_

In October 2018, SAEx announced that the SAEx link from Fortaleza to Virginia Beach would now use Sparkle’s existing fibre pairs in their Seabras-1 cable system. This partnership should significantly reduce the build cost and time of SAEx1. Interestingly, Microsoft has been on board as the foundational customer for Seabras-1 from the beginning and fully participates in the Seabras-1 cable system. Alcatel Submarine Networks (ASN) has been chosen as the contractor to build SAEx. ASN will deliver the full project, end-to-end, including network design, manufacturing, installation and commissioning.

**The SAEx1 submarine Cable**

The SAEx cable should provide 200Gbit/s backhaul capacity to the island of St Helena from 2020. But, even with the grant negotiated there will be a very high cost for maintenance of the SAEx branch to St Helena. For example, the most expensive possible cost that could be encountered is if the branch breaks possibly caused by an anchor drag in shallow water. The cost of contracting a cable repair ship can be $50-60k per day and could take five or six days to find and repair the break. If a ship is not available in the Atlantic then it could take several weeks to arrive. The total cost of this could easily exceed $1m and don’t forget the loss of all island connectivity during that time.","The article 'St Helena's submarine cable' discusses submarine cables extensively, particularly focusing on the South Atlantic Express cable and its implications for St. Helena's connectivity.

The Associated Press reports that a planned undersea high-speed fibre-optic cable from Venezuela to Cuba will not be ready for service until July 2011 at the earliest, whilst project costs have risen to an expected USD70 million from an earlier reckoning of USD63 million. The Cuban Communist Party-backed newspaper Granma quoted Alberto Rodriguez, Cuba’s vice minister of information and communications, as predicting the ten-month timeframe for the 5,000km project linking Cuba, Jamaica, and Venezuela, although he did not reveal any details of how far work had progressed. Alcatel-Lucent is under contract to roll out the international cable link, which was first announced in January 2007 to end Cuba’s reliance on satellites and reduce the cost of telephony and internet services on the island, according to TeleGeography’s GlobalComms Database.

As previously reported in CommsUpdate, Venezuelan/Cuban joint venture Telecomunicaciones Gran Caribe (TGC) was granted a licence in November 2009 to install a submarine cable between Caracas (Venezuela), Havana (Cuba), and Kingston (Jamaica). TGC was the sole bidder for the concession, which includes a spur to Haiti. TGC is 60% owned by state-run Telecom Venezuela with the remainder held by Cuba’s Telco Transbit.

The cable was laid by the French company Alcatel-Lucent.

For days, and though the Cuban government hasn’t commented on the matter, word on the street has it that the fiber optic cable linking the towns of La Guaira (Venezuela) and Siboney (Cuba) doesn’t exist.

That’s right, it’s turned out that the most anxiously awaited cable in the history of Cuba “died before being born.” According to these rumors in the street, it was eaten by “sharks.”

They say it was due to poor quality materials, which simplified the tasks of the insatiable barracudas in the Caribbean.

According to that “hearsay,” this occurred even though the cable was expressly purchased by high-level executive administrators of the Ministry of Communications.

Yet this must have some truth, given the arrests and subsequent imprisonment of two deputies engaged in “performing other important tasks” for that agency’s then minister, Ramiro Valdes.

This all takes me back to my childhood days, when my elementary schoolteacher told me about some “very bad ministers” during the pre-revolutionary years of the Republic. They stole everything, including funds for children’s school breakfasts.

In my infantile innocence, those men were the bad guys,” but they were also long-gone characters, despised to the point that they would never again gain a foothold in our country.

The truth is that today, at least in in my opinion, the real sharks that “ate the cable” live far from the depths of the Caribbean. Their habitat is located inside air-conditioned luxury cars, or beside the pools at “their homes,” with lobster and shrimp dishes, each of them with a glass of whiskey on one side and a pretty woman on the other.

The “sharks” that feasted on the $70 million cable that stretches between La Guaira and Siboney await cautiously for the “day after,” that’s why today they “stretch and stretch” the stitched-up guise of “comrade” for when the time comes, fully take advantage, this time of without restrictions of movement.

What’s more, they say that one of them likes to compare the Internet with “a wild horse yet to be tamed.” Perhaps behind this smile is concealed the real reason why he made sure the much-desired cable would never reach us. At least for now, the new era will not come at the galloping speed of such untamable stallions.","The article discusses a fiber optic cable intended to connect Cuba and Venezuela, describing its failure and the implications of that failure, including the metaphorical notion of it being 'eaten by sharks.'

"Cuba's Internet Connectivity Challenges Amid Undersea Cable Limitations","Only 16% of Cubans online due to U.S. trade embargo limiting access to undersea cables; reliance on expensive satellite service highlighted.","https://phys.org/news/2011-07-cuba-percent-online-capacity.html","2011-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","By ANDREA RODRIGUEZ, Associated Press",Yes,"Andrea Rodriguez","Douglas, Isle of Man","5000","2011-07-08","English","Phys.org","(AP) -- About 16 percent of Cubans are online in some capacity with access to email, the island's intranet or the worldwide Web, a government agency says.

Cuba's National Statistics Office said in a report posted online this week that nearly 1.8 million of the country's 11.2 million residents used some kind of ""Internet service"" in 2010, a 12 percent increase from 1.6 million the previous year.

The report shows a generally steady increase since 2005.

The U.S. trade embargo has long kept Cuba from connecting to nearby undersea fiber-optic cables, forcing the island to rely on slow, expensive satellite service.

Cuba currently has the second-worst connectivity rates on the planet, according to a report by Akamai Technologies Inc. But a $70 million undersea cable laid with Venezuelan help arrived this year and could come online as early as this month.

The new usage figure is separate from a survey last year by the same office that found only 2.9 percent of Cubans reported having access to the Internet, mostly through schools and workplaces.

The previous survey likely suffered from underreporting of access to black market dial-up accounts. It also was apparently more narrowly focused on direct access to the Web.

The island's intranet is a limited but more widely available online service in which people can surf local sites and open email accounts to send and receive correspondence, including to and from other countries.

Outside experts put the real number of Cubans with access to the larger worldwide Web at about 5 percent to 10 percent.

Cuba treats its limited bandwidth as a precious resource and gives priority to usage deemed to have social merit, such as at universities. Scarce home dial-up accounts are expensive and not available to most Cubans.

The Statistics Office's new report also cited a boom in cellphone usage since President Raul Castro loosened restrictions in 2008. While mobile users numbered just 200,000 in 2007, just over 1 million were registered by last year, it said.

According to HGC Global Communications, the damage has disrupted around a quarter of data traffic travelling through the volatile region.

This week, official statements from Hong Kong-based HGC Global Communications have confirmed that three submarine cable systems – the Asia-Africa-Europe 1, the Europe India Gateway, and the Seacom-TGN-Gulf systems – have been severed in the Red Sea.

The cables carry large volumes of data traffic from Asia to Europe, much of which is currently being rerouted over 11 neighbouring submarine systems.

According to HGC, the damage impacts roughly 25% of data traffic passing through the Red Sea.

Processes related to repairing the cables are reportedly already underway, though these are likely to take a number of weeks, particularly given the ongoing conflict in the local area.

Exactly what has caused the damage to the cables has yet to be revealed – indeed, it is hard to ascertain the causes of cable damage before the cables have been dredged up for repairs – though there are fears that it could deliberate sabotage by the Houthi rebels currently attacking Western shipping operations nearby.

At the end of last year, Houthi-linked media published a map showing the local submarine cable systems, along with ambiguous messaging that could hint at the infrastructure being a potential target for attack.

However, the Houthi rebels deny sabotaging the cables, instead blaming the increased Western naval presence for the disruption.

“The hostilities on Yemen by the British and U.S. naval military units caused a disruption in the submarine cables in the Red Sea, which jeopardized the security and safety of international communications and the normal flow of information,” said a statement from Yemen’s Transportation Ministry, which is currently under Houthi control.

Submarine cables being severed is, in fact, a fairly common occurrence, with cables typically being damaged by becoming entangled in trawling nets or on a ship's anchor.

Deliberate attacks on submarine infrastructure are incredibly rare, requiring both knowledge of the cable’s precise location as well as the case to disrupt the cables sometimes hundreds of metres beneath the surface.

While the submarine cables near Yemen’s coastline are, in places, only around 100 metres deep, the chances of them being specifically targeted by the rebels seems slim, particularly given the local military presence throughout the area.","The article discusses the severing of three submarine cable systems in the Red Sea, detailing the disruption of 25% of data traffic and the ongoing repair efforts.

To ensure stable and uninterrupted connectivity for customers, CMC Telecom proactively developed a contingency plan and supplemented sufficient traffic through other connections. CMC Telecom also arranged personnel to support and respond, ready to serve customers 24/7 during the recovery process to ensure 100% quality for customers in the near future.

The cause of this incident is currently under investigation, and the recovery time has not yet been announced.

On Sunday, May 12, two submarine cables (Seacom and EASSy) suffered breaks along a stretch of coastline between the cable landing stations in Mtunzini, South Africa and Maputo, Mozambique. It was the latest in a historically bad run of submarine cable failures that have led to disruptions of internet service around the continent of Africa.

Impacts were observed from Kenya down the east coast of Africa to South Africa beginning just before 07:30 UTC. Among the East African countries impacted, Tanzania experienced the most severe disruption, according to Kentik’s aggregate NetFlow.

If we start the timeline of this run of misfortune last summer, we can include the undersea landslide in the Congo Canyon last August that took out multiple cables along the West Coast of Africa.

In February, multiple submarine cables connecting Europe and Asia were cut in an incident in the Red Sea on February 24. Having been attacked by Houthis from Yemen, the CS Rubymar was abandoned and left to drift at sea. Ultimately, its anchor snagged and cut three cables in the sea inlet’s shallow waters.

Finally on March 14, four submarine cables suffered failures off the coast of Côte d’Ivoire over a period of 5.5 hours. The suspected cause was an undersea landslide in the Trou sans Fond.

Vodacom Tanzania was one of the most impacted providers in East Africa. On May 15, they announced a full restoration of services, but BGP data reveals the scramble to re-establish connectivity immediately following the loss of the submarine cables on the 12th.

Conversely, Safaricom of Kenya was largely able to weather the loss of the cables by reverting to other sources of transit.

The most visible impact were measurements between cloud regions in South Africa and Asia. Latencies were observed to increase dramatically as traffic was redirected along longer geographic paths due to the loss of these cables.

These examples once again prove that the cloud providers must rely on the same submarine cable infrastructure as everyone else and can be impacted by cable cuts in similar manners.

In the past decade, the number of submarine cables serving the continent of Africa has nearly doubled, leading many internet infrastructure observers to believe that this abundance of cables contributed to a greater degree of resilience. However, in the past nine months, Africa has endured four separate cable incidents, each resulting in the failures of multiple submarine cables.

We’ll need to learn what was the cause of this latest incident. While we are waiting, it is worth considering that WIOCC’s EASSy cable and the Seacom cable failed within minutes of each other. Hopefully these are the last submarine cable breaks to disrupt African connectivity for a very long time.","The article discusses multiple incidents of submarine cable failures, specifically the Seacom and EASSy cables, which directly impacted internet connectivity in East Africa.

Mr Roberts, from the pan-Africa company Liquid Intelligent Technologies, said that he had confirmed that one cable that runs alongside the coast of East Africa, known as Eassy, had been cut earlier on Sunday some 45km (28 miles) north of the South African port city of Durban.  

Another cable was also cut. He ruled out the idea that it could be sabotage and said it was rather an unhappy coincidence.  

Other cables linking East Africa to Europe are also available and gradually the service should improve as data is re-routed. But as a lot of big companies have data centres in South Africa the damage to the vital link that Eassy provides had a big impact.  

In March, widespread outages were reported in countries including South Africa, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Benin, Ghana and Burkina Faso. This was also put down to cable failures. The cause was not clear but led to the frustration of millions of customers around the continent.","The article discusses significant internet outages in East Africa due to faults in undersea cables, specifically mentioning that the Eassy cable was cut, which had a major impact on connectivity.

The Cuban regime, more wary of bloggers than traditional dissidents, decided to expand its online presence to combat them. Now that Venezuelan fibre optic cable is available on the island, the authorities have what they need to improve connection speeds and lower costs. There are fewer and fewer excuses for maintaining censorship or keeping the population away from the Web. Are we witnessing signs of a Web Springtime, now that the journalists persecuted during the Black Springtime of March 2003 have all been released from prison?

**Fibre optic cable in Cuba: Unprecedented potential for growth?**

According to the authorities, nearly 10% of Cuba’s population is connected to the Internet. That does not necessarily mean that they have access to the World Wide Web. Two parallel networks co-exist on the island: the international network and a closely monitored Cuban intranet consisting only of an encyclopaedia, email addresses ending in “.cu” used by universities and government officials, and a few government news websites.

Outside of hotels, only a few privileged individuals have a special permit to access the international network. Yet even the latter does not escape censorship, which is mainly directed against dissident publications on foreign websites, but has been relaxed to some extent since early February 2011.

The regime does not have the means to set up a systematic filtering system, but it counts on several factors to restrict Internet access: the exorbitant cost of connections, infrastructural problems, particularly slow connections, and the blame on the American embargo for the lack of good Web connection.

The ALBA-1 fibre optic undersea cable, linking Cuba to Venezuela since February 2011, is expected to increase Cuba’s capacity to connect to the world 3000-fold. However, it is unlikely that Internet access will be democratized.

**Resourcefulness**

A black market has prospered in Cuba for buying or “renting” passwords for Internet access.

Some international network connections can be accessed from foreign or private residences. Certain dissidents tweet by sending SMS via foreign-based accounts, while others insert foreign SIM cards into their cell phones to access the Net. Freelance bloggers do not have direct access to their websites and must rely on friends abroad to publish their articles.

**Demonising bloggers and social networks: A digital cold war?**

The regime has become wary of the growing popularity of certain bloggers, notably Yoani Sanchez. The legal arsenal used against online opposition remains harsh, with Cuban netizens risking severe penalties for posting articles deemed “counter-revolutionary.”

The authorities are striving to expand their presence on the Web, forming an official bloggers association in 2009 and increasing the number of “pro-government” bloggers. Since 9 February, some opposition blogs are accessible again from the island for those who can connect to the international network.","The article 'Cuba: enemy of the Internet' discusses the ALBA-1 fibre optic undersea cable linking Cuba to Venezuela, highlighting its potential to increase internet capacity significantly.

Lam Quoc Cuong, representative of Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications (VNPT), told news website Zing on Friday that a new undersea cable with a speed of 54 terabytes per second will go live next year. It will be a lot faster than the 2.88 Tb/s speed of the AAG, or Asia America Gateway, which links Vietnam and the US, he said.

At a length of 10,400 kilometers, the new cable, known as the Asia Pacific Gateway, will connect the central city of Da Nang with Singapore, Malaysia, and Japan. VNPT and military-owned Viettel are among the main investors of the cable, besides Japan's NTT Docomo, China Telecom, and China Unicom, according to Cuong.

Pham Dinh Truong of Viettel was quoted as saying that his company has also invested in a 25,000-kilometer cable connecting Vietnam with Europe. The Asia Africa Euro 1 is too scheduled to go into operation next year.

The Ministry of Information and Communication recently announced that Vietnam will also build a land cable to China, the news website reported.

Since 2011, the 20,000-kilometer AAG, which is used by major Internet providers VNPT, FPT Telecom, Viettel, and SPT, has broken or been shut down for maintenance on several occasions. This year alone it has snapped three times. Its latest rupture took place on April 23, and even though it was supposedly fixed on May 15, local connection has not fully recovered yet.

As a result, the cable's management company early this week announced that the AAG will have a 10-day maintenance starting this Sunday.

By Circles Robinson  
Published Date: 02/12/2023  

An agreement signed between Cuba and French company Orange LLC. to install a submarine communications cable between Cuba and Martinique became public news on December 7, 2022.  

Seven days before, the United States Department of Justice had made a recommendation to the Federal Communications Commission to reject the authorization request made by the companies ARCOS-1 USA Inc. and SurNet Inc., since 2018, to connect a fiber optic cable between the US and Cuba.  

The international Arimao submarine cable, which began to be installed at the Tricontinental Port in Cienfuegos, touched land in Martinique on January 10, 2023, according to ETECSA. A branch of the Orange Group, called Orange Marine, is responsible for the technical work.  

The Cuban telecommunications company also announced that the possibility of ""expanding and diversifying international capacity in the face of growing demand for Internet and broadband services,"" are some of the benefits of installing the second fiber optic cable to the island, which joins the cable that already exists between Cuba and Venezuela (ALBA-1).  

Commercial relations between ETECSA and Orange LLC. come at a time when Cubans are complaining about constant Internet cuts and a slower connection than normal. However, statements from officials and brief posts on social media don’t explain what improvements will come with the new fiber optic cable.  

Almost 99% of total Internet traffic comes from undersea cables, the real “backbone” of global telecommunications. While Cuba is located in one of the areas with the highest density of submarine fiber optic cables, it has problems accessing the Internet, as most of its connections come via satellites.  

Looking at the map of undersea cables, you can see that four fiber optic cables are currently touching Cuban soil: Arimao, ALBA-1, and two that belong to the US Government. However, ALBA-1 is the only one that offers Internet services to Cubans.  

In 2007, Cuba and Venezuela announced they would install a submarine cable which would be able to multiply the data transmission.  

Gran Caribe led the project, a mixed Cuban-Venezuelan company. Preparatory work began in 2009 and the installation of 1630 km of cable began in January 2011.  

The news stifled any hope Cubans had about improved or greater Internet access across the country.  

In a Twitter thread about the start of installation works of the Arimao cable, users were skeptical of the project being a solution to Internet connection problems in Cuba.  

A file from Martinique authorities points out that Orange LLC. filed a request for the submarine telecommunications cable on November 15, 2021.  

During the start of works to deploy the system in Cuba, it was stated that a station had been built to house technical services.  

Expectations have grown with the arrival of this new chance to increase connectivity; but it seems that it will still be a while before Cubans are able to enjoy quality cellphone and Internet services without coverage problems.  

Some Internet access problems in Cuba go beyond those linked satellite and submarine cable connections.  

Statistics tell us that over 6.7 million Cubans connect to the Internet using mobile data; the number of users grew by over a million in 2022 alone.  

Complaints about the quality and stability of this service are repeated on social media, while official organizations propose half-cooked solutions.  

The executive pretends he doesn’t know about VoLTE technology that allows you to make calls using 4G and instead blames users for using it wrong.  

This situation has two outcomes: poor audio quality, and problems navigating the Internet during a phone call.  

Velazquez also gave a statement about reusing the frequency spectrum, which is key with cellphones.  

In Cuba, 4G could operate at a bandwidth of 700 MHz, which is extremely attractive, because it allows for greater coverage with less infrastructure.  

However, enabling the 700 MHz frequency for mobile networks is only being worked on slowly.  

Overall, while the new submarine cable brings hope, significant challenges remain for improving internet connectivity in Cuba.","The article ""Internet in Cuba and the New Fiber Optic Cable"" discusses submarine cables, specifically the Arimao cable connecting Cuba to Martinique and the ALBA-1 cable connecting Cuba to Venezuela.

It addresses the implications of these submarine cables on internet connectivity in Cuba, highlighting the complaints about slow and unreliable internet service, which are indirectly related to issues with submarine cables.

The article emphasizes the importance of submarine cables, stating that almost 99% of internet traffic relies on them.

Although it does not explicitly mention ""cut sea cables,"" it treats submarine cables as a significant part of the discussion about internet access in Cuba, making it relevant to the criterion."

ISLAMABAD/KARACHI: A fault in the India-Middle East-Western Europe (IMEWE) submarine cable caused consumers and businesses across Pakistan major internet disruptions, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) said on Saturday, adding that customers may experience slow browsing speed.  
  
However, many people complained that they had no internet service at all.  
  
“The Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) has set up alternate routes to get the internet back up. The international team is dealing with the IMEWE and it will take a few days to sort out,” said PTCL spokesperson Imran Janjua.  
  
“At the moment, there are two submarine cables which are down — there was a similar issue in July this year and it is still being repaired,” he added.  
  
> PTA says traffic being rerouted through alternative routes; tech industry at a virtual standstill  
  
The PTA and PTCL did not confirm how long it would take to restore internet services in the country.  
  
The IMEWE submarine cable is an ultra-high capacity fibre optic undersea cable system which links India and Europe via the Middle East. The 12,091km-long cable has nine terminal stations, operated by leading telecom carriers from eight countries.  
  
“One of the PTCL cables has been cut near Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Currently, internet services are affected. However, PTCL is in process [of shifting] its traffic on alternate routes/cables and services will be better soon,” said PTA spokesperson Khurram Mehran.  
  
Khalid Bajwa of Patari, the country’s largest Pakistani music streaming platform, said that they had content scheduled to go up on social media on Saturday.  
  
“Everything has stopped. There were a couple of videos which had to go to a brand for approval but nothing has happened. We upload around three to four videos everyday and have been trying to do so since morning but no luck,” he told Dawn.  
  
WonderTree, a start-up run by Mohammad Waqas, also faced similar issues.  
  
“We are a technology start-up and we have not been able to do anything from morning to evening,” he said.  
  
“We had a lot of deadlines for Saturday, as it is the weekend and we needed to wind up a lot of things. Online banking was not available either, so we could not make payments. We just weren’t able to function,” he added.  
  
Akash Sheikh of Nest IO — a technology incubator — said: “It is of great concern that our internet connectivity nationwide has been affected. A strong internet link is essential for productivity and critical to our infrastructure.”  
  
Naseer Akhtar, chairman of the Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA), explained that such accidents happened all over the world, but stressed the necessity to invest in alternative routes for internet traffic, so businesses and people don’t suffer. “We’re lucky it happened over the weekend and not during a busy week,” he said.  
  
According to Mustafa Butt, an information technology entrepreneur, activities came to a halt at work throughout the day. “Luckily it is a holiday and there is not much of a work load,” he added.  
  
Mohammad Faisal, another IT entrepreneur, said that his entire day had been wasted. “Whatever little progress could be made was through mobile data. Most companies in the IT sector cannot afford the slightest disruption in internet service,” said the entrepreneur.  
  
The outage also impacted mobile networks and internet service providers. Although Nayatel messaged its subscribers that its links would up by evening, browsing remained slow. PTCL subscribers struggled with browsing till late Saturday evening.  
  
Wi-Tribe sent a message out to its customers explaining that “you might experience slow speed issue today due to a severe bandwidth degradation affecting all the internet service providers in Pakistan.”  
  
Internet services were also disrupted in July, when a similar fault with one of the PTCL submarine cables created an outage. It took several hours before the internet traffic — both incoming and outgoing — were routed through an alternative cable.

ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — A dozen countries across Africa suffered a major internet outage on Thursday as multiple undersea telecommunication cables reported failures, network operators and internet watch groups said.

The MTN Group, one of Africa’s largest network providers, said the ongoing disruptions were a result of failures in multiple major undersea cables. “Our operations are actively working to reroute traffic through alternative network paths,” the South African company said in a statement.

Network disruptions caused by cable damage have occurred in Africa in recent years. However, “today’s disruption points to something larger (and) this is amongst the most severe,” said Isik Mater, director of research at NetBlocks, a group that documents internet disruptions around the world.

NetBlocks said data transmission and measurement shows a major disruption to international transits, “likely at or near the subsea network cable landing points.”

The cause of the failure was not immediately clear.

There were fears of disruption of essential services in worst-hit countries like Ivory Coast where the disruption was severe. Africa leads mobile device web traffic in the world, with many of the continent’s businesses relying on the internet to deliver services to their customers.

The West Africa Cable System (WACS), the Africa Coast to Europe (ACE), SAT-3 and MainOne were among the system cables that observers said were affected in Thursday’s outage.

Internet analysis firm Cloudflare reported a pattern in the timing of the disruptions that heavily impacted at least 10 countries in West Africa, including Ivory Coast, Liberia, Benin, Ghana, and Burkina Faso.

Vodacom, South Africa’s mobile operator, also reported “intermittent connectivity issues due to multiple undersea cable failures.” Namibia and Lesotho were also affected.

The impact from such cable failures worsens as networks attempt to route around the damage, potentially reducing the capacity available to other countries, said Mater with NetBlocks.

“The initial disruption may be a physical cut, but subsequent issues could be of a technical nature,” said Mater.","The article titled 'Internet outage hits several African countries as undersea cables fail' discusses multiple failures of undersea telecommunication cables leading to significant internet outages across a dozen African countries.

"Tiny British Island Struggles for Undersea Fiber Connection","£10M funding plea for undersea fiber cable to restore internet connectivity for St Helena, impacting local development.","https://www.theregister.com/2013/01/03/st_helena_fibre","2013-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","Bill Ray",Yes,"Bill Ray","San Francisco, California, USA (HQ)
London, UK
Singapore","7000","2013-01-03","English","The Register","**Tiny British Island Struggles for Undersea Fiber Connection**

Days after walking away from the ITU treaty on global communications, which asked nations to connect up their islands, the UK confirmed it will not readily stump up the cash to do just that.

The island in question is St Helena, a British territory smack bang in the middle of the South Atlantic Ocean. Its inhabitants need £10m to hook into some nearby undersea fibre after persuading the cable's operator to swing the transatlantic connection closer to the isle. The islanders appealed to Blighty's Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) to ask the government to consider adopting the ITU's resolution on improving islands' net connections regardless of the outcome of the treaty negotiations.

But the UK is already committed to building a runway on St Helena for £250m and spends £20m annually keeping the place solvent. The thought of handing over an eight-figure sum for an optic fibre cable did not impress the FCO.

""The UK did not sign the revised International Telecommunication Regulations last week in Dubai, and has no intention of doing so in the future,"" the FCO stated in an email to The Register, providing its own emphasis when responding to a question about the island's connectivity campaigners.

For those who have forgotten, this ITU treaty is the international communication systems treaty against which Google campaigned so fiercely. The web giant managed to convince much of the world that the ITU agreement was a genuine threat to the freedom of the internet - not that Google cared enough to actually join the ITU: it prefers to lobby quietly and sent along staff as part of the US government delegation.

The high-speed South Atlantic Express fibre cable will run from Cape Town in South Africa to Fortaleza in Brazil. It was going to lie north of St Helena until campaigners convinced eFive Telecoms to route the connection further south. Now the islanders need someone to pay £10m or so to bridge the connection from a junction box on the cable to the island - that someone being the UK government and by extension its taxpayers.

There are about 4,200 people living on St Helena, which is too remote for all but the largest of aircraft and thus needs a decent airport if it's going to develop some tourism and reduce its reliance on a government subsidy. That's the plan that publicly justifies the expense of the airport, but with only 10Mb/sec of satellite connectivity to the internet (at best) shared between the whole population, tourists will really be able to get away from it all.

The fact that St Helena is on route to The Falklands is probably equally important to the airport plan. It's still 3,800 miles (6,200km) from the disputed islands, but that's a good deal closer than the UK. Having a decent airport there won't do any harm to our military aspirations, which won't be helped at all by fitting a 155Mbps internet connection even if it is a good deal cheaper.

MOGADISHU: Somalia has restored its internet connection after repairing a severed undersea cable, a telecoms official said on Monday, after an outage that the government said had cost the economy millions of dollars a day.

However, a police officer said attacks by militants had dropped during the outage that lasted more than three weeks. ""The internet is now back and clients are using it,"" said Adnan Ali, the media director for Hormuud Telecom, the country's top operator.

Businesses had to close or improvise to remain open during the shutdown and the telecoms minister told state radio it cost the equivalent of about US$10 million in daily economic output.

Information Minister Abdirahman Omar Osman apologised to citizens on Tuesday for the outage, which hit all landline and mobile users apart from those with access to private satellite connections, and called for them to have back-up plans. ""We urge internet companies to have a backup so that people do not suffer another outage in the future,"" he told Reuters.

Somalia's economy is picking up slowly after the army and an African Union peacekeeping force helped drive group al Shabaab out of Mogadishu and other strongholds. Al Shabaab wants to topple the Western-backed government and rule the country according to its strict interpretation of Sharia law.

Nur Bile, a police officer, said the number of reported attacks by al Shabaab had dropped during the outage, accusing the group of using the web to publicise its attacks and spread its ideology.

Residents said the resumption of internet access was welcome news. ""I have the chance to communicate with my lost friends and relatives,"" said 25-year old Aden Ismail.","The article titled 'Somalia restores internet connection after weeks of outage' directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables by stating that Somalia restored its internet connection after repairing a severed undersea cable.

In October last year, the Red Sea became a hotbed of paramilitary activity, with Yemeni Houthis beginning to attack commercial shipping, ostensibly as a result of the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas.

By February this year, the ‘Red Sea crisis’ had escalated to become a major issue for the international telecoms community, with submarine cables in the region being badly damaged, severely disrupting data traffic in Europe, Africa, and Asia.

Whether the damage to these cables was caused deliberately or not remains unclear, with one prominent theory suggesting that a ship being attacked by rebels hastily deployed its anchor, which then severed the cables.

To make matters worse, efforts to repair the affected cables were heavily delayed, both due to the militarised nature of the area, as well as by legal challenges related to the Yemeni government.

The impact of this lengthy saga on data transport in the region has been difficult to measure, but initial estimates suggested around 25% of data traffic had been affected. Today, however, a new whitepaper from RETN suggests that this figure has been drastically underestimated, with their own metrics putting the amount of traffic disrupted at up to 70%.

This figure is based on the company’s own network diagnostics and feedback from customers, including major consumer ISPs in Southeast Asia.

RETN uses this data as a springboard to discuss the wider issue of submarine cable system resiliency, calling for the creation of additional data routes to avoid ‘single points of failure’. Alongside the cable incidents in the Red Sea, the paper also points at damage to the SEA-ME-WE 5 cable in the Strait of Malacca – another submarine cable bottleneck – in April this year. This damage was particularly damaging to connectivity in Bangladesh, where SMW-5 is one of just two subsea cables connecting the country. According to the report, the damage to the cable reduced Bangladesh’s internet capacity by a third.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, smaller and less economically developed countries are less likely to be supported by a wider range of data transport routes, making them particularly vulnerable to largescale disruption.

“We are at a pivotal moment in network connectivity, and to be fully transparent, the industry is not equipped to meet current demands,” said RETN’s CEO Tony O’Sullivan. “With geopolitical events, natural disasters, cable cuts, design flaws, cybersecurity attacks and a shortage of new cables, we’re really not too far away from entire countries becoming digitally inaccessible when the one or two cables that connect them go down.”

The paper argues that the process of building the new systems is moving too slowly, hampered by geopolitical tensions, regulatory issues, and ongoing supply chain shortages.

RETN, therefore, is calling on industry to redouble its efforts in creating new data routes, calling for “at least 4 routes for any geography, preferably 5+” to ensure lasting resiliency.

“Having the global infrastructure in place to overcome these challenges requires industry-wide investment, but that means a wide-reaching movement of prioritising customers over short-term gains. Undoubtedly, there are some key players with the power that can take actionable steps immediately to make a difference,” said O’Sullivan.

This is the second time the AAG hit pause this year, following a reset last January.  

Internet connections in Vietnam are expected to run at snail’s pace in the coming week as a major undersea cable will go under repair.  

A local internet service provider said the Asia America Gateway (AAG) is being fixed and work will reach the part connected to Vietnam's southern beach town Vung Tau on Sunday. It is scheduled to finish on June 5.  

The incident would affect all service providers in Vietnam, meaning that internet users will have to face the sluggish speed on international websites.  

Several internet service providers are ready to reroute and transfer signals to other cables to minimize the impacts on users.  

This is the second time the AAG encountered a technical problem this year, following a reset last January, and at least five similar incidents in 2017.

The cable from Venezuela reached Cuba back in February, but the long awaited improved services and access have yet to materialize.

HAVANA TIMES, August 6 — The “ALBA-1” double fiber optic cable still doesn’t offer service to Internet and telephone users in Cuba. The date for activating the project has been put back several times, with the last missed benchmark being July.

Boris Moreno Cordoves, the vice minister of Communications & Informatics, now says that improved services could begin in September or October of this year.

The laying of the cable from Venezuela to Santiago de Cuba was completed in February.

Announcements have repeatedly been made concerning the implementation of a project that promises to multiply the speed of data, image and voice transmissions by 3,000 times the capacity that Cuba currently possesses.

Meanwhile, islanders have been waiting for the arrival of that moment with great expectations.

Internet users continue experiencing the same frustratingly slow and difficult access to the web (Cuba has one of the lowest connection rates in the hemisphere).

According to official figures, 1.6 million users accessed the Internet in Cuba in 2009 (of a population of 11.2 million). Nevertheless, that figure includes the great majority of those who don’t have full access; rather, they enjoy limited e-mail service or simply the national intranet, with many sites that are outdated.

For many years Cuba has attributed its connection limitations to the United States embargo, which has forced the island to use a satellite connection that is much slower and significantly more expensive than a physical connection.

**The “ALBA-1 cable”**

A Cuban-Venezuelan joint-venture (Telecomunicaciones Gran Caribe), owned by the state-run telecommunications companies of the two countries, is the entity that has moved the project forward. Responsibility for installing the line was held by Shanghai Bell, the Chinese subsidiary of the French firm Alcatel-Lucent. Shanghai Bell is experienced in the installation of lines having done this in many parts of the world.

Vice minister of Communications and Informatics Boris Moreno now says services could begin in September or October.

According to Jose Ignacio Quintero, the project manager for the installation, the cable will have a capacity of around 80 million simultaneous telephone calls, though part of that bandwidth will be for Internet service. In addition, it will have 640 gigabytes of capacity for connections abroad.

After the final connection, users will be able to “have access to international calls” to and from Cuba “without having to wait,” commented Quintero when the ship arrived with the fiber optic cable from Venezuela this past February.

The Cuban-American owned TeleCuba Company had previously proposed running a cable from Key West to the island — only 108 miles, and therefore cheaper than the Venezuelan connection — but Cuba did not respond to the offer.

The current cable had to travel almost ten times that distance (994 miles from Camuri Venezuela to Siboney Cuba) at a cost of more than US $70,000,000.

According to the Granma newspaper, “The blockade prevents Cuba from being connected to any one of nearly a dozen international connections that surround us. For example, one of these cables (Cancun-Miami) passes as close as only 20 miles from the Havana seawall.”

**Getting online in Cuba**

Notwithstanding the Cuban government’s attempt to socialize Internet service in state-run schools, workplaces, health, research and cultural facilities, sentiment on the island contradicts such aims. For many Cubans, the services offered are highly insufficient.

In the majority of the cases access to open Internet is conditioned by strict regulations that prohibit personal and creative use of available services.

In the opinion of blogger and activist Yasmin S. Portales, access to the Internet at government institutions is achieved through the “professional, educational or political contacts” of the user, as well as according to the “judgments of the directors of those centers relative to the social purpose of their terminals.” Under such controls, “those who access will be alienated from their freedom to navigate the web a priori, limited by the standards of political/moral correctness of its network’s administrator,” stressed Portales.

Generally, the regulations of computer security are applied in a discretionary manner, varying from ministry to ministry. Nor are the standards of censorship uniform.

Optometry technician Jimmy Roque Martinez explained that in the last few weeks, instead of increasing the navigational speed and accessibility of the Infomed network, which belongs to the Cuban Ministry of Health, these capacities have declined. Roque, who is also an activist member of the Critical Observatory, reports that when using his personal Infomed account he can no longer even access certain national websites such as Granma, Juventud Rebelde or Trabajadores newspapers.

Nevertheless, he checked to find that it’s still possible to access these sites from institutional health system connections.

One source (who wished not to be identified) told HT that the Youth Computer Club they attend in an eastern province generally offers very limited connection time and without the ability to log onto Facebook. However, if a user declares that they intend to “speak well of the Cuban Revolution and the Cuban Five” on some website — including Facebook — they are granted limitless time.

Cultural institutions seem to be those that offer services (free as well as at moderate rates) to the greatest number of people. The Cubarte network accommodates many institutions and national creators by offering a range of payment plans. As part of their missions, several of these institutions offer Internet surfing services to their users, but with the aforementioned limitations.

**Yes, but no**

At the end of 2008, computerization process official Carlos Oporto explained that Cuba’s strategy was related to an “orderly and intensive social use of the media and connectivity.” This was stated in a workshop where another official of the Telecommunications & Informatics Ministry — when referring to the Internet — revealed that “We don’t have the infrastructure for this.”

It’s been almost three years and yet they still don’t seem prepared.

Before the International Relations Commission of the Cuban National Assembly, Bruno Moreno just pointed out to the deputies: “The Cuba-Venezuela cable is just short of going into operation, and now it’s necessary to begin transferring the channels, which implies sitting down with the service providers and beginning to transfer services in September or October.”

The Granma newspaper, as well as the rest of the printed Cuban press, has omitted all information related to the Internet. According to Yohandry Fontana’s blog, the vice minister emphasized that the responsible position for Cuba is that in this context of financial limitations, blockade and aggression, “We will continue improving access where it’s necessary for the country’s development.”

Months ago, Granma, the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party had already made it clear that, “The underwater cable will provide greater quality in info-communication, but this will not necessarily mean an expansion of these services. The socialization of service will depend more on seeking efficiency than on the amplification of the network.”

During his presentation last week to the parliament committee, Boris Moreno commented that, “The political will exists for expanding the services of the Internet to the degree that economic resources allow the development of the infrastructure necessary for it, because the massive entry onto the Internet requires significant investments for that to be progressively carried out, and that depends on the number of users to serve. Access for personal use will be offered to the degree that the capacity allows this.”

Back in 2008 Carlos Oporto stated that fiber optics already existed internally in Cuba, so it was only a question of waiting a few years for the authorities responsible to prepare the necessary infrastructure. But because the recent statements by vice minister Moreno were not made public, we don’t know how much work has still yet to be carried out, or whether he even told the deputies.

Contradicting Waldo Reboredo, the vice-president of Telecomunicaciones Gran Caribe, who had stated months earlier that the fiber optic cable “would reduce the costs of current operations by 25 percent,” Moreno told the National Assembly committee that “this investment will guarantee safer access and will improve the quality of the connections, but it won’t mean a reduction in the costs that Cuba pays for Internet access.”

For the moment, the public’s expectations are yet to be fulfilled. The privileged few who have their slow connections to the Internet are waiting anxiously for a change. Will Cubans be able to contract for Internet services in their homes? Will the price for the service be reduced at tourist centers? Will speed improve for everyone? Will they reduce the charges for telephone services?

Residents on the remote South Atlantic territory of St Helena have renewed their plea for the UK to back plans to bring broadband to the island. The British Overseas Territory needs £10m to connect to a submarine cable.

The island's 4,200 residents currently rely on a slow satellite connection, which campaigners say is stunting the island's growth.

The Foreign Office has said a ""full economic assessment"" was needed before any new link could be funded.

Campaign group A Human Right, supported by the UN, has called on the Department for International Development to contribute substantially to the engineering costs of connecting the island to the South Atlantic Express, a new superfast fibre optic cable being laid by South African firm eFive.

Dr Rosalind Thomas, eFive's chief executive, agreed last year to alter the cable's path to bring it closer to the island, opening up the prospect of connecting it. An investment of around £10m, campaigners said, would be enough to latch on to the cable and ""revolutionise"" the island.

Google is making a big bet on market growth in South Africa and potentially other countries on the African continent.  
The company announced Friday that it is funding construction of its own new submarine cable that will connect Lisbon to Cape Town. Running along Africa’s west coast, the cable is designed to make it possible in the future to add branches along its length that land in other points along the coast. The first such branch has already been decided and will land in Lagos, Nigeria.  
While Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet, has funded 13 submarine-cable construction projects over the years, this is only the third time the company is paying for an entire cable on its own. Most of its investments have been as part of consortia that typically get together to fund this kind of infrastructure.  
The consortia have traditionally consisted of telecommunications companies and governments, but in recent years started to sometimes include tech giants that operate global cloud platforms, such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon. The tech companies invest in cables to ensure they not only have enough transcontinental bandwidth in their network backbones but also redundant paths to route traffic around downed connections.  
Google funding it alone means the Equiano system – named after the Nigerian-born writer and abolitionist Olaudah Equiano – will be built faster. It also means Google will have the cable’s bandwidth all to itself if needed. The company said the system will provide about 20 times more capacity than the last one built to serve the region.  
Alcatel Submarine Networks will build the cable, whose first phase, connecting South Africa to Portugal, is expected to be finished in 2021.  
According to Google, Equiano will also be the first subsea cable capable of ""optical switching at the fiber-pair level"" instead of ""traditional wavelength-level switching."" This technology will allow Google to add and reallocate capacity in different parts of the system as needed.  
Google didn’t say how much it was expecting to spend on the project, but submarine-cable builds of this scale typically cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Treating investment in its global infrastructure as a way to gain advantage over competitors, Google said it has spent $47 billion on data centers and network infrastructure just in the last three years, stepping up efforts to win public-cloud market share from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and others.  
Its cloud services already seem to enjoy widespread use in South Africa, but it has yet to build a data center there. Earlier this year Microsoft, which is also already a major cloud player in the market, became the first of international cloud giants to launch data centers in the country; Amazon Web Services expects to launch cloud facilities there next year.  
Commenting on Microsoft and Amazon’s activity, Jon Tullett, a Johannesburg-based IDC analyst, told Quartz that public cloud could become a “billion-dollar market” in South Africa. He also said there was currently a “short-term acceleration in growth” in cloud and related services there and in other countries on the continent.  
Illustrating just how much the market for digital services in South Africa is expected to pick up in the near future is the amount of submarine-cable building activity taking place there.  
Google’s Equiano isn’t the only new submarine cable that will land in the country over the next several years. Six cables land in South Africa today, and six more are expected to come online over the next three years, not including Google’s system. Three of the cables in progress will land in Cape Town. (None currently land in the city, although two land not far up the coast.) The six new systems will expand the region’s connectivity to North America, South America, Europe, Middle East, and Asia.","The article discusses Google's funding of a new submarine cable, the Equiano, which connects Lisbon to Cape Town and is designed to enhance internet connectivity in Africa.

It mentions the cable's capacity and implications for regional telecommunications, indicating that cut sea cables are a central theme.

Some believe it's by looking up to the heavens.

Not in hope of divine intervention, but as an opportunity: satellite-powered broadband could be the answer to Africa's connectivity conundrum.

The internet is, as one US senator once put it, a series of tubes.

His comments went down in internet folklore and were roundly mocked - but his remarks were loosely true. For the internet to get around the world it needs cables - lots of them.

They cost millions, span entire oceans and meander across deserts. Many are laid through some of the world's most volatile areas, such as Syria.

So when it comes to connecting Africa to the high-speed information super-highway, the enormity of the task cannot be over-exaggerated.

In the past few years, the continent has benefited from major investment into its internet economy.

Since 2009, three high-speed internet cables have been laid across the ocean, reaching out from Europe and Asia, and bringing huge speed increases - not to mention lower costs - to east Africa.

Kenya has arguably made the most of this connectivity. In just 12 months after the installation of the high-speed cables, the number of Kenyans on broadband rocketed from 1.8 million to more than 3 million.

With a lot of businesses now able to set themselves up and serve customers online, savings were able to be made across the board.

But cables are expensive - and they break. Earlier this year, cables linking east Africa to the Middle East and Europe were severed in an accident.

Internet users' connectivity suffered for more than three weeks - with data transfer rates in nine countries taking a serious, crippling hit. Such long-term technical problems undermine Africa's credibility as a potential future global technology hub.

Coupled with the logistical barrier associated with enabling internet connections in the most rural parts of Africa, and it's arguable that a rethink is desperately needed.

Avanti's rethink launched into space on 2 August.

The company says its satellite, Hylas 2, will bring high speed connectivity to southern and eastern Africa, the Middle East and the central Asia.

The growth potential for businesses on the ground, Avanti chief executive David Williams says, is simply enormous.

""We have always believed there is a huge opportunity for satellite communications services in emerging markets because growth for data and voice services is high whilst supply of telecoms network capacity is low,"" Mr Williams says.

""This is very attractive to Government and enterprise customers, particularly those working in oil, mining, agriculture, banking and security sectors.""

The satellite is the company's second to reach orbit. The first, Hylas 1, went up in 2010, and the company plans another - Hylas 3 - for 2015.

Hylas is shorthand for ""Highly Adaptable Satellite"", an apt name which describes one of its key attributes - the ability to direct its beams to different areas of the continent in order to satisfy demand.

All of the satellites utilise the Ka-band frequency, which operates in the 30Ghz section of the radio spectrum. Avanti says this means it is able to offer 99.9% uptime, no matter what the weather conditions may be.

It is hoped that the satellites build on the progress brought by the undersea cables and lower the cost of broadband further, be it residential users or those running a business.

Although costs have become far cheaper since cable installations, broadband is still prohibitively expensive.

For example, in Kenya, a small business broadband connection can cost around £60 a month for a relatively slow connection of 256kb per second.

With the new satellites, Avanti says it can offer 8MB connection speeds for around £20 - a dramatic rise in speed coupled with what some believe is a game-changing drop in price.

""Whatever the investments that you see happening, they will [all] make the internet cheaper,"" says Paul Kukubo, chief executive of the Kenyan ICT board.

""The internet is getting cheaper anyway,"" he tells the BBC.

""It's getting cheaper on two accounts - investments and also the economies of scale.

""As more people get connected, it's more effective financially to actually invest and therefore the internet gets cheaper.""

He argued that lessons can be learned from the mobile networks who, with enhanced technology, were able to offer individuals and businesses attractively-priced internet connectivity, even in rural areas.

As a result, Africa has in fact left the developed world in its wake when it comes to adopting breakthrough mobile technologies - particularly mobile payments such as the hugely popular M-Pesa system.

In Angola, this kind of mobile connectivity is being taken to the next level. In partnership with Chinese telecoms firm ZTE, the country is rolling out 4G mobile infrastructure.

It means Angola, which just over 10 years ago was in the grip of a civil war, will offer its citizens better and faster mobile coverage than is currently on offer in London. Other countries, like Namibia, are attempting to follow suit.

Africa's surge in mobile internet use can be repeated in the fixed broadband world, Mr Kukubo says.

""We've got good examples of people who have made money by providing connectivity to the rural communities,"" he said.

""The large telephone networks have priced their products in a way that allows people to access it through cellphones.""

He believes that by encouraging more businesses to adopt broadband services, the knock-on effect will see a significant change in costs as prices are lowered across the board.

""As consumers [learn] what to do online, you get greater usage, and that usage also drives the prices down, and also drives greater business applications, greater consumer applications.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, including their importance for internet connectivity in Africa and specific incidents where cables were severed, leading to significant connectivity issues.

Kenya's Finance Minister Uhuru Kenyatta cut the 16% VAT on new phone handsets. He also allowed internet providers to offset the cost of purchasing new fibre optic bandwidth for 20 years. 

The first of three submarine cables connecting Mombasa port to Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates has been inaugurated by the president. Kenyans rely on slow and expensive satellite connections to the internet, but will not benefit from high-speed access until all three of The East African Marine Systems (Teams) cables are in place. 

The project is a joint venture between the Kenyan government, Emirates Telecommunication Technology and a consortium of local investors. It costs one Kenyan shilling (one cent) a minute to surf the net in internet cafes in the capital, Nairobi.

A severed marine cable has left Somalia without internet for weeks, triggering losses for businesses, residents said, and adding a layer of chaos in a country where militant insurgents are carrying out a campaign of bombings and killings.

Abdi Anshuur, Somalia's minister for posts and telecommunications, told state radio that internet to the Horn of Africa state went down a month ago after a ship cut an undersea cable connecting it to global data networks.

Businesses have had to close or improvise to remain open and university students told Reuters their educational courses had been disrupted.

Anshuur said the outage was costing Somalia the equivalent of about $10 million in economic output.

""The night internet went off marked the end of my daily bread,"" Mohamed Nur, 22, told Reuters in the capital Mogadishu.

Nur said he now begged ""tea and cigarettes from friends"" after the internet cutoff also severed his monthly income of $500 that he took in from ads he developed and placed on the video website, YouTube.

Somalia's economy is still picking up slowly after a combined force of the army and an African Union peacekeeping force helped drive the militant group, al Shabaab, out of Mogadishu and other strongholds.

The group remains formidable and lethal, with its campaign of frequent bombings and killings a key source of significant security risk for most businesses and regular life.

Now the internet outage potentially compounds the hardships for most firms. Most young people who say they are unable to work because of the outage spend hours idling in front of tea shops.

Mohamed Ahmed Hared, commercial manager of Somali Optical Networks(SOON), a large internet service provider in the country, told Reuters his business was losing over a million dollars a day.

Hared's clients, he said, had reported a range of crippled services including passport and e-tickets printing and money remittances.

Some students and staff at the University of Somalia in Mogadishu told Reuters their learning had been disrupted because Google, which they heavily rely on for research, was now inaccessible.

The absence of especially popular internet sites like Facebook and YouTube and Google was, however, cause for celebration for some in the conservative, Muslim nation.

""My wife used to be (on) YouTube or Facebook every minute,"" Mohamud Osman, 45, said, adding the online activity would sometimes distract her from feeding her baby and that the habit had once forced him to try to get a divorce.

Widespread outages were reported on Thursday in countries including South Africa, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Benin, Ghana and Burkina Faso. Since then, services have largely been restored in Liberia and South Africa.

The cause of the cable failures was not immediately clear, to the frustration of millions of customers around the continent.

""There seems to be a pattern in the timing of the disruptions, impacting from the north to the south of Africa,"" said Cloudflare Radar, which provides information on internet connections.

The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), which regulates the telecoms industry, said the outage was caused by damage to international undersea cables running along the West African coastline.

""The cuts occurred somewhere in Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal, with an attendant disruption in Portugal,"" said NCC spokesman Reuben Muoka.

Sometimes undersea cables can get cut, even by debris, a retired expert told the BBC. He added: ""You can also have undersea earth slides - sections of seabed can become unstable, sending huge amounts of mud down a canyon or gulley.""

""Where cables come ashore and are buried underground, they could be prone to accidental or intentional damage.""

Whatever the cause, it has resulted in major difficulties for people who rely on the internet for a living.

""It's been impossible to communicate with my clients - I also needed to organise a delivery though an online app,"" fashion designer Cheick Senou told the BBC on Friday from Abidjan in Ivory Coast. ""I couldn't do anything without the internet.""

Internet connectivity in the Ivory Coast was down to around just 4% on Thursday morning, according to Netblocks, which tracks cybersecurity and internet connectivity. Liberia at one point dropped to 17% while Benin was at 14% and Ghana 25%, Netblocks said.

In South Africa, Vodacom on Thursday said that customers were ""experiencing intermittent connectivity issues due to multiple undersea cable failures"". A fault was also reported on the MainOne cable system which serves Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos.

The Liberian government confirmed on Thursday that internet disruption had been reported from that morning. Citizens were unable to access the basic internet as well as social media across the vast majority of the country. International bank transfers were also reported to be affected while there were limited international voice calls.

""It seems like 50% of my life is gone today,"" Benjamin Garkpah told the BBC from the Liberian capital, Monrovia, on Thursday.

Fatumata Barry said her business had stalled because she couldn't receive payments through mobile money.

The Liberia Telecommunications Authority said it was caused by an incident involving the Africa Coast to Europe (ACE) submarine communications cable in Ivory Coast.

In Ghana, the National Communications Authority (NCA) reported that multiple undersea cable disruptions were responsible for the outage.

From all indications, the origin of this problem is neither the frequent rains nor the intermittent power supply. But it can mostly be traced back outside Africa and to one company -- MainOne.

For those who may not know, MainOne is a Nigeria-based internet and telecoms solution provider. Founded in 2009, the company achieved the ""impossible"" in 2010 when it successfully ran a 14,000km submarine cable from Portugal to South Africa.

But it's not just the internet providers that are affected. Beyond being an internet service wholesaler, MainOne also offers co-location services for big enterprises including banks in Nigeria. 

In other words, you will have to wait a bit longer before everything is back to normal. Meanwhile, if you've started experiencing passable internet service of late, it's because many of these same providers that are dependent on MainOne have alternatives. 

This is a developing story. We will serve you additional official statements from MainOne as they come in.

**UPDATE 1**: We received an updated statement from MainOne that pins the fault to somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean and gives an estimated repair time of 14 days.

The cable will transform communications in Cuba, which has among the slowest internet speeds in the world.  

The new connection will make download speeds 3,000 times faster - at least for the small minority of Cubans who have internet access.  

It should also make international phone calls much cheaper.  

The 1,600km (1,000 mile) cable from Venezuela was financed by the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (Alba) - a left-wing regional grouping founded by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.  

Cuban Information and Communications Minister Medardo Diaz said it ""reinforced Cuba's sovereignty"" and ""opened a breach"" in the US economic blockade.  

The cable would ""be at the service of our people, as a tool to reinforce its development, integration and sovereignty"" when it became operational in July, he added.  

Until now, Cuba has relied on internet and international telephone connections via satellite, which is expensive and slow.  

Cuba's communist government has always blamed its poor communications links with the outside world on the decades-old US trade embargo, which has prevented the installation of a fibre optic cable to Florida, just 144km away.  

**Broader access?**  

The arrival of the fibre-optic cable has raised enormous expectations in Cuba, says the BBC's Fernando Ravsberg in Havana.  

According to official Cuban statistics, only 3% of the population have access to the web - the lowest figure in the western hemisphere.  

Access is restricted and available only with government permission - although since 2009 Cubans have been able to use internet cafes, mostly in hotels, and there is a strong black market for internet connections.  

Last November the official Communist Party newspaper, Granma, sought to lower expectations.  

""The underwater cable will provide higher quality communications, but not necessarily mean a broader extension of the same,"" it said.  

The Cuban government says there is no ""political obstacle"" to the internet in Cuba.

This is very expensive and is one of the big obstacles to growth,"" says Ms Mugo. The price of satellite bandwidth is prohibitively high in Kenya and other East African countries. A megabyte of satellite-delivered bandwidth in Kenya costs around $7,500, whereas elsewhere in the world a megabyte costs no more than about $400.  

In the next few days, the Kenyan government will sign a deal with Alcatel-Lucent to commission a fibre-optic cable from Fujaira in The United Arab Emirates down the East African coast to Mombasa. This will be welcomed in the Browse Internet Access cafe in Nairobi, where many are frustrated by slow, costly web access.  

Sami Seram, a student, finds doing online research very slow going. In a country where the average annual wage is less than $1,500, he spends about 500 Kenyan shillings a week on internet connections.  

Stephen Onyambu, the boss of Browse, says the high cost of satellite bandwidth makes it impossible to offer cheaper internet access. But once the fibre optic comes, he expects to charge just a few cents for internet time.  

Work on laying the fibre-optic cable is due to start at the end of the year in an $82m operation, with Alcatel-Lucent committing to finish the project in two years. Bitange Ndemo from the Kenyan Ministry of Communication states that this will bring a massive change, especially to rural areas, where many villages will gain access to electricity and the internet for the first time.  

It is an enticing prospect, but realistically, it will still be a long time before Kenya is all hooked up to the worldwide web.","The article discusses the commissioning of a fibre-optic cable running from Fujaira in the UAE to Mombasa, Kenya, which is a direct reference to undersea cables.

REUTERS/Feisal Omar  

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - A severed marine cable has left Somalia without internet for weeks, triggering losses for businesses, residents said, and adding a layer of chaos in a country where Islamist insurgents are carrying out a campaign of bombings and killings.  

Abdi Anshuur, Somalia's minister for posts and telecommunications, told state radio that internet to the Horn of Africa state went down a month ago after a ship cut an undersea cable connecting it to global data networks.  

Businesses have had to close or improvise to remain open and university students told Reuters their educational courses had been disrupted.  

Anshuur said the outage was costing Somalia the equivalent of about $10 million in economic output.  

""The night internet went off marked the end of my daily bread,"" Mohamed Nur, 22, told Reuters in the capital Mogadishu.  

Nur said he now begged ""tea and cigarettes from friends"" after the internet cutoff also severed his monthly income of $500 that he took in from ads he developed and placed on the video website, YouTube.  

Somalia's economy is still picking up slowly after a combined force of the army and an African Union peacekeeping force helped drive the Islamist group, al Shabaab, out of Mogadishu and other strongholds.  

Al Shabaab wants to topple the western backed government and rule according to its strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law.  

The group remains formidable and lethal, with its campaign of frequent bombings and killings a key source of significant security risk for most businesses and regular life.  

Now the internet outage potentially compounds the hardships for most firms. Most young people who say they are unable to work because of the outage spend hours idling in front of tea shops.  

Mohamed Ahmed Hared, commercial manager of Somali Optical Networks(SOON), a large internet service provider in the country, told Reuters his business was losing over a million dollars a day.  

Hared's clients, he said, had reported a range of crippled services including passport and e-tickets printing and money remittances.  

Some students and staff at the University of Somalia in Mogadishu told Reuters their learning had been disrupted because google, which they heavily rely on for research, was now inaccessible.  

The absence of especially popular internet sites like Facebook and YouTube and Google was, however, cause for celebration for some in the conservative, Muslim nation.  

""My wife used to be (on) YouTube or Facebook every minute,"" Mohamud Osman, 45, said, adding the online activity would sometimes distract her from feeding her baby and that the habit had once forced him to try to get a divorce.  

""Now I am happy ... internet is without doubt a necessary tool of evil.""

On Thursday, subsea cable providers were affected by major cuts to undersea submarine cables, disrupting internet traffic in major parts of the continent.

This disrupted the **[services of banks and telecommunications companies](https://www.thecable.ng/nigerian-banks-mtn-affected-by-damaged-submarine-cables-in-west-africa)** in Nigeria.

In a statement on Friday, MainOne said an additional two to three weeks of transit time may be required for a vessel to pick up the spares of submarine cables and travel from Europe to West Africa.

Speaking on the cause of the network outage, MainOne said preliminary findings and further investigations showed “the fault occurred due to an external incident that resulted in a cut on its submarine cable system, in the Atlantic Ocean offshore Cote D’Ivoire, along the coast of West Africa”.

“We have a maintenance agreement with Atlantic Cable Maintenance and Repair Agreement (ACMA) to provide repair services for the submarine cable,” the company said.

“First identify and assign a vessel, the vessel has to retrieve the necessary spares required for repair, and then sail to the fault location to conduct the repair work.

“Next, in order to complete the repair, the affected section of the submarine cable will have to be pulled from the seabed onto the ship where it will be spliced by skilled technicians.”

According to MainOne, after repair, joints will be inspected and tested for any defects and subsequently, the submarine cable will be lowered back to the seabed and placed in a good position.

“This process might take 1-2 weeks for repairs while about 2-3 weeks of transit time may be required for the vessel to pick up the spares and travel from Europe to West Africa once the vessel is mobilised,” MainOne said.

In another update on Friday, the company said it is working with cable systems not affected by the incident or previous outages to secure restoration capacity.

MainOne said its technical team is working assiduously to restore services, subject to availability of capacity and service configuration specifics.

“We will also provide incremental updates on the root cause and efforts to repair the submarine cable as soon as those details become available,” the company said.

According to the statement, it is also collaborating with partners to mitigate the impact of the damage by rerouting traffic and enabling more circuits.

“ACE and WACS have jointly initiated the repair process by mobilising a cable ship for a collaborative repair effort. While investigation and repair efforts are underway, Bayobab’s strategy focuses on successfully rerouting traffic, leveraging our extensive network, and collaborating with industry partners,” the telco said.

“Our network resiliency allows for the swift activation of new cables, facilitating faster rerouting and bolstering network resilience. By activating new cables, we quickly increase interconnectivity and establish alternative routes.

“Additionally, we are working with the cable consortiums and partners to enhance interconnection along both the west and east coasts, with further interconnections between WACS and Equiano, and the introduction of the end-to-end connection between WACS on the west coast and EASSy on the east coast.”

MTN said it has already made progress in restoring service in some affected regions, assuring it remains committed to achieving full recovery as swiftly as possible.","The article titled 'Internet disruption: Undersea cable repair might take two weeks, says MainOne' discusses the recent cuts to undersea cables, specifically stating that four subsea cables were cut, which disrupted internet services in major parts of West Africa.

Johannesburg, 08 Aug 2023  

The WACS and SAT-3 undersea cables snapped simultaneously.  

South African fibre infrastructure providers are taking action to resolve disruptions in internet connectivity services, following a break in two undersea cables this week.  

The West Africa Cable System (WACS) and SAT-3 undersea cables snapped simultaneously on Sunday, impacting local fibre players, infrastructure provider Openserve and Broadband Infraco, among others.  

In a statement, Openserve says the impact on its network is limited to customers on the international private leased circuit services.  

“Openserve can confirm the breaks of the WACS and SAT-3 undersea cables. We are collaborating with the consortium partners to facilitate the restoration of these cables.  

“The Openserve network remains robust due to our investment in other international cable capacity, hence all Openserve IP Transit services traffic has been automatically re-routed, ensuring our customers stay seamlessly connected.”  

According to Openserve, no official restoration timeline has been communicated by the consortium.  

In a tweet, state-owned wholesale infrastructure provider Broadband Infraco apologised to customers for the connectivity interruptions caused by the cable issues.  

“A WACS cable break has occurred in the subsea nearby DRC Congo Canyon. The break is confirmed at approximately 3 686km from Yzerfontein cable landing station. For more info, please contact +2711 239 8020 or opssupport@infraco.co.za,” says the company in the tweet.  

The WACS and SAT-3 cable systems are deployed in the Atlantic Ocean, and connect SA and many other African countries to Europe.  

The WACS system lands in SA at Yzerfontein, Western Cape, while the SAT-3/WACS system enters the country at Melkbosstrand, Western Cape.  

The WACS cable consists of four fibre pairs and is 14 530km in length, linking from Yzerfontein in the Western Cape of SA, to London in the UK.  

Operators of the WACS and SAT-3 had not responded to ITWeb’s queries by the time of publication.","The article provides a comprehensive discussion on the breaking of the WACS and SAT-3 undersea cables, detailing the impact on internet connectivity in South Africa.

On Sunday, May 12, issues with the EASSy and Seacom submarine cables again disrupted connectivity to East Africa, impacting countries previously affected by cable cuts nearly three months earlier.

On February 24, three submarine cables that run through the Red Sea were damaged: the Seacom/Tata cable, the Asia Africa Europe-1 (AAE-1), and the Europe India Gateway (EIG). It is believed that the cables were cut by the anchor of the Rubymar, a cargo ship damaged by a missile on February 18. These cable cuts impacted countries including Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and Mozambique. As of May 13, these cables remain unrepaired.

Suffering reduced capacity due to the February cable cuts, these countries faced a second set of cable cuts on May 12. According to Ben Roberts from Liquid Intelligent Technologies, faults on the EASSy and Seacom cables again disrupted connectivity, stating, ""All sub sea capacity between East Africa and South Africa is down."" The EASSy cable had been cut approximately 45km north of Durban, South Africa.

Cloudflare Radar observed traffic levels drop across the impacted countries before 11:00 local time on May 12. Traffic initially dropped by 10-25% in Kenya, Uganda, Madagascar, and Mozambique, while Rwanda, Malawi, and Tanzania saw drops of one-third or more.

In response, providers like Safaricom and Airtel Kenya activated redundancy measures to minimize service interruption. The Communications Authority of Kenya directed service providers to secure alternative routes for their traffic.

Once necessary permits are secured and cable faults located, repairs can often be completed in several days. However, delays may occur due to the scarcity of cable repair ships.

""My aim is to put Kenya on the world map,"" says the quietly spoken software king of East Africa.

""Companies like Facebook, Yahoo and Google don't have to just come from the US - they can also come from Kenya.""

Kamal Budhabhatti, CEO of Craft Silicon, is the closest the country has to a Bill Gates. His firm - Craft Silicon - is responsible for more than 90% of the country's software exports.

The business - which produces electronic payment and banking software - is still a minnow compared to its Silicon Valley cousins. It has just 200 employees and a turnover of around $15m.

""We still feel that we are a very small company compared to the international software houses - we have a long way to go,"" he says.

But Mr Budhabhatti's ambition is a sign that Kenya's tech scene is maturing and wanting to establish a global reputation.

He is one of a growing number of entrepreneurs in the region who are helping establish Kenya as East Africa's hi-tech hub.

""We are getting to a point now, that if you want to be involved in tech in East Africa then you have to come to Nairobi,"" said Erik Hersman, co-founder of the crowdsourcing software Ushahidi, based in the city.

Nairobi has long been a trading hub and a source of wealth in East Africa, based around traditional industries. But over the last decade it has begun to transform itself into a digital hub, home to a large number of tech firms - including Google, IBM and Nokia.

The arrival of three undersea internet cables in June 2009 has been a major reason for the confidence boost in the Nairobi tech sector and in East Africa in general. They have changed perceptions about what is possible in the country, spurring demand for services.

Local content is increasingly sought after, with many services focusing on the agricultural sector and mobile technology, tailored to the cultural nuances of Kenya.

The iHub, a co-working space in Nairobi, has become a focal point for entrepreneurs and developers, attracting local and foreign investors.

Despite the excitement, caution is advised; sustainability is key to the future success of the tech scene in Kenya. Mr Budhabhatti emphasizes the importance of practical and sustainable solutions in the tech industry.

"Severed Internet Cables and Africa’s Vulnerability","Examines the economic impact of severed undersea cables affecting internet services in West Africa, highlighting incidents of damage and their implications for connectivity in multiple countries.","https://african.business/2024/03/technology-information/severed-internet-cables-highlight-africas-vulnerability","2024-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","Ben Payton",Yes,"Ben Payton","London, United Kingdom","12000","2024-03-19","English","IC Publications","Several countries in West Africa have been grappling with large-scale internet outages since last Thursday, following damage to several undersea fibre-optic cables. Côte d’Ivoire, Senegal, Nigeria and Ghana are among the worst-affected, although internet users as far away as South Africa have also been hit.

The incident coincides with a spate of apparent sabotage incidents affecting cables on the opposite side of the continent. Yemen-based Houthi rebels are suspected of severing undersea fibre-optic cables in the Red Sea late last month, affecting internet traffic between East Africa, Asia and Europe. The Houthi denied targeting cables; and it was later reported that they were damaged by an anchor from the Rubymar, which the Houthi had sunk in their attacks on shipping.

The cause of the damage to the West African cables has not been confirmed. Several different cables are affected, including the West Africa Cable System (WACS), the Africa Coast to Europe (ACE), MainOne, and SAT3.

MainOne, a Nigerian telecom services and network solutions firm, said in a statement that the disruption was “most probably due to environmental factors such as landslides and earthquakes”. It claimed that it could rule out any kind of “human activity” as a cause of the fault, since at the point at which the damage occurred the cable lies 3km deep on the seabed.

“International services on our cable south of the landing in Senegal have been disrupted. This has resulted in the outage of internet services for a majority of our customers. We recognize the impact of the outage and are working tirelessly to make available restoration capacity for temporary relief, where feasible,” the firm added.

Economic impacts from the outage are likely to be considerable. Banks were forced to close in several countries, including Nigeria, as they were unable to process transactions. Mobile internet users across the region have also reported slow connection speeds, with knock-on impacts for mobile money providers.

Preliminary estimates suggest that fully repairing the damage will take around five weeks, taking into account the two weeks needed for repair vessels to reach the area where the cables have been severed.

**Fragile cables leave Africa vulnerable**

Undersea telecommunication cables play a critical role in the global economy. Improvements in fibre-optic cable connections across Africa over the last decade have helped internet-based businesses flourish, enabling the growth of tech ecosystems in many countries.

However, these connections are extremely fragile and damage to cables is relatively common. As well as deliberate sabotage, cables can be severed by undersea earthquakes, landslides or volcanic eruptions. Ships dragging their anchors along the seabed are another common culprit for faults. Even shark bites can cause serious damage.

To varying degrees, African countries are particularly vulnerable due to the relatively low density of cable connections to many countries. Several major cable systems extend around large sections of the African continent – for example Google’s Equiano cable, which runs from Portugal to South Africa and was completed in 2022 – but most of these systems have spurs that create “landing points” in only a handful of countries.

Sierra Leone, Liberia and Mauritania, for example, are each connected by a single cable, meaning that any damage can cause a total internet blackout. South Africa, on the other hand, has multiple connections, so that telecom operators can reroute traffic onto other cables in the event of an outage.

Telecoms operator MTN said in a statement that it was making progress in restoring services in West Africa and, in the longer term, is seeking to improve the resilience of its networks.

“We are working with the cable consortiums and partners to enhance interconnection along both the west and east coasts, with further interconnections between WACS and Equiano, and the introduction of the end-to-end connection between WACS on the west coast and EASSy on the east coast,” it said.

An alternative to fibre-optic cables is to use satellites to deliver internet services. Satellite internet, however, generally delivers slower connections at great expense. Efforts to scale up this technology are still nascent. Elon Musk’s Starlink internet service, for example, is currently available in only a handful of African countries, including Eswatini, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda and Zambia.","The article titled ""Severed internet cables highlight Africa’s vulnerability"" directly discusses the damage to several undersea fibre-optic cables affecting internet connectivity in West Africa.

"Microsoft and Facebook's Record-Breaking Atlantic Cable","160 terabits per second capacity with implications for connectivity disruptions during events like Hurricane Sandy.","https://www.extremetech.com/computing/256394-microsoft-facebook-160-terabits-per-second-cable-atlantic","2017-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","",Yes,"Frank Rey","New York City, NY, USA",-,"2017-09-26","English","ExtremeTech","**Microsoft, Facebook Run Fastest-Ever Cable Underneath the Atlantic**  
Microsoft, Facebook, and Telxius have finished their joint effort to run a massive bandwidth pipe 4,100 miles across the Atlantic Ocean. The new cable can transmit 160 terabits per second (20TBps). That's rather a lot. The Marea cable is 17,000 feet below the surface of the ocean, at pressures that would crush the human body like a beer can.

The cable connects Virginia to Spain, from its starting point at Virginia Beach to Bilbao. The Marea is just one of the many cables that link the United States to the rest of the world, but it's now the fastest cable -- and it doesn't follow the same route as previous cables did. That's a deliberate choice that Microsoft made to limit the potential damage if one or more of the cables on the 'main' route was broken. These kind of breakages do happen, typically by accident, and they can leave significant parts of a country with either no Internet at all, or a very limited pipeline. The United States is arguably at less risk of being disrupted than some other countries, thanks to a plethora of connections and the fact that many domains and services are hosted domestically, rather than being accessed remotely, but we'd still feel the effects of any significant disruption. The Marea cable is partly meant to guard against that problem.

The impetus for the cable project was Hurricane Sandy, which hit the East Coast back in 2012. The storm and its associated storm surge did significant damage to computer networks, cell phone towers, and other infrastructure, particularly in New Jersey and New York City.

“It was a major disruption,” says Frank Rey, director of global network strategy for Microsoft’s Cloud Infrastructure and Operations division. “The entire network between North America and Europe was isolated for a number of hours. For us, the storm brought to light a potential challenge in the consolidation of transatlantic cables that all landed in New York and New Jersey.”

According to Brad Smith, president of Microsoft, the cable was also deployed to meet the growing need for bandwidth between the United States, Europe, and Africa. Cables between the US and Europe already carry 55 percent more traffic than US-Pacific links, and 40 percent more traffic than the links between the US and Latin America.

Microsoft's notes the cable is over 4,000 miles long, weighs 10.25 million pounds, and is the approximate weight of 34 blue whales. On the one hand, the blue whale is the heaviest and largest animal alive today, and may be the heaviest and largest animal to have lived. On the other, it's really odd to measure things with whales. Then again, we measure lots of things with Rhode Island, for reasons that have never been entirely clear.

Fun fact: According to Randall Munroe, a 747 at full thrust is powerful enough to balance the weight of a single blue whale. If a 747 can balance a blue whale, and Microsoft's Marea cable weighs as much as 34 blue whales, how many blue whales does it take to cover and/or sink Rhode Island? The answer would require calculating how much isostatic depression each whale would create per foot and how much weight it would take to sink the state. Topographic maps are probably a must. Bonus points for calculating Rhode Island's average height above sea level during the last ice age, when billions of tons of ice depressed continents all around the world.","The article discusses the Marea undersea cable and its implications for internet connectivity, particularly in relation to potential disruptions caused by cable breakages.

**Published Date:** 02/26/2024  

Alpheus Mangale, SEACOM's group CEO.  

Telecoms provider SEACOM suffered an outage on its subsea cable system over the weekend.  

The disruption is affecting the segment of the cable that runs from Mombasa (Kenya) to Zafarana (Egypt), SEACOM said in a statement.  

According to the company, although the outage has impacted some of its clients’ businesses across East and Southern Africa, SEACOM has “been working diligently to ensure the continuity of its services”.  

Initial assessments suggest that the disruption to the subsea cable occurred within the vicinity of the Red Sea, and other cables in the area also appear to have been impacted.  

The company said it was unable to confirm the cause of the disruption but was working to assess the feasibility of the repair in the region.  

“The location of the cable break is significant due to its geopolitical sensitivity and ongoing tensions, making it a challenging environment for maintenance and repair operations,” said the company.  

Nonetheless, SEACOM says it continues to carry traffic on its own cable between Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and South Africa, for both transmission and IP services.  

The statement reads: “All other IP-based services destined for Europe and other regions were automatically rerouted via SEACOM’s alternative routes on Equiano, PEACE and WACS cable systems and supported by its diverse terrestrial infrastructure, ensuring its clients remain operational with some latency in their internet communications.”  

SEACOM says it provided customers with a cautionary alert on 5 February that any disruptions to the cable system could be impacted by delays in repair operations, due to the instability of the area.  

“The team is currently working towards restoration timelines and will communicate these plans with our clients,” said the company.","The article discusses a significant outage of SEACOM's subsea cable system, specifically affecting the segment between Kenya and Egypt.

In March this year web users in Lebanon were shocked to learn the internet speed in their country ranked rock bottom in the world. It came in placed 186th - behind Zambia, Vanuatu and even war-ravaged countries like Iraq and Afghanistan.

The data, published by speedtest.net, spurred the country's online activists into action. Campaign groups like Ontornet ('Ontor' a play on the Arabic for 'wait') and Flip the Switch sprang up on Facebook, while Twitter became awash with real-time feedback on people's web experiences.

""A file that takes me 16 hrs to download in Lebanon is downloaded in 6 minutes in France!"" wrote @Joanna_2983. Another, @Lebanese_facts, quipped: ""Loading…loading..loading… *15 mins later* page failed to load.""

Online protests have gained widespread support from household consumers all the way up to big businesses. Sensing growing unrest, the Telecoms Minister Nicolas Sehnaoui took action pushing through a decree in September committing to increase the country's internet speeds by up to eight times - while reducing costs by more than two-thirds.

According to the government, this will be achieved by connecting to the high capacity fibre optic India-Middle East-Western Europe (IMEWE) submarine cable. The IMEWE cable had been available for use from December 2010, but had not been switched on because of a dispute between the Telecoms Ministry and Ogero, the government-owned telecoms company responsible for the cable's maintenance.

Imad Taraby is the chairman and chief executive of the data service provider Cedarcom, a company that buys internet bandwidth from the Telecoms Ministry and then sells it onto consumers. He says preferential treatment of government-owned suppliers is the real cause of Lebanon's slow internet.

""Investors fear investing into this sector,"" says Mr Taraby. ""Why? Because we have one-year licences and competition is unfair. We pay so much high taxes up to 59% while government operators don't pay any tax and that doesn't allow [us] to compete fairly.""

Mark Daou works in advertising and PR, and also runs the Fast Lebanon Facebook campaign group. ""Basically it's waiting, waiting, waiting and if you're still not bored you wait a little bit more,"" he says.

Samer Karam is the director of Seeqnce, a start-up accelerator which helps small web companies by sharing knowledge and aggregating office facilities. ""From what I've seen the creative industry, in its creativity, hasn't been stifled,"" says Mr Karam.

Since the issuing of the government's decree, social media sites have been abuzz with speculation about when the internet will speed up. According to Mr Abi-Nassif speeds will pick up as the country moves toward a full 3G wireless internet service by early November. This week the country's The Daily Star newspaper published research that found that of 550 people surveyed, 68% said their internet connection was ""slow and nothing had changed"" since the beginning of October, the month the government said that faster speeds would be passed onto consumers.","The article discusses the IMEWE submarine cable, which is directly related to the topic of cut sea cables.

Hormuud Telecom, the country’s largest telecom company, announced the restoration of service in a message to subscribers.

The loss of internet service sparked anger across Somalia and affected the central and southern parts of the country including the capital, Mogadishu. The government called it a “major disaster.”

Officials and internet providers attributed the problem to a commercial ship that they said cut an undersea cable.

Major companies reported millions of dollars in revenue losses. University studies were disrupted.

The internet outage also complicated efforts to combat a nationwide drought that has half of the country’s 12 million people in need of assistance.

Prenesh Padayachee, Seacom group chief digital officer, was more forthcoming with information and took the opportunity to give an update on the Red Sea situation.

### What are the effects of the recent cable breakages on Seacom clients?
Our clients are fortunate to have built-in redundancy. Their IP traffic is automatically rerouted, meaning the break is mostly transparent to the end-user barring a potential slight increase in latency.

### How does the company manage to stay ahead of competing service providers?
We invest in infrastructure upfront and were the first to go live on Equiano cable and actively participate in new cable projects. The company also builds in multiple redundancy layers, both for the subsea network and within national terrestrial networks.

### Can you offer guarantees to clients during disruptions, especially as redundancy is now more strained and prices rise?
We are fortunate to not need to manually reconfigure its network, as traffic automatically reroutes to the next available path. This is a key differentiator. While some providers – specifically the high bandwidth hyperscalers – with capacity mapped to specific cables see performance suffer, we maintain reliable service for clients. We saw this happen with the Microsoft clients who couldn’t access teams.

### What are the contingency plans employed when routing is disrupted?
The main principle is upfront investment in multiple cable systems and terrestrial redundancy. We use dual routing for traffic that needs to head to Eastern or Western Europe and use the geographically appropriate cable to follow the shortest possible routes and optimise use around load shedding schedules (in South Africa specifically) to further protect their network.

### Do you have any advice for businesses choosing ISPs to mitigate these kinds of outages?
If the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Look at a potential ISP's infrastructure and ask:  
• Who provides their international capacity?  
• Which cable networks do they have access to?  
• Does traffic automatically reroute in case of an outage?

Unknown fault specifics

Padayachee also explained that, while this is one of the worst disruptions he has seen, he was joking with colleagues that they have seen this movie before.

Regarding the Red Sea outage, the suspicion is anchor drag damage and not vandalism that has been reported – and he could see the same issues happening on the west coast of the continent.

Red Sea repair teams are still getting permits in an increasingly fluid geopolitical zone.

Wacs and the other cables – Sat-3, Ace and MainOne – were cut in a suspected subsea seismic event near Ivory Coast on 14 March, causing internet chaos across the region, including as far south as South Africa.

Much of the traffic was, however, quickly rerouted along other cables, including Google’s recently launched Equiano system between Cape Town and Europe and the Sacs cable, which carries traffic from Angola across the Atlantic Ocean to Latin America and on to the US.

A spokesman for Openserve, Telkom’s wholesale networks subsidiary and an investor in both Sat-3 and Wacs, told TechCentral that repairs to Wacs are expected to be completed on Tuesday. Internet traffic should start flowing across the system soon thereafter.

This follows the repair of the older and lower-capacity Sat-3 cable system, which was repaired and came back into service on 7 April, Openserve confirmed to TechCentral. Wiocc, an investor in the Ace cable, confirmed that the Ace system has also been repaired and is again operational.

The repairs have taken some time as repair ships had to set sail from thousands of kilometres away to attend to the severed cables. The repair process involves lifting the cables off the ocean floor, making repairs on board the ship and then lowering the cables carefully back down to the ocean floor.

Seismic events are a common cause of cable faults along Africa’s west coast, with previous disruptions occurring in the deep Congo Canyon off the coast of the Democratic Republic of Congo. In other parts of the world, such as in the busy Red Sea shipping corridor, cable cuts are often the result of ships dropping anchor on them.

### Repair process

The status of the MainOne cable repair could not immediately be ascertained.

The CS Sovereign, a cable repair ship that repaired the Ace and Wacs cables has also reportedly been assigned to the MainOne cable repair. Ship-tracking website marinetraffic.com shows the UK-registered vessel was stationed offshore near Ivory Coast at the time of writing.

However, MTN Ghana announced on March 18 that it had secured additional network capacity from its international partners, resulting in an improvement in data connectivity.

MTN Ghana promised its clients that it was examining all possibilities to alleviate the data difficulties they were facing.

###### **Ghana needs a robust contingency plan**

Meanwhile, the Executive Director of the Centre for Maritime Law and Security, Dr. Kamal-Deen Ali, has emphasised the importance of the country having a robust plan to reduce its over-reliance on submarine cables for data transfer.

In an interview with Alfred Ocansey, host of TV3’s **Ghana Tonight** programme on Friday, March 15, Dr. Kamal-Deen Ali stated that there must be “thorough discussions on the disruptions” that can happen to submarine cables to inform future action.

He noted that “disruptions such as this do happen from time to time,” stressing that “as a country, we must have [a very robust contingency plan](https://3news.com/news/undersea-cable-cut-we-need-a-robust-contingency-plan-dr-ali/) to deal with such disruptions when they happen.”

According to the maritime security expert, there are clear indications that the country did not have any plan to address the issue of the internet blackout, which has lasted close to 48 hours since the incident occurred.","The article titled ""Undersea cable cut: MTN Group restores 100% network connectivity globally"" directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables by discussing the disruptions caused by undersea cable cuts and their impact on network connectivity.

MainOne has announced the completion of repair works on its submarine cable with a final splice in the morning of Sunday, July 2, 2017. The company has also conducted subsequent tests to ensure the cable is in good operating condition.

In a statement issued by the company, the Chief Executive Officer, Funke Opeke expressed the company’s appreciation to its customers and partners for the patience and support during the recent outage incident on the MainOne submarine cable which occurred on Sunday June 18, 2017.

Describing the outage as a Force Majeure, due to movement in the seabed, the Chief Executive Officer highlighted the company’s efforts to resolve the outage to its customers.

“The submarine cable fault was in a known area of ridges in the seabed, at a location 3400 meters water depth in the international waters outside Senegal. After we discovered the outage and isolated the fault to a location 3000km South of Portugal, our operational processes and disaster recovery plans worked as expected and we deployed a repair vessel from our membership in the Atlantic Cable and Maintenance Agreement which left France by 8am on Monday June 19th 2017. The vessel travelled to Portland, United Kingdom, where it picked up critical spares and then journeyed to the repair location which was further isolated to within a 2 kilometer range while the vessel was in transit. We have concluded a full repair of the submarine cable with a final splice yesterday, Sunday July 2, 2017. The cable has been tested to be in good operating condition and we have since restored all our customer’s services to normal operating conditions”, she said.

She continued “During this period, we had some restoration capacity and rerouted internet traffic on our network via alternative routes to minimize the impact of the outage to our customers. However, we were unable to provide enough capacity and interconnection to fully restore our entire network. We realize many of our customers have become solely reliant on MainOne for Internet services and we will continue to secure more restoration capacity in case of any such eventualities in the future”.

While thanking its customers and partners for their cooperation and support during this outage, the company reiterated its commitment to transforming West Africa from a resource-based economy to a fully digitized, knowledge-based economy.","The article discusses the completion of repairs on a submarine cable, detailing a specific incident where the MainOne submarine cable experienced an outage due to movement in the seabed.

Local publication Matangi Tonga Online reported that the service was back up and running on Wednesday (July 12).

The damage to the cable was caused when a large underwater volcano erupted close to Tonga in January 2022, triggering tsunamis reaching heights of almost three feet in places.

Both the international Tonga Cable – laid in 2013 and running 827km to Fiji – and the Tonga Domestic Cable connecting the islands of Vavaʻu, Lifuka, and Tongatapu were damaged. The island nation’s international cable was repaired a month after the eruption.

In total, the amount of cable used in reconnecting the cable system was just over 108km, according to Tonga Cable Limited (TCL), which had to wait for the replacement cable to arrive from France.

The lengthy wait was somewhat expected, with DCD reporting last year that if a local replacement can’t be sourced, it could take a year to repair.

""The reason it has taken so long to get the domestic cable repaired is due to the lack of the required amount and type of cable to carry out the repair job. It took five months to confirm the amount of cable to order from Alcatel Submarine Networks (ASN),"" said Tonga Cable Ltd.

“This needed to await the survey results which were being conducted by the New Zealand organization known as the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) in April/May 2022.""

After the order was placed, it took ASN a further seven months to manufacture the cable, stated TCL, and another four months for the order to be shipped from ASN in France, before a final two months for the cable ship to get to Tonga.

The actual repair of the cable took eight days, and was carried out by a crew of 57 people, with the cable repair ship, C/S Lodbrog, owned and operated jointly by ASN and Optic Marine (OMS). The repair began when the ship arrived in Tonga waters on July 5.","The article titled 'Tonga's Domestic submarine cable fixed 18 months after volcanic eruption' discusses the damage caused to Tonga's submarine cable system due to a volcanic eruption and the subsequent repair process.

MainOne says: “The cable has been tested to be in good operating condition and we have restored all services to normal operating conditions and provisioned additional capacity wavelengths to address increased demand for internet connectivity from our wholesale and enterprise customers across west Africa.”

The cable, which was laid seven years ago as the first broadband cable to serve west Africa, was cut at 05:18 on 18 June.

“Initial investigation conducted into the failure of communications on the fibre pairs into Portugal indicated a fault on the submarine cable system, which was further localised to a location about 3000km south of Portugal, where the cable is at 3400m water depth,” says the report. “This assessment suggested that the outage was not a likely outcome of external human factors such as a dropped ship anchor or trawler fishing or sabotage since such activities generally do not take place at such ocean depths.”

The morning after the failure, the Pierre de Fermat was already on the way from its home port of Brest, heading for Portland in the UK to pick up spares.

The Pierre de Fermat arrived on site a week later, and grappled up the broken ends of the cable – showing a landslide was the most likely cause. The slide “trapped and crushed the cable thus resulting in a cut to both the fibre and power cables within the cable enclosure”. The damaged section was replaced with new cable from Portland, which was spliced into the broken ends.

X-ray images of the final spliced cable showed good quality joints. MainOne executive Bernard Logan – who has 30 years’ experience in the subsea cable industry, since joining what was then STC Submarine Systems in 1986 – approved the powering up of the cable from the terminal stations. “The vessel started the process of lowering the submarine cable back to the seabed and it was guided into position.”

After further tests once the cable was back on the sea bed, “all the active wavelengths carrying traffic on the system were again activated and verified and traffic started being restored onto the cable system”, says the report. “MainOne engineers who had been on the sidelines in recent weeks were delighted to have the system back in working order and within a few hours, all services were restored back onto the cable system.","The article titled ""MainOne fixes cable break after seabed landslide"" discusses a specific incident involving a submarine cable that was cut due to a seabed landslide.

**Seacom said on** Monday that it is experiencing a disruption affecting its cable system in the Red Sea, the site of current heightened geopolitical tensions.

News of the disruption comes just weeks after warnings that Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have been disrupting commercial shipping traffic in the region, might seek to sabotage Western internet cables in the Red Sea.

Seacom said in a statement that the portion of its East African cable system that transits the Red Sea went down on Saturday, affecting traffic flow between Africa and Europe.

“The disruption is only on the segment of the cable that runs from Mombasa (Kenya) to Zafarana (Egypt). Initial assessments suggest that the disruption to the subsea cable occurred within the vicinity of the Red Sea, and other cables in the area appear to have also been impacted,” it said.

It did not say which other cables were impacted, and there don’t yet appear to be any news reports of other cable outages in the Red Sea.

“At this time, Seacom is unable to confirm the cause of the disruption but is working with its cable repair partner to assess the feasibility of the repair in the region. The location of the cable break is significant due to its geopolitical sensitivity and ongoing tensions, making it a challenging environment for maintenance and repair operations.”

### Little impact

The outage appears to have had little impact on international internet traffic to South Africa, probably because new cable systems, including Google’s newly launched Equiano system, now provide a secondary, high-capacity route to Europe along Africa’s west coast.

Earlier this month, TechCentral reported that the threat by Houthi rebels in Yemen to destroy internet infrastructure in the Red Sea, if carried out, might not be enough to destabilise the internet in Africa.

The Guardian and other news outlets reported at the time that telecommunications firms linked to the Yemeni government feared that Houthi rebels off the coast were threatening to destroy undersea cable infrastructure connecting parts of the Middle East, Africa and much of Asia to the Western world.

Apart from being one of the world’s busiest shipping corridors, the Red Sea is also host to some of the world’s biggest intercontinental subsea cables, including several that run along Africa’s east coast, TechCentral has reported.

The news reports about a potential attack on the subsea cables come after a Houthi-linked Telegram channel published a map of the cables running through the Red Sea along with what has been interpreted as a veiled threat.

Seacom said it “continues to carry traffic on its own cable between Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and South Africa for both transmission and IP (internet protocol) services”.

“All other IP-based services destined for Europe and other regions were automatically rerouted via Seacom’s alternative routes on the Equiano, Peace and Wacs cable systems and supported by its diverse terrestrial infrastructure, ensuring its clients remain operational with some latency in their internet communications,” the company said.

Seacom warned its customers earlier this month that any disruptions to the cable system in the Red Sea could be impacted by delays in repair operations due to the instability of the area. “The team is currently working towards restoration timelines and will communicate these plans with our clients,” it said in its statement on Monday. – © 2024 NewsCentral Media

"Bold Rwanda Takes Broadband Leap","Newly arrived undersea cables set to boost Rwanda's internet connectivity significantly.","http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8266290.stm","2009-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","",Yes,-,"London, England, GB",-,"2009-09-21","English","BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation)","**Bold Rwanda takes broadband leap**  
By Adam Blenford  
BBC News, Kigali  
  
Landlocked Rwanda is weeks away from completing a link to a new fibre-optic network promising high-speed internet for East Africa, officials say. Engineers expect the capital, Kigali, to be connected to newly arrived undersea cables in Kenya by November. A national fibre-optic ring is due to go online early in 2010.  
  
The new link is the key part of a plan to transform Rwanda from an impoverished, agricultural society into a hi-tech economic innovator. Most of Rwanda's nine million inhabitants still make a living from small-scale farming, and much of the country remains without basic services - including a reliable electricity supply.  
  
Yet 15 years after a genocide, which saw around 800,000 Rwandans brutally murdered, the government - led by one-time rebel leader President Paul Kagame - appears determined to push ahead with development on multiple fronts.  
  
Rwanda remains one of the poorest countries in the world, but has a fast-growing population, of which more than 50% are aged 14 or under. ""We're in a hurry,"" Patrick Nyirishema told the BBC. ""In five or 10 years' time, all those people are going to be looking for jobs.""  
  
Mr Nyirishema, a slight man of 34, took up his post at the helm of Rwanda's Information Technology Authority just one week ago. He found 160 ongoing projects in his in-tray. ""Rwanda is the most densely populated country in the continent, and most of our people are subsistence farmers,"" he said. ""We can't wait until we have water, until we have built roads, before we get round to ICT (information and communications technology). We have to do everything at the same time.""  
  
**Held back**  
Evidence of Africa's need for faster connectivity is easy to spot. In central Kigali, towering satellite dishes belonging to one private company bring in most of the country's existing internet bandwidth. As in other parts of East Africa which have long relied on satellite connections, the links are in the hands of a handful of operators and are sold on at high prices way out of reach of most ordinary Rwandans.  
  
For a country which has publicly stated an ambition to turn itself into ""the Singapore of Africa"" - a globally important centre for business and communications - the reliance on satellite has held the country back. Most Rwandans lack significant computer skills and few have regular access to the internet. Many of those who do are yet to explore the web's full potential. ""I first used the internet one year ago,"" said Carine Umulisa, a 24-year-old Kigali student. ""I sometimes go to the cyber cafe and I send messages to my family. It's very expensive now. But it's important for Rwanda to develop technology.""  
  
Even where there is bandwidth, people struggle with unpredictable connections. A bus carrying 20 laptop computers is currently travelling the country offering internet services to students and local business people. When BBC News visited the bus in Kamonyi district, an area just 30 minutes' drive from Kigali but without any mains electricity, the connection was so erratic that the young people using the facility were unable even to sign up for their first e-mail account.  
  
**Great leap forward**  
At the national stadium in Kigali, inconspicuous antennae tethered to a floodlight pylon are the only outward sign of one of Rwanda's most arresting projects. When operational, the antennae will blanket the city with a WiBro (Wireless Broadband) signal - a state-of-the-art South Korean wireless protocol - sometimes known as Wimax - designed to funnel data at high speed to new 4G mobile devices.  
  
It is a clear statement of intent - building a 21st Century mobile data network in a country where many people still eke out a 19th Century existence. But officials brush off suggestions that the WiBro network could be too niche, or that the cost of compatible devices will be prohibitively high. Linking Rwanda to the technology giants of South Korea and China is as safe as bets come, they say.  
  
""We are really focussing on the future,"" one project engineer, Manzi Rwaka, told the BBC. ""We are doing our best not to be left out of the world.""  
  
In a way, Mr Rwaka, 27, embodies the new country Rwanda is trying to become. Born outside of Rwanda after his family fled following the first outbreak of deadly civil violence in 1959, his parents chose to return home after the 1994 genocide, when Paul Kagame's RPF took power. Fifteen years later, and with a university education in South Africa under his belt, Mr Rwaka works on the WiBro project and speaks in an almost evangelical tone about the future of his country.  
  
""Coming from where we have been, we really want to focus on our position in the region. We know we are in a difficult situation but we are trying to get out of it. We want a solid economy and we will get there.  
  
""If we sit down and wait for others to do something [we] might be waiting forever.""  
  
**Critics muted**  
As the size of Mr Nyirishema's in-tray suggests, the WiBro plan is just one of many technology projects Rwanda's government is trying to push through in a hurry. But while the scale of the ambition is clear, concerns remain that the government may be aiming too high.  
  
In stark contrast to a regional neighbour such as Kenya, where mobile phone penetration is almost universal, just 20% of Rwandans own mobile phones, state media reported this week. In an effort to boost mobile phone use and give farmers easy access to market information, the government plans to hand out 35,000 mobile phones across the country as part of a joint venture with major telecoms operators.  
  
According to accepted international indicators Rwanda remains a desperately poor country, with a per capita annual income of just $315. Women each have an average of 5.5 children. And some Western observers are critical of President Paul Kagame's hard-headed style of government. Amnesty International's annual report on global human rights issues regularly highlights the restricted nature of political debate in Rwanda and the lack of a free press.  
  
But Mr Kagame, president since 2001, appears to remain genuinely popular and plans to stand for a second full seven-year term in elections in 2010. Two other candidates are likely to stand - neither is expected to come close to victory.  
  
Despite his authoritarian tendencies, at the moment Mr Kagame appears to have support for his efforts to transform his country. He first identified technology as the way forward for Rwanda back in 1997, as the country began its long recovery from genocide.  
  
Today, in a continent cursed with leaders who show an authoritarian streak and yet fail to improve the lot of their people, few appear willing to criticise Mr Kagame.  
  
""Technology sits at the centre of everything we do,"" Patrick Nyirishema explained. ""But the biggest challenge we face is skills. Every extra step we take comes with a need for new skills.""  
  
With the arrival of East Africa's fibre-optic cables, Paul Kagame's bold strategy is about to get the connectivity it needs. Whether the farmers and schoolchildren in electricity-starved Kamonyi can become the skilled workers Rwanda needs in the years to come is yet to be seen.","The article 'Bold Rwanda takes broadband leap' mentions 'newly arrived undersea cables' and discusses their significance for improving Rwanda's internet connectivity.

Eight West African countries were suffering a second day of major connectivity issues on Friday with users in South Africa also affected, after damage to four subsea cables. The cause of the cable cutting was still not known, though a shifting of the seabed was among the likely possibilities.

“Repairs can take weeks to months, depending on where the damage is, what needs to be repaired, and local weather conditions,” said a spokesperson at internet analytics firm Cloudflare. “The assignment of repair ships depends on a number of factors, including ownership of the impacted cables.”

The West Africa Cable System, MainOne, South Atlantic 3, and ACE sea cables – arteries for telecommunications data – were all affected on Thursday and Friday.

MTN Group – one of the largest wireless carriers in Africa – said that ACE and WACS have jointly initiated the repair process, and that they would send a vessel to fix the damaged cables.

Orange Marine said the firm was one of the specialist companies that would be involved in the repair operations for the cables, adding that other companies are also involved in efforts to restore the various cables. It said the repair time is not yet known.

Data show a major disruption to connectivity in eight West African countries, with Ivory Coast, Liberia and Benin being the most affected, NetBlocks, an internet watchdog, said in a post on X. Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon are among other countries impacted. Several companies have also reported service disruptions in South Africa.

Ghana’s main stock exchange extended trading hours by an hour on Thursday and Friday, while Nigeria’s second-largest cement maker scrapped a call with investors as the damage to four subsea cables off the west coast of Africa, stymied businesses across parts of the continent.

“This is a devastating blow to internet connectivity along the west coast of Africa, which will be operating in a degraded state for weeks to come,” said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis firm Kentik.

Ghana’s National Communications Authority said cable disruptions also occurred in Senegal and Portugal.

“This has led to a significant degradation of data services across the country, with mobile network operators working around the clock to restore full services,” the authority said.

The cable faults off Ivory Coast come less than a month after three telecommunications cables were severed in the Red Sea, highlighting the vulnerability of critical communications infrastructure. The anchor of a cargo ship sunk by Houthi militants was probably responsible, according to assessments by the US and cable industry group the Internet Cable Protection Committee.

Together, the problems with cables on either side of the continent create a capacity crunch, with customers of those cables scrambling to find alternative routes.

Microsoft Corp. reported disruptions to its cloud services and Microsoft 365 applications across Africa.

The Downdetector website showed that a number of companies in South Africa were still severely affected on Friday, including Microsoft and Nedbank Group.

Telkom SA SOC’s Openserve fiber unit and Standard Bank Group were also affected, they said in statement, with Openserve adding it had re-routed traffic.

Off the southeastern coast of South Africa, the island country of Mauritius also experienced outages, with Mauritius Telecom having to arrange to redirect traffic to other cables, it said.

Last year, WACS, along with another pipe – the South Atlantic 3 – were damaged near the mouth of the Congo River following an undersea landslide. The loss of the cables knocked out international traffic traveling along the west coast of Africa and took about a month to repair.","The article titled 'Africa Internet Outage Risks Leaving Millions Offline for Weeks' explicitly discusses the damage to undersea cables off the west coast of Africa, which has led to significant internet connectivity issues across multiple countries.

The West African Cable System (WACS) and the South Atlantic 3 (SAT-3/WASC) undersea cables have been broken. The two cables reportedly suffered breaks between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon due to two separate rock falls in the Congo Canyon on Sunday.

The cable ship _CS Léon Thévenin_ has been mobilized for the deep-water repair, but could take several weeks to arrive at the break site as it is currently sailing from Kenya on the east coast of Africa and will have to sail around the Horn of Africa.

Telkom’s wholesale fixed-line division Openserve has confirmed the issue but hasn’t provided an estimated repair date.

“Openserve can confirm the breaks of the WACS and SAT-3 undersea cables. We are collaborating with the consortium partners to facilitate the restoration of these cables. The impact on our network is limited to customers on the international private leased circuits (IPLC) services,” the company said.

“The Openserve network remains robust due to our investment in other international cable capacity, hence all Openserve IP Transit services (WebReach) traffic have been automatically re-routed, ensuring our customers stay seamlessly connected.”

SA's state-owned wholesale infrastructure provider Broadband Infraco confirmed the cable break in a now-deleted post on X (previously Twitter).

Cameroonian telco CamTel also noted the issue; however, it said the SAT-3 cable suffered damages off the coast of Gabon and on the land section of Abidjan on the Ivory Coast.

Telecom Namibia also reported issues due to the cuts. Stanley Shanapinda, Telecom Namibia’s CEO, said: “Telecom Namibia would like to assure its customers that it is working around the clock with its international support partners to ensure that all functionalities are fully restored to normalcy. We have been proactive by re-routing the traffic to ensure our customers stay seamlessly connected.”

**Update**: David Eurin, CEO of Liquid Dataport, a business of Liquid Intelligent Technologies, said: “As part of our disaster recovery process and to offer high redundancy to our customers, we have migrated our customers’ West Coast traffic to our new Equiano subsea cable. Whilst this additional capacity has brought in a much-needed increase in bandwidth in Western and Southern Africa, the redundancy is also the reason why we are able to minimize the impact on our customers.”

Congo Canyon is a submarine canyon found at the end of the Congo River in Africa. It is one of the largest submarine canyons in the world, reaching depths of 1,100 meters and widths of up to nine miles (14km).

Laid in 2012, the 14,500 km WACS cable runs from South Africa to the UK, calling at 12 countries en route. Owned by a consortium of 12 carriers including MTN and Vodacom, it has a total design capacity of 14.5 Tbps.

The 13000km SAT-3/WASC cable, laid in 2001, connects South Africa to Spain and Portugal and lands at eight other countries en route. SAT-3 has a capacity of 340 Gbps and is owned by a consortium of operators including Orange (then France Telecom), AT&T-owned TCI, Sonatel, and Telcom.

“Multiple undersea cable failures between South Africa and Europe are currently impacting South Africa’s network providers, including Vodacom,” Vodacom spokesman Byron Kennedy told TechCentral at 2.22pm on Thursday.

Multiple sources have told TechCentral that there has been an undersea incident impacting multiple cables along Africa’s west coast. According to Microsoft, four cables have been affected.

One source said the break may have occurred off the coast of Abidjan, the capital of the Ivory Coast in West Africa. The main internet cables that connect South Africa to Europe run along the west coast of Africa, including the West Africa Cable System (Wacs) and Google’s Equiano cable.

According to Microsoft, the affected cables are Wacs, MainOne, Sat-3 and Ace.

This is the second time in seven months that a major cable break along Africa’s coastline has severely impacted internet services in South Africa.

And the latest outage could not have come at a worse time, given that the Seacom cable, which connects South Africa to Europe along Africa’s east coast, was recently severed in the Red Sea, possibly as the result of a ship’s anchor. Repairs to the Seacom cable will take time as a result of the geopolitical instability in the region.

Seacom confirmed to TechCentral on Thursday that the Wacs cable, on which it carries traffic, is down, but that internet traffic is still flowing across the Equiano system — and that is good news, as it means a lot of the west coast internet traffic on Wacs (and the other affected cables) can be diverted.

Internet connection in Congo-Brazzaville was restored on Saturday after 15 days of nationwide disruptions and slowdowns that started since June 9, 2017, after damage to the country’s main submarine cables.

It was restored ahead of the five-week projected period given by the technical team working on the cut cable.

Network providers confirmed days after the outage that the problem was caused by a submarine cable cut off in the Atlantic Ocean near the economic capital Pointe-Noire.

Cedric Nzimbou, a network engineer with SkyTic Telecom – one of the country’s major network providers – told Africanews that the “12-kilometer fibre optic West African Cable System (WACS) that connects the country through Pointe-Noire to the international cable was cut off by a fishing vessel”.

He added that network providers were forced to provide internet using V-SAT which is slow and expensive as a result of huge taxes paid to use the service.

This was connected via a cable from Kinshasa in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo.

Local media reported that the damage to the submarine cables was caused by a suspected Chinese fishing vessel.

Terra firma links between cities and cables that run alongside roads and into houses and offices are certainly impressive -- and without them we wouldn't have an internet! -- but sinking a cable into the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and even Arctic Oceans requires a billion-dollar logistical feat that requires months or even years to enact.

Across these cables, which span distances of up to 13,000 km (8,000 miles) and have total lengths over 21,000 km (13,000 miles), terabits of information squirt from one side of the planet to another. To get from London to Tokyo, your packets can traverse Europe, the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea, the Indian Ocean, and finally the South China Sea -- or they can hop across the Atlantic, the entirety of continental North America, and then long haul over the Pacific. For a complete (and interactive!) view of the world's 188 planned and active submarine cables, check out Greg's Cable Map or TeleGeography.

These cables are just three inches thick, carry just a few optic fibers, and have total capacities of between 40Gbps and 10Tbps, and latencies that are close to the speed of light and just a few milliseconds in duration. As far as laying a submarine cable, specialized cable-laying ships must be used -- and again, when a cable is broken (usually by a trawler, but sometimes a whale!), another special ship must be used. This generally means that laying a cable is logistically challenging and very expensive -- and when a cable breaks, it sometimes isn't possible to fix it immediately if a cable-fixing ship isn't nearby (and for this reason, most submarine cables use a ring topology in case one stretch is broken).

It's also amazing to consider that the first trans-Atlantic cables were laid in the 1860s, and trans-Pacific cables followed in the early 1900s. These cables were incredibly low-bandwidth -- repeaters didn't exist yet, so the only way of getting a signal across the pond was by upping the voltage and creating a very noisy link -- but by the early 1900s, the British Empire had already connected up most of the continents. It's also worth noting that the only continent that isn't wired into the internet is Antarctica; the temperature of the Antarctic Ocean is too low, and the movement of the ice shelf by up to 10 meters per year is tricky to overcome.

Finally, we would be remiss to ignore geostationary, orbital communications satellites. While satellite data links can be in the gigabit range, the high latency of bouncing a signal through a point that is rather far away (35,000 km, 22,000 miles) makes them unsuitable for many consumer internet services.","The article discusses submarine cables, including the implications of their breakage.

"Africa Internet Outage Risks Leaving Millions Offline for Weeks","Millions at risk of being offline for weeks due to damaged undersea cables affecting internet connectivity across multiple African countries.","https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/networks/africa-internet-outage-risks-leaving-millions-offline-weeks","2024-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","Bloomberg News; Mar",Yes,"Bloomberg News","San Francisco, California, USA",-,"2024-03-15","English","Bloomberg News","(Bloomberg) -- Disruption to internet services for millions of users in Africa could take weeks or even months to fix, following damage to undersea cables off the continent’s west coast.

Eight West African countries were suffering a second day of major connectivity issues on Friday with users in South Africa also affected, after damage to four sub-sea cables. The cause of the cable cutting was still not known, though a shifting of the seabed was among the likely possibilities.

“Repairs can take weeks to months, depending on where the damage is, what needs to be repaired, and local weather conditions,” said a spokesperson at internet analytics firm Cloudflare. “The assignment of repair ships depends on a number of factors, including ownership of the impacted cables.”

The West Africa Cable System, MainOne, South Atlantic 3, and ACE sea cables – arteries for telecommunications data – were all affected on Thursday and Friday.

MTN Group – one of the largest wireless carriers in Africa – said that ACE and WACS have jointly initiated the repair process, and that they would send a vessel to fix the damaged cables.

Orange Marine said the firm was one of the specialist companies that would be involved in the repair operations for the cables, adding that other companies are also involved in efforts to restore the various cables. It said the repair time is not yet known.

Data show a major disruption to connectivity in eight West African countries, with Ivory Coast, Liberia and Benin being the most affected, NetBlocks, an internet watchdog, said in a post on X. Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon are among other countries impacted. Several companies have also reported service disruptions in South Africa.

Ghana’s main stock exchange extended trading hours by an hour on Thursday and Friday, while Nigeria’s second-largest cement maker scrapped a call with investors as the damage to four subsea cables off the west coast of Africa, stymied businesses across parts of the continent.

“This is a devastating blow to internet connectivity along the west coast of Africa, which will be operating in a degraded state for weeks to come,” said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis firm Kentik.

Ghana’s National Communications Authority said cable disruptions also occurred in Senegal and Portugal.

“This has led to a significant degradation of data services across the country, with mobile network operators working around the clock to restore full services,” the authority said.

The cable faults off Ivory Coast come less than a month after three telecommunications cables were severed in the Red Sea, highlighting the vulnerability of critical communications infrastructure. The anchor of a cargo ship sunk by Houthi militants was probably responsible, according to assessments by the US and cable industry group the Internet Cable Protection Committee.

Together, the problems with cables on either side of the continent create a capacity crunch, with customers of those cables scrambling to find alternative routes.

Microsoft Corp. reported disruptions to its cloud services and Microsoft 365 applications across Africa.

The Downdetector website showed that a number of companies in South Africa were still severely affected on Friday, including Microsoft and Nedbank Group.

Telkom SA SOC’s Openserve fiber unit and Standard Bank Group were also affected, they said in statement, with Openserve adding it had re-routed traffic.

Last year, WACS, along with another pipe – the South Atlantic 3 – were damaged near the mouth of the Congo River following an undersea landslide. The loss of the cables knocked out international traffic traveling along the west coast of Africa and took about a month to repair.","The article discusses significant disruptions to internet services in Africa due to damage to undersea cables, explicitly mentioning 'undersea cables' and 'sub-sea cables'.

"Liberians Hope for Improved Internet with ACE Submarine Cable Arrival","ACE submarine cable expected to enhance broadband access for over 20 countries, significantly improving Liberia's internet connectivity.","https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15692430","2023-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","Bonnie Allen; Rob Hugh-Jones",Yes,"Bonnie Allen; Rob Hugh-Jones","London, United Kingdom","1500000","2023-02-06","English","BBC News","**Getting online is difficult in Liberia. Connections are slow and expensive. Earlier this month, a fibre optic cable was brought ashore which some claim will transform the country's communications.**  

A crowd gathers on a sandy beach near central Monrovia to watch as a diver emerges from the sea.  
He's pulling a rope which a team on the beach helps drag ashore.  
Eventually, a black cable pops out of the water and slithers up the sand, prompting cheers from the crowd.  
In the background, several miles offshore, a French ship is at anchor. It's dragging the cable 17,000km (10,000 miles) from France to Cape Town, via the west coast of Africa.  
The cable, which is just two inches thick but stuffed with fibre optics, is known as the Africa Coast to Europe (ACE) system, run by a consortium led by French Telecom. It will eventually provide broadband connectivity to more than 20 countries.  

**Celebration**  
News of the cable's arrival on land is welcomed by a small group of men in an internet cafe in Monrovia. For them, getting online currently costs around $2 per hour - more money than many Liberians earn in a day.  
""The internet here is very slow,"" says Emmanuel Dolo who is trying to apply for a scholarship online. ""Sometimes you pay for an hour and only get to use 20 minutes. It just keeps loading and loading. It's frustrating.""  
Liberia's business community feels the same way, says Ciata Victor, a businesswoman who returned from abroad in 2003 after the prolonged civil war - which destroyed much of the country's infrastructure - ended.  
""I moved my company home from America to Liberia and internet access has been extremely challenging. I have paid as high as $449 a month,"" she says.  

**Cheaper and faster**  
The current high cost and relatively slow internet connection in Liberia is not surprising, says Calestous Juma, Professor of the Practice of International Development at Harvard, and an expert in telecommunications in Africa.  
""Fibre optic cables have more capacity and provide more consistent data flow than the current satellite connections being used,"" he says. ""Satellite communication involves sending a signal into orbit and back. The delay, or latency, can take up to a second and that affects the quality of communication.""  
Initial start-up costs for satellite transmission are also very high, he adds.  
That's in part why there is so much excitement over the arrival of the fibre optic cable.  
""In West Africa our penetration is very low,"" says Blidi Elliott who works on a World Bank project to increase the geographical reach of broadband in Liberia. ""During the civil war years the political will needed to bring broadband to the country was not there."" It is now, he says.  

**An internet boom?**  
For Liberia, as well as Gambia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the ACE submarine cable is the first connection to a fibre optic system.  
And it's part of a developing pattern in Africa, where currently only 9.6% of people are web users, compared to around 65% of Europeans. Africa may be lagging behind, but recent reports, including a study from the World Bank, suggest it's on the verge of an internet boom.  
Mr Elliott says he's confident that internet use in Liberia will increase by 75% in the next four years, even though many people have never even used a computer.  
Mr Juma from Harvard says that may not be the obstacle it seems.  

**Obstacles remain**  
But if that step sounds easy, the next practical steps for this project in Liberia, sound a lot tougher.  
""Landing the cable in Monrovia is a first important step,"" says Mr Juma. ""The next will be installing terrestrial cables for the national and local networks, as well as for mobile phone towers. This will require major additional investment.""  
The ACE cable will eventually connect 23 countries including Mauritania, Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Mali and Niger, which are landlocked, will be connected via an overland cable.  
Project leaders say, all being well, the cable system in Liberia will be switched on in the middle of next year.","The article discusses the arrival of the ACE submarine cable to Liberia, directly referring to it as a 'submarine cable' and highlighting its significance for improving internet connectivity in the region.

It elaborates on the implications of this cable, noting that it will provide broadband connectivity to over 20 countries and transform communications in Liberia.

There is local phone service within each island, but island to island and long distance is out. The outage is affecting 911 service from Lopez, Shaw and Orcas to dispatch on Friday Harbor.

For Friday Harbor residents, there is also no cell coverage or internet service.

The outage is due to a problem with the underwater cable between Lopez and San Juan Islands. No ETA for return of service, but this is a significant repair that will require specialized equipment and personnel to fix. OPALCO has a robust data communications infrastructure installed across the county to serve our electrical distribution system and is making those resources available to aid its fellow utility.

Centurylink issued the following statement:

A fiber optic cable has been cut underwater between Lopez and San Juan Islands impacting CenturyLink services, including 911 services, throughout the islands. 911 services on San Juan Island have been rerouted to the local 911 center. Customers are able to access the Internet on all islands with the exception of San Juan Island. Because of the nature of the damage it is difficult to estimate a time of restoration. CenturyLink is working to restore services as soon as possible.

To access 911, call the following numbers:

Lopez Island: 468-2991

Orcas Island: 376-2331

Shaw Island: 468-2991

San Juan Island’s 911 is still operational.

For those who rely on Life Alert or Medic Alert, those will likely not work in the event of an emergency. Most life alert systems route via the phone line to an off-island call center, making that connection impossible at present. The Orcas Senior Center is asking who anyone who uses a personal emergency paging device to call 376-2677. Staff will work on a case by case basis to develop a contact plan to assist in ensuring people remain safe during this time.

News from Sen. Kevin Ranker:

“It is confirmed that a deep water offshore cable was completely severed. CenturyLink has divers and an ROV (Remotely operated vehicle) on scene. The ultimate goal will be to replace the entire 14,000′ cable, but locating that length of fiber-optic cable will take time. In the meantime two more immediate actions are underway. First, CenturyLink is working with OPALCO to do a short term Ethernet fix so that our entire county would have 911 availability as soon as possible – maybe as soon as late today. Secondly, CenturyLink has identified 6,000 feet of cable that could be used as a temporary fix that would give all county residents all services.

Openserve, Telkom’s wholesale subsidiary, which is responsible for the cable landing stations in South Africa for both the West African Cable System (Wacs) and Sat-3, confirmed in response to a query from TechCentral that both cables are affected and it is “collaborating with the consortium partners to facilitate the restoration of the cables.”

Sat-3, the older of the two cables, carries relatively little international internet traffic; Wacs, on the other hand, is a more recent cable system and is used extensively to carry traffic between South Africa and Europe.

Broken subsea cables are repaired by specialised ships, one or more of which will have to be commissioned to go to the site of the cable breaks and begin repairs. TechCentral was not able to ascertain the reason for the cable breaks or where exactly they occurred. However, state-owned infrastructure company Broadband Infraco tweeted that it had information that the break in the Wacs cable had occurred in the Congo Canyon off the coast of the Democratic Republic of Congo, 3 686km north of the Yzerfontein landing station near Cape Town.

Until recently, a break in two submarine cables would have meant the global internet being barely accessible by South African users. However, new, high-capacity cables have been built in recent years, providing much more bandwidth along diverse routes, meaning that when there is an outage, the impact is no longer as serious.

Still, the Wacs and Sat-3 outages do appear to be affecting the performance of some service providers. A speed test to London on Vodacom Business fibre, for example, delivered a download speed of just 3Mbit/s on Monday afternoon.

As we noted back in September, existing trans-Pacific cables generally provide on average 3.3 tbps of capacity. But bandwidth is getting tight and carriers have recently been scrambling to upgrade these cables or, in some cases, build entirely new ones (like Verizon).

According to research firm TeleGeography, trans-Pacific internet traffic shot up 41 percent between mid-2006 and mid-2007. But as the only non-telecom company in the new consortium, don't expect Google's involvement to signal a new trend, analysts warn.

""Although many non-telecom companies have high bandwidth requirements, few will venture into owning submarine cables anytime soon,"" said TeleGeography's research director Alan Mauldin in a Monday research note.

That likely has a lot to do with cost. As it stands, the Unity cable will cost $300 million to build and the task will be split between Tyco Telecommunications and NEC.

Add to that the fact that the sub-sea cable business isn't the most stable or lucrative, and Google's involvement seems more of an attempt simply to bring down the cost of moving massive amounts of traffic around the world.

""You add markets with new supply, and the price is bound to come down,"" Eric Schoonover, a senior analyst at TeleGeography told Wired last fall. ""There's even a risk of it collapsing,"" he says, as it did in 2000.

Nevertheless, Google's investment in the Unity cable seems to be in line with the company's approach to buying (and lighting) dark fiber here in the U.S., experts say, and will now give it the chance to acquire even more capacity at cost.

Unity is initially expected to increase trans–Pacific lit cable capacity by about 20 percent, according to Telegeography, with the potential to add up to 7.68 tbps of bandwidth across the Pacific.

Google says the 6214 mile cable will provide connectivity between the Tokyo coast and Los Angeles, as well as other West Coast network points -- unless an anchor falls on it. Construction will begin immediately.

The one thing no one discussed on Monday was how much Google (or any other consortium member) is actually chipping in for Unity. Based on previous conversations with analysts, your bandwidth seems to be proportionate to the amount to money you plug into the consortium for buildout and other infrastructure costs. If everyone's forking over $50,000,000, that's one thing. But if Google feels it wants (or needs) a little extra bandwidth, the company could end up fronting quite a bit more than 50 mil. Google did not immediately respond to our request for comment.","The article 'Google's Submarine Cable Plans Get Official' discusses Google's investment in the Unity submarine cable project, which is a direct reference to undersea cables.

There’s just something about undersea internet cables that seem to have them get severed in groups. You may recall the various conspiracy theories that cropped up, at the beginning of the year, after four such cables were broken at about the same time, severely limiting internet connectivity in parts of the world. And, today, it seems like a similar situation, with three undersea cables all getting cut in a short period of time. All of the cuts happened in a span of less than 40 minutes, with the first two occurring within five minutes of each other. There was apparently some “seismic” activity right before the cuts, so that’s obviously the most likely cause — but it’s going to take a while to fix, and once again we have parts of the world with greatly reduced internet access. 

Anyway, as with last time, I’ll use this as an opportunity to point you to Neal Stephenson’s fantastic 1996 article about the laying of the FLAG undersea cables (one of the cut ones is a FLAG cable). Consider it weekend reading, and be warned that it may take the entire weekend to read (but it’s worth it).","The article titled ""Why Do Undersea Cables Seem To Get Severed In Bunches?"" discusses the phenomenon of undersea cables being cut in groups, specifically referencing incidents where multiple cables were severed within a short timeframe.

It highlights a specific case where three undersea cables were cut within 40 minutes, which severely limited internet connectivity in various parts of the world.

The article also connects the cuts to seismic activity, providing context for the events.

This aligns with the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables, as it directly addresses the subject with detailed examples and implications on telecommunications."
"New Africa Broadband Link Launch","Transition from expensive satellite connections to high-speed internet with Seacom and Teams cables, improving connectivity in East Africa.","http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8257038.stm","2009-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","",Yes,"Adam Blenford","London, England","5000","2009-09-16","English","BBC","**New Africa broadband link 'ready'**  
**By Adam Blenford**  
**BBC News, Nairobi**  

A new high-speed undersea cable connecting East Africa with the rest of the world is poised to go live, Kenya's top internet official has told the BBC.  
The launch of the government-backed East African Marine System (Teams) comes as providers face a backlash over slow connection speeds and high prices.  
Internet providers have increased speeds and lowered costs since the Seacom cable went live in August.  
But users say services still remain too expensive for most ordinary Kenyans.  
Senior government official Bitange Ndemo said there was evidence that some internet service providers (ISPs) were ""fleecing the public"".  
Almost two months after the first high-speed cable made landfall, the highest residential internet speed offered by Kenya's largest ISP remains capped at one megabit per second (Mbps).  
That speed is available only at night and at weekends, for an annual cost of $1,440 (£860). The average Kenyan annual wage is about $800, the UN estimates.  

**Dongle dilemmas**  
Until late July, East African internet users were forced to pay for connections routed through expensive satellite connections.  
Uptake was slowed by costs and business competitiveness was hampered by the delay in sending data from one point to another via satellite.  
But with the imminent availability of the 1.28 terabits per second Teams connectivity, business figures, ISPs and the Kenyan government now insist that high-speed, low-cost internet is just around the corner.  
Links are being completed to other East African nations, ""digital villages"" are being built in rural areas, and the speeds on offer are increasing, albeit slowly.  
""The cable is here, it is functional, and they are selling capacity,"" Bitange Ndemo told the BBC.  
However, some in Nairobi feel that the cables themselves were over-hyped.  
""I thought the cable would land and the next week we would have fast internet at home,"" said Ken Kasima, a developer for the successful crowdsourcing service Ushahidi.  
Speaking at a cafe in the basement of a Nairobi shopping centre where fellow developers and programmers meet to use a free wi-fi connection, Mr Kasima said the price of his 512kbps internet connection was preventing him working effectively at home.  
His connection, like much of Kenya's personal internet in a country without a significant landline telephone network, is delivered by a mobile phone operator via a 3G dongle connected by USB. A top-up card gives him 1GB of data use for a fee of 2,500 Kenyan shillings (£20; $33).  
At that price, Mr Kasima insists he needs to carefully control what he does online in an effort not to waste his credit and his money. Even if the connection allowed it - which it barely does - listening to music or watching video online is not sensible.  
""When you take it in comparison to what you're doing, it's a lot (of money), trust me. It's like spending a million to buy a wheelbarrow,"" Mr Kasima said.  

**Slow process**  
Perhaps surprisingly, the managing director of one of Kenya's most prominent ISPs agrees with part of Mr Kasima's analysis.  
Jonathan Somen of Access Kenya told the BBC that some in the communications industry were guilty of making unwise pronouncements before the cables landed.  
But Mr Somen - whose company is a shareholder in Teams - freely admitted that his products were aimed at business users and ""high-end"" residential customers, pointing out that Kenya needs major and costly investment to build a modern telecoms infrastructure.  
""A lot of companies, ourselves included, have made significant investments in international and local infrastructure to deliver the new bandwidth,"" Mr Somen said.  
""The more people get connected the more the economies of scale will kick in and prices will come down, but you can't expect fibre to land and that's the answer to all of our prayers.  
""You have got to go through the stages to build up the infrastructure and the content.""  
His attitude is at odds with the approach of Bitange Ndemo, who called for those companies with investments to pay off to lower their prices to attract new customers.  
""In Africa the argument is always that there are fewer customers so there is a need to charge a high premium,"" he said.  
""That is what annoys me, because you need to have low prices to get more people.""  

**Market forces**  
On the outskirts of Nairobi, though, one place where prices have fallen is KenCall, an outsourcing company which says data costs have shrunk by 90% since Seacom went online.  
Where the company previously paid $3,000 for a one megabit per second (Mbps) connection via satellite, it now pays just $300, operations director Eric Nesbitt said.  
As a firm which routinely deals with foreign clients and tries to offer Africa as a viable business alternative to clients in Europe, the US and beyond, that cost reduction is critical.  
""We are now on equal terms with the rest of the world,"" Mr Nesbitt said, predicting that Kenya would now be just three years behind a country like the UK in adopting the latest technology.  
Adverts around Nairobi seem to back Mr Nesbitt's analysis. Billboards promoting digital TV packages and internet bundles loom large over the city. Internet TV is on the way.  
For Bitange Ndemo, the opportunities offered by the new connections are virtually unlimited.  
""We have just opened our market from 37 million to six billion,"" he said. ""We can become players if we work with a purpose. Africa can only succeed if we think that way.""","The article 'New Africa broadband link 'ready'' discusses the launch of undersea cables, specifically the Seacom and Teams cables, and their implications for internet connectivity in East Africa.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - A severed marine cable has left Somalia without internet for weeks, triggering losses for businesses, residents said, and adding a layer of chaos in a country where Islamist insurgents are carrying out a campaign of bombings and killings.

Abdi Anshuur, Somalia's minister for posts and telecommunications, told state radio that internet to the Horn of Africa state went down a month ago after a ship cut an undersea cable connecting it to global data networks.

Businesses have had to close or improvise to remain open and university students told Reuters their educational courses had been disrupted.

Anshuur said the outage was costing Somalia the equivalent of about $10 million in economic output.

""The night internet went off marked the end of my daily bread,"" Mohamed Nur, 22, told Reuters in the capital Mogadishu.

Nur said he now begged ""tea and cigarettes from friends"" after the internet cutoff also severed his monthly income of $500 that he took in from ads he developed and placed on the video website, YouTube.

Somalia's economy is still picking up slowly after a combined force of the army and an African Union peacekeeping force helped drive the Islamist group, al Shabaab, out of Mogadishu and other strongholds.

Al Shabaab wants to topple the western backed government and rule according to its strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law.

The group remains formidable and lethal, with its campaign of frequent bombings and killings a key source of significant security risk for most businesses and regular life.

Now the internet outage potentially compounds the hardships for most firms. Most young people who say they are unable to work because of the outage spend hours idling in front of tea shops.

Mohamed Ahmed Hared, commercial manager of Somali Optical Networks(SOON), a large internet service provider in the country, told Reuters his business was losing over a million dollars a day.

Hared's clients, he said, had reported a range of crippled services including passport and e-tickets printing and money remittances.

Some students and staff at the University of Somalia in Mogadishu told Reuters their learning had been disrupted because Google, which they heavily rely on for research, was now inaccessible.

The absence of especially popular internet sites like Facebook and YouTube and Google was, however, cause for celebration for some in the conservative, Muslim nation.

""My wife used to be (on) YouTube or Facebook every minute,"" Mohamud Osman, 45, said, adding the online activity would sometimes distract her from feeding her baby and that the habit had once forced him to try to get a divorce.

Broadband speeds on the Channel island immediately slowed to a trickle after the data cables, owned by telco JT, and the voice traffic cable, owned by ISP Sure, were severed. Network operators rerouted data to a separate cable connecting Jersey to the main French data networks to pick up the slack, but speeds are still below their usual level.

""We are working as quickly as we can to get our undersea cables repaired, and normal service resumed, and will keep customers up-to-date with what is an extremely challenging emergency engineering operation at sea,"" said Daragh McDermott, director of corporate affairs at JT.

""It is exceptionally unlucky and unprecedented for three submarine cables to the UK to be cut in the same day, and it proves the value of having multiple links in the network, in order to provide a backup connection via France.""

The coastguard is investigating, and the ship involved was reportedly the King Arthur, an Italian-registered liquefied petroleum gas tanker. It is believed to have anchored in a restricted area over the submarine cables and then dragged its anchor over them.

Luckily the cables are in relatively shallow waters, which should make finding the broken ends relatively easy. Divers or an unmanned submersible can be used in this case. For deep ocean breaks, cable repairers have to fish around on the seabed trying to find broken cables, which can be a long and expensive process.

Once found, the fiber optic cables will be spliced together, or a new section can be glued into place on the data pipe, before the whole thing is lowered back into the water.

Work has already started to fix the cables, JT said, and the first is expected to be repaired in a week.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon suffered its third day with only patchy Internet connectivity on Friday after the fiber optic cable it relies on was severed 30 miles off the coast of Egypt.

Telecoms Minister Nicholas Sehnaoui posted on his Twitter account that nearby Cyprus has agreed to reroute traffic until the cable was repaired. ""This will increase the speed back to normal all over Lebanon,"" he said.

But the Internet in the capital Beirut remained slow, or not working at all, on Friday, hampering businesses that are already suffering in some places because of the threat of a spillover from the conflict in neighboring Syria.

""It is like running an engine at less than full power. A three-day outage for Lebanon is like losing 10 percent of the country’s monthly productivity, especially for a service-based economy,"" CEO of private Internet provider Terranet Khaldoun Farhat said.

Farhat said the outage had been a large cost for his business. To keep providing Internet access, he has had to buy satellite bandwidth for four times the price he normally pays the government.

""This is one more disruption to economic activity that we don’t need,"" said Nassib Ghobril, chief economist at Byblos Bank Group. ""The telecoms sector needs to be reformed. It needs to be liberalized,"" he said.

Lebanon is famed for its entrepreneurs who persevere even during the depths of war but its snail-pace and costly Internet service has been an embarrassing blot on the economy.

Ookla, a company that tests Internet speeds around the world, has often ranked Lebanon last on its global Net Index, and the country has generally been lower down than many less developed nations such as Afghanistan and Burkina Faso.

Many blame Internet problems on a backwards policy which allocates the state-owned land-line provider Ogero 80 percent of the market, pushing out private companies. The state monopoly is a significant financier for the treasury, critics say.

Farhat says Lebanon is in dire need of a backup cable.

Cyprus lies between Lebanon and the damaged section of the cable but backup lines have kept its Internet working so it can provide help for Lebanon.

Saturday’s earthquake caused a rare failure along the fiber optic cables that supply Wrangell with its television, telephone, and Internet service.

“From Ketchikan, Wrangell, Petersburg, and up to Juneau, there’s a fiber that runs in that direction,” explains David Morris, spokesperson for GCI. “And then from Juneau it goes out into the Gulf of Alaska where it hits another fiber cable where it runs down and there’s another junction box that then breaks off and goes to Ketchikan. So that forms a ring. And the type of technology that we use, if there’s a break in any one location, the traffic is automatically routed in the other direction. And so, in theory, if you’ve got a single break, you don’t have disruption of service. What occurred here in Wrangell, though, is on the unusual side because you had multiple breaks at different locations. So that effectively isolated the island.”

Most services were restored in Wrangell late Saturday night. However, GCI customers will continue experiencing problems and will not have full cable television access until the broken cables are re-connected.

“So what the cable ship is doing is, they’ve sent an ROV—a remote operated vessel—down,” said Morris. “They’ve located the fiber cable. And now they’re in the process of trying to retrieve the cable. And they’ll buoy it off and then they’ll splice the sections together. And then full restoration of services will be effected in Wrangell.”

Google this month said it will build three new undersea cable routes to be completed in 2019, bringing to 11 the number of cables in which the company has invested since 2010.

Google's multimillion-dollar move isn't unusual anymore, even though undersea cable builds were historically driven by individual telecom operators or consortiums that then sold optical wavelength services to their customers.

The big four content providers -- Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook -- are increasingly financing undersea cable routes to enable fast, high-capacity data connections around the globe, particularly to locations where they have built data centers. Yet, these changes in the submarine networking market worry telecom operators that fear the big content providers have more money to invest in undersea cable, leaving the traditional players at a disadvantage.

Not only are 1 Gb, 10 Gb and 100 Gb wavelength service prices declining year over year, according to trend data from telecommunications research and consulting firm TeleGeography, but each time a new undersea cable goes live, 100 Gb wavelength prices drop quicker as more bandwidth becomes available at the high end of the market.

Yet, the news isn't all bad for telecom operators, according to Michael Bisaha, senior analyst at TeleGeography. Speaking at a recent webinar, he said the big content providers shouldn't always be viewed as competitors taking over the undersea market, because they aren't always financing entire cable builds. Moreover, content providers may finance only a portion of a cable, so telecom operators have opportunities to get onto a shared cable system and use that to stretch their investment capital, he said.

Content providers that have consistently invested in cable routes are on the routes where they have their major content hubs or cloud hubs, largely in the United States, Western Europe and some in Asia. But that doesn't mean they only need primary undersea routes. They still need diverse routes, and when their needs don't meet the threshold of investing in a whole cable, they might need wavelengths or shared spectrum to specific geographies that they may buy from a telecom operator, he added.

Apart from the influence content providers are having on the high end of the undersea cable market, the growing need for bandwidth is also driving the 10 Gb wavelength market, where prices dropped from 2014 through 2017 at an average compound annual rate of 20% to 25%, according to TeleGeography data. Bisaha said he expects the downward pricing trend to continue for both 10 Gb and 100 Gb wavelengths.

Even as 100 Gb wavelength prices drop, steeper shocks to the 100 Gb system tend to coincide with new content-provider-sponsored cables coming online. Increased participation of content companies influences the 100 Gb market more than in the 10 Gb or the 1 Gb markets.

Still, global undersea cable prices aren't falling uniformly in all areas. Less popular subsea routes may have higher transport rates than those for major hubs. ""While the range in different geographies may indeed continue to shrink, we don't expect them to completely disappear,"" Bisaha said.

Many enterprises are more dependent on undersea cables than they realize for remaining online and in business.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, focusing on the influence of large content providers on pricing and market dynamics.

KINSHASA - Africa's Internet users had something to celebrate this month. A total of 13 West African countries have just hooked up to a new underwater fiber optic cable running from Cape Town to London, bringing them better phone connections and a new high speed Internet link. But one country, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), missed the boat bringing the cable ashore.

Officially, the Democratic Republic Congo is about four months behind schedule to connect to the West African Cable System (WACS). This is not the first time the DRC has missed out on a high speed Internet link.

As Internet user Didier Bobange tries to download a document at his local cybercafé in Kinshasa, he has plenty of time to reflect on his country's position in the cyberspace race.

""So we don't know how long we wait for it to come…you know. I was in Benin Republic 10 years ago and the connection [there] was far better than we have here today in Kinshasa,"" recalled Bobange.

High speed Internet would be a blessing for Congo's businesses, researchers and even doctors who could make long distance diagnoses. It's past time they had it, says Laurent Ntumba, founder of the local Internet service provider Microcom.

""There are many [fiber optic] cables in Africa. There are maybe seven or eight, and we're not connected. It's unacceptable,"" said Ntumba.

In fact, he says, a fiber optic link between Muanda on the DRC's Atlantic coast and Kinshasa could have been switched on years ago.

""The cable from Muanda to Kinshasa [has] already [been installed] underground three years now - we can use it,"" added Ntumba.

But they cannot connect to the international line until the government has given permission, paid its dues to the cable consortium and builds a landing station at the coast. And, that is taking some time. It was a similar story in other countries, but the Congo has taken the longest time.

The immediate reason why the Congo is not linked to WACS is that the cable landing station was not built to the right standards. Local media report that the company contracted to build it had never done this kind of job before.

They also report that $3 million of government funds for the contract went missing last year and the former director-general of the national telecoms company, SCPT, was charged with high treason and jailed for three months in connection with the affair.

The scandal came to light after SCPT employees protested plans to create a private company, Congo Cable, to manage fiber optic connections.

Jean Paul Kamalata, a union representative for the telecoms sector, says this is unacceptable to cut out SCPT employees from the future revenues when they are already owed years in back pay. He also told said that the union has other valid concerns.

Kamalata says he campaigned against the plan to create Congo Cable because he believes international telecom links are vital to a country's security and you cannot entrust a country's security to a private company.

The government seems to have dropped the idea of creating a new company to manage the cable.

Microcom's Ntumba thinks it was not a bad idea in principle. He says the SCPT will need competent private sector partners to install and maintain the fiber optic network.

""Managing the cable is not something easy. You need to have the knowledge, you need all the support, and I don't know if the SCPT has this level of competence,"" Ntumba explained.

Ntumba is also doubtful about the government's plan for the next stage, which is to lay 2,000 kilometers of cable from Kinshasa to Lubumbashi in the southeast corner of the country. He suggests it would be quicker and cheaper to connect Lubumbashi to Zambia's fiber optic cable, and other eastern cities to cables from Rwanda and Uganda. The money saved could be spent on laying connections within big cities.

But many Congolese would oppose the idea of connecting eastern cities via Rwanda, a country that was at war with the DRC from 1998 to 2003.

The current director general of the SCPT, Placide Mbatika, said that deals have already been signed with Ex-Im Bank China and a Chinese contractor to lay the 2,000 kilometer cable, although there will still be a need for investors for subsequent phases.

Mbatika says the country is open to all investors for the fiber optic program. He says that thanks to President Joseph Kabila's intervention, SCPT now has political backing, competent management and a committed workforce. He predicts that the first phase of the project, landing the cable and connecting it to Kinshasa, will be finished by the end of August.

Local media say that any further delays could jeopardize the Congo's chances of hosting the next summit of French speaking countries, scheduled to be held in Kinshasa in October.","The article discusses the Democratic Republic of Congo's missed connection to the West African Cable System (WACS), an underwater fiber optic cable, and its implications for internet connectivity in the country.

"Severing of Channel Islands' Submarine Internet Lines","Three submarine fiber-optic cables cut, disrupting internet connectivity for the Channel Islands and prompting service provider responses.","https://www.digitaltrends.com/web/channel-islands-fiber-optic-cables-severed-united-kingdom","2016-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","By Kevin Parrish November 29, 2016",Yes,"Kevin Parrish","Portland, Oregon, United States",-,"2016-11-29","English","Digital Trends Media Group","**Three main internet lines linking the Channel Islands to the U.K. severed**

Earth’s human inhabitants have grown accustomed to a globally connected world. If their power goes out, their smartphone dies while out and about, or their broadband connection goes down, they are disconnected from the rest of the world and life immediately sucks. This worldwide network of connectivity is made possible by a spider web of undersea fiber-optic cables connecting the continents and islands together. But imagine what happens when those lines are cut.

The Channel Islands, which are located within the English Channel and off the coast of France, are feeling a disconnect from the rest of the world to some degree. The three main submarine fiber-optic cables pumping communications to the islands from the United Kingdom were completely severed, leaving the islands dependent on a single submarine cable linking them to France. Thus, the Channel Islands are still connected but will experience slow speeds for some time.

JT Global is the largest service provider for Jersey, which is one of the larger Channel Islands. The company stated on Tuesday that the disruption will continue “over the next week or so,” and believes that a ship dragging its anchor along the seabed is the culprit, which apparently cut a number of other submarine cables in the process. Thus, all communications to and from the Channel Islands will be pushed through the single line connected to France until the other lines are repaired.

“With all traffic now using this connection, customers may notice some impact on services,” the company said. “JT engineers have been working on the situation throughout the night, and have already mobilized the specialist team that repairs major undersea cables. It is not possible to get a precise time yet on when those cables will be repaired, but the work will be completed as soon as possible.”

The coastguard from Jersey is currently investigating the issue. Master Pilot Peter Moore told the BBC that on Monday night a boat anchored north of Alderney — the most northern island of the group — and is believed to be the King Arthur. Moore can’t confirm if the King Arthur was responsible for the damage or not. However, he noted that ships that travel the English Channel have charts of the area that show where they cannot fish or drop anchor.

Guernsey, which is the other large island of the group, apparently did not feel the same impact. The island’s largest communications service provider Sure said on Tuesday that it is working with JT Global to reroute the latter company’s data through its network. Sure’s customers only experienced problems with international voice calls, all other communication services were unaffected.

“Sure’s multi-million pound investment in the HUGO subsea cable infrastructure operated without fault, demonstrating our ability to provide leading telecommunication services despite an unprecedented incident such as this,” Sure stated. “Our engineering teams worked through the night to put in place measures to divert our voice traffic through the HUGO network as well as to provide specialist technical support and infrastructure to JT.”

The BBC said on Tuesday that JT Global, Sure, and BT Group expects the repairs to take up to three weeks. Meanwhile, Jersey Treasury Minister Senator Alan Maclean said that the party responsible for severing the submarine lines will be held accountable for the damage. Mediterranea di Navigazione, owners of the King Arthur, have yet to comment.","The article discusses the severing of three submarine fiber-optic cables linking the Channel Islands to the UK, detailing the implications for internet connectivity and the response from service providers.

"Undersea Cables: The Unseen Backbone of the Global Internet","100-150 undersea cables cut annually, causing major disruptions to global internet connectivity.","https://www.marinetechnologynews.com/news/undersea-cables-unseen-backbone-635742","2024-04-02T00:00:00.000Z","Robin Chataut",Yes,"Robin Chataut","Easton, Connecticut, United States","4950","2024-04-02","English","Marine Technology Reporter","**Undersea Cables: The Unseen Backbone of the Global Internet**  
Have you ever wondered how an email sent from New York arrives in Sydney in mere seconds, or how you can video chat with someone on the other side of the globe with barely a hint of delay? Behind these everyday miracles lies an unseen, sprawling web of undersea cables, quietly powering the instant global communications that people have come to rely on.
  
Undersea cables, also known as submarine communications cables, are fiber-optic cables laid on the ocean floor and used to transmit data between continents. These cables are the backbone of the global internet, carrying the bulk of international communications, including email, webpages and video calls. More than 95% of all the data that moves around the world goes through these undersea cables.
  
These cables are capable of transmitting multiple terabits of data per second, offering the fastest and most reliable method of data transfer available today. A terabit per second is fast enough to transmit about a dozen two-hour, 4K HD movies in an instant. Just one of these cables can handle millions of people watching videos or sending messages simultaneously without slowing down.
  
About 485 undersea cables totaling over 900,000 miles sit on the ocean floor. These cables span the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, as well as strategic passages such as the Suez Canal and isolated areas within oceans.
  
**Laying cable under the sea**  
Each undersea cable contains multiple optical fibers, thin strands of glass or plastic that use light signals to carry vast amounts of data over long distances with minimal loss. The fibers are bundled and encased in protective layers designed to withstand the harsh undersea environment, including pressure, wear and potential damage from fishing activities or ship anchors. The cables are typically as wide as a garden hose.
  
The process of laying undersea cables starts with thorough seabed surveys to chart a map in order to avoid natural hazards and minimize environmental impact. Following this step, cable-laying ships equipped with giant spools of fiber-optic cable navigate the predetermined route.
  
As the ship moves, the cable is unspooled and carefully laid on the ocean floor. The cable is sometimes buried in seabed sediments in shallow waters for protection against fishing activities, anchors and natural events. In deeper areas, the cables are laid directly on the seabed.
  
Along the route, repeaters are installed at intervals to amplify the optical signal and ensure data can travel long distances without degradation. This entire process can take months or even years, depending on the length and complexity of the cable route.
  
**Threats to undersea cables**  
Each year, an estimated 100 to 150 undersea cables are cut, primarily accidentally by fishing equipment or anchors. However, the potential for sabotage, particularly by nation-states, is a growing concern. These cables, crucial for global connectivity and owned by consortia of internet and telecom companies, often lie in isolated but publicly known locations, making them easy targets for hostile actions.
  
The vulnerability was highlighted by unexplained failures in multiple cables off the coast of West Africa on March 14, 2024, which led to significant internet disruptions affecting at least 10 nations. Several cable failures in the Baltic Sea in 2023 raised suspicions of sabotage.
  
The strategic Red Sea corridor has emerged as a focal point for undersea cable threats. A notable incident involved the attack on the cargo ship Rubymar by Houthi rebels. The subsequent damage to undersea cables from the ship’s anchor not only disrupted a significant portion of internet traffic between Asia and Europe but also highlighted the complex interplay between geopolitical conflicts and the security of global internet infrastructure.
  
**Protecting the cables**  
Undersea cables are protected in several ways, starting with strategic route planning to avoid known hazards and areas of geopolitical tension. The cables are constructed with sturdy materials, including steel armor, to withstand harsh ocean conditions and accidental impacts.
  
Beyond these measures, experts have proposed establishing “cable protection zones” to limit high-risk activities near cables. Some have suggested amending international laws around cables to deter foreign sabotage and developing treaties that would make such interference illegal.
  
The recent Red Sea incident shows that help for these connectivity challenges might lie above rather than below. After cables were compromised in the region, satellite operators used their networks to reroute internet traffic. Undersea cables are likely to continue carrying the vast majority of the world’s internet traffic for the foreseeable future, but a blended approach that uses both undersea cables and satellites could provide a measure of protection against cable cuts.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, including the fact that 100 to 150 cables are cut each year, primarily due to fishing activities and anchors.

The system went live in 2009, but Lebanon didn't join the network until the summer of 2011.

A severe internet outage that has hit several African countries - the third disruption in four months - is a stark reminder of how vulnerable the service is on the continent.

Questions are being asked about how the reliability of what has become an essential tool in nearly every aspect of life can be improved.

A cut to two of the undersea cables, which carry the data around the continent, early on Sunday morning, led to the recent disruption.

In March, damage to four cables off the West African coast caused similar problems.

And in February, the vital links were damaged in the Red Sea after the anchor of a stricken ship dragged through three cables.

Investigations are under way into this weekend’s case.

But it was also likely to have been caused by “an anchor drag” from a ship, Prenesh Padayachee, chief digital and operations officer at Seacom, which owns one of the two cables affected, told the BBC.

The second cable, known as Eassy, was affected at the same time and at the same place.

The incident happened off the South African coast, just north of the port city of Durban, according to the Communications Authority of Kenya (CAK).

The capacity of the infrastructure connecting Africa to the rest of the world has improved in recent years and telecoms companies are switching to other cables to maintain the service.

In Kenya, for example, the CAK said that local internet traffic was currently using The East Africa Marine System (Teams) cable that was not affected.

While Kenya has alternatives, other countries, such as Tanzania where connectivity levels hit 30% of what they were expected to be, do not.

The data should be able to find other routes, but when there is a limited number of pathways the service gets jammed and slows down.

In 2009 the Teams cable arrived in the Kenyan port of Mombasa bringing broadband connectivity to East Africa.

Cases of cable damage are increasing but that is because the number of connections has also gone up.

“A lot of people don’t realise that the internet is held up by these cables that are like garden hosepipes except it’s one that stretches 10,000km, and that means that they are quite fragile,” Dr Jess Auerbach Jahajeeah, a researcher into digital connectivity at the University of Cape Town, told the BBC’s Focus on Africa programme.

Anchor dragging from ships close to shore is one of the most common causes of damage, but underwater rockfalls, as was believed to be the case in West Africa in March, and seismic activity can also affect the cables.

As “many of these subsea cables are often quite close to each other, then one activity on the ocean floor or one ship can damage multiple cables at the same time”, industry expert Ben Roberts said.

Repairing the damage, which requires specialised equipment and expertise, can take days or weeks, depending on the weather, sea conditions and the extent of the problem.

It took more than a month, for example, for the four severed West African internet cables to be repaired and returned to service.

“We are working on a temporary capacity solution to ensure connectivity is reinstated to the affected regions,” said Mr Padayachee from Seacom.

He added that they were “actively collaborating with various parties to expedite the repair process”.

Cable repair ship the Léon Thévenin, that had been docked in Cape Town, is being sent to the site of the damage and should be there in three days, said Chris Wood, who runs a company that has invested in Eassy.

An internet connection has become vital for all types of businesses across the continent.

Despite an increase in connections, Africa's reliance on a limited number of undersea cables for the internet makes the continent more susceptible to disruptions and exacerbates their impact.

Europe and North America, on the other hand, have a dense network of high-capacity overland and undersea cables that diversify connectivity routes and improve resilience.

While discussions have been ongoing to address Africa's internet infrastructure challenges, progress has been slow because of logistical and financial constraints.

Dr Jahajeeah said one problem was that the support systems to repair the growing number of cables around the continent had not kept up with the growth.

While other ships can help out, the Léon Thévenin is the only repair ship dedicated to servicing Africa.

“The [ship] used to do two or three repairs a year [but] last year it did nine… and there is a real need for African governments and global governments to get together and say we need to ensure that there is no digital divide,” Dr Jahajeeah said.

Some people have proposed alternatives such as satellite internet links to bolster digital resilience.

Elon Musk's Starlink project, for example, aims to provide high-speed internet to people who live in remote areas via a network of satellites. But is very expensive and currently not available everywhere.

The answer really lies in greater investment on the ground to support the vital communications infrastructure.

“It needs more networks, more connectivity, more data centres and more internet exchanges to make sure that we have a diverse connectivity,” said Mr Roberts.","The article discusses the impact of cut undersea cables on internet connectivity in Africa, detailing specific incidents of cable damage and their consequences.

""It is not true that the state cut the Internet,"" Information Minister Omran al-Zoabi told state television. ""The terrorists targeted the Internet lines, resulting in some regions being cut off.""

But doubt has been cast on that explanation by networking experts.

""Syria has 4 physical cables that connect it to the rest of the Internet,"" wrote Matthew Prince, CEO of CloudFlare, in a blog on tech site Gizmodo. ""Three are undersea cables that land in the city of Tartous, Syria. The fourth is an over-land cable through Turkey. In order for a whole-country outage, all four of these cables would have had to been cut simultaneously. That is unlikely to have happened.""

""The systematic way in which [network] routes were withdrawn suggests that this was done through updates in [regime] router configurations,"" he added, ""not through a physical failure or cable cut.""

Meanwhile, fighting around the Damascus International Airport grounded all flights Thursday into Friday and prevented any from coming in.

The airport road was reportedly reopened on Friday afternoon and the head of Syria's Civil Aviation Authority said the airport was operating ""as usual,"" according to the Associated Press.

But State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland told reporters that ""fierce fighting"" had kept the airport closed on Friday. An official from Royal Jordanian, national airline of neighboring Jordan, also told ABC News that no flights were going in or out of Damascus, and flight tracking website Flightradar24.com showed no planes over Syrian airspace on Friday night.","The article discusses Syria's internet blackout and mentions that 'Syria has 4 physical cables that connect it to the rest of the Internet,' with 'three are undersea cables that land in the city of Tartous, Syria.' It explains that for a complete blackout, all cables would need to be cut simultaneously, which is unlikely.

The discussion about the undersea cables is central to understanding the blackout's cause and implications, thereby satisfying the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables."

India is an attractive gateway location due to its location, geopolitical situation, and saturation in parts of Asia. Due to rapid infrastructure and surging cloud growth, India is becoming a growing epicenter for internet traffic between Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. In line with this, the Indian Finance Minister’s concession was music to the ears. In the interim Union Budget 2024, announced by the Finance Minister on February 1, 2024 customs duty exemption was granted to vessels engaged in laying submarine cables, that lapses on March 31, 2024, was extended up to September 30, 2024. Telecom companies depend heavily on submarine cables for the high-speed transfer of data around the globe.

India’s strategic and geographic position in the Indian Ocean region has made it a critical player in the development of submarine cable infrastructure. The country is connected to the world (Asia, Middle East, Europe & Africa) through multiple submarine cable systems, such as the Southeast Asia-Middle East-Western Europe (SEA-ME-WE) cable system, the Bay of Bengal Gateway (BBG) cable system, and the India-Middle East-Western Europe (IMEWE) cable system, etc.

2024 is set to see a number of highly anticipated submarine cable systems worldwide go live this year. The submarine cable systems market estimated at USD 18.28 billion in 2023, at a CAGR of 12.3 percent is expected to be USD 33.29 billion in 2028.

Submarine cable systems carry over 99 percent of intercontinental communication traffic, making them the invisible enabler of global connectivity. Growing investment in high-speed internet infrastructure is driving the growth of the submarine optical fiber cable market. The continuous increase in the generation and transfer of vast amounts of data worldwide is one of the primary drivers of the market.

The high installation and maintenance costs are expected to challenge the market’s growth. Furthermore, the growing investment in satellite communications is another major factor challenging growth, as cables only have an advantage over short paths, especially if traffic is heavy. However, satellites become economically more attractive as distance increases and density decreases. Additionally, having a satellite communication link is much faster, as with the other wireless deployments, than deploying submarine cables, which is another significant advantage of satellite communications over submarine optical fiber cables.

In the Indian region, part of four new cable systems – 2Africa, IAX, IEX, and PEACE – are all planned to go live in 2024. Taken together with their existing cable projects, these new systems will create an interconnected backbone for international data traffic, bolstering these transport routes between Asia and the rest of the world for years to come.

2Africa is expected to be operational in 2024, with the PEARLS branch – which extends the system to Oman, the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Iraq, Pakistan, India, and Saudi Arabia – planned for service in 2025. Airtel is part of this where it has a wide-ranging partnership with Meta, covering subsea cable systems to bring 2Africa Pearls to its landing station in Mumbai. The telco planned to partner with Meta and Saudi Telecom in the venture of 2Africa Pearls extending to India.

While the India Asia Xpress (IAX) cable, expected to be ready for service later this year, and the India Europe Xpress (IEX) system, which will be ready next year. IAX will stretch from Mumbai, India, to the Maldives, and onwards to Singapore, with additional branches extending to Thailand and Sri Lanka. IEX, meanwhile, will travel westwards from Mumbai, through the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, before landing at its final destination in Savona, Italy. Reliance Jio is partners with IAX and IEX.

Occupying a crucial junction for international data traffic, linking Southeast Asia to Europe, India is a major data hub in its own right. Both APAC and Europe are already highly developed when it comes to submarine cable infrastructure, but the sheer scale of the data growth expected over the coming decade is making the further development of these state-of-the-art cables highly attractive. IAX and IEX will play a major role in meeting that need, offering customers alternatives on some of the most popular data routes in the world.

In addition, a number of new international submarine cables are in pipeline for rollout, including MIST, and TEAS, etc.

MIST, aka the Myanmar/Malaysia India Singapore Transit cable system, has a total length of 8,100km and connects Singapore, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Mumbai and Chennai in India. It is being constructed by NEC Corporation. Once fully deployed, the cable is expected to reach 11,000km and have the capacity for future expansion.

TEAS, Trans Europe Asia System is a trans-regional network that seamlessly links two new diverse connections across the Arabian Peninsula that are designed to support the future needs of key data centers, linking India, the Middle East and Europe.

NEC Corporation India (NEC India) together with NEC Corporation in January 2024 has successfully completed its optical submarine cable system in Southern India connecting Kochi and the Lakshadweep Islands. Spanning approximately 1,870 kilometres the order was awarded with a project by BSNL.

Currently, there are 17 international subsea cables (Seacom and MENA are considered separate cables) landing in 14 distinct cable landing stations in 5 cities across India, in Mumbai, Chennai, Cochin, Tuticorin and Trivandrum, and the lit capacity and the activated capacity on these 17 international subsea cables were 138.606Tbps and 111.111Tbps respectively.

There are also domestic submarine cables such as the Chennai-Andaman and Nicobar Island Cable (CANI) connecting Port Blair along with seven other Islands of Andaman & Nicobar, and the Kochi-Lakshadweep Island (KLI) cable system for a direct communication link through a dedicated submarine optical fiber cable between Kochi and 11 islands of Lakshadweep.

In a move to ease the rules for setting up submarine (undersea) cable landing stations (CLS) in India, the TRAI has made recommendations on the licensing framework and regulatory mechanism for submarine cables landing in India within existing UL-ILD/standalone ILD license, visit, [https://trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/Recommendation_19062023.pdf](https://trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/Recommendation_19062023.pdf)

The protection of subsea infrastructure is a growing concern. Recent disruptions either through sabotage, espionage, manipulation, or sheer accident highlight the issue and require legislative and physical protection in the Indian Ocean region.

Currently, India has 17 submarine cables landing from different parts of the world. However, India currently lacks jurisdictional, legislative, and physical protection measures for these expensive and vulnerable underwater assets. India needs to create Submarine Cable Protection Zone within India’s Exclusive Economic Zone, that is consistent with the international maritime laws, provided under UNCLOS.

A solid legislative framework would enable India to use its maritime law enforcement within these zones, as well as jurisdictional capacities for the arrest and prosecution of wrongdoers. In terms of physical protection, the repair of damaged cables is an expensive and skilled task. The rather difficult task of monitoring and protecting submarine assets in the Indian Ocean Region not only requires technical expertise but also a policy framework to ensure physical safeguards are backed up by legislation.

It will take three weeks to repair the damage. In the meantime, the Internet in Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Juba, the capital of South Sudan, is functioning at a reduced speed. It will impede the normal flow by about 20 percent, according to the BBC's Nairobi correspondent, Noel Mwakugu.

The Indian Ocean East Africa Marine Systems (TEAMS) cable, which connects East Africa to the United Arab Emirates, was severed when a ship dropped anchor in a restricted area – restricted because of the presence of the sea cabling. The Teams cable was carrying redirected traffic from the earlier cutting of three other cables in the Red Sea, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The outage comes at a time when Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, has assumed a much greater profile as a center of technological innovation and entrepreneurship, largely due to the recent availability of fast, reliable broadband connections. These undersea fiber-optic cables, laid in 2009 and which connect Africa to the world, have kicked off Kenya's high-tech industry and prompted an increase in Kenyan Internet users from 1.8 million to 3.1 million in the first year.

Bitenge Ndemo, Kenya's permanent secretary in the Ministry of Information and Communications, says that the cost of the internet outage could reach $500 million by the time repairs are finished.

""We do not have the cost yet but it runs into millions of dollars since TEAMS and EASSY carry almost 70 percent of the traffic from the East African Region,"" Mr. Ndemo told the Monitor. ""Most providers had cut off satellite thinking we have sufficient redundancy,"" Ndemo adds, and the Kenyan government has urged other new cable lines to land elsewhere to prevent future line cuts in the high-traffic sea-lanes outside Mombasa.

In the meantime, Kenya's losses have been significant. ""There have been major disruptions and loss of revenue in the past few days,"" Ndemo says. ""In my estimation we shall have lost up to $500 million by the time we are reconnected.""

Jessica Colaço, the manager of iHub, a high-tech incubator in Nairobi, estimates that the cut in Internet service will affect an estimated 10,000 people in Nairobi who work in the tech industry. All of those people, along with larger companies who have started to locate in the city -- such as Google, Microsoft, and Samsung -- will suffer the frustration of a substantial slow-down until the cable is repaired.

In addition to work taking longer, and therefore costing more, a slowing in the rate of information carried online could also cause multiple websites and online services to ""time out.” A time out is a limit on the duration allowed for an online instruction to be followed and is configured on a server-by-server or client-by-client basis. A time out will require a user to begin the process of retrieval again (and again). In many cases, users will never access the information at all, bringing work to a standstill for the duration of the repair.

“It is difficult to make an exact analysis [of the effects], because one cannot be sure about the amount of redundancy that is built into most of the operator networks to deal with something like this,” Paul Kukubo, CEO of Kenya’s ICT Board, said by email. “As we write this I am able to communicate because my service provider obviously has another network to route through.

“But the visible effects are that there has been a considerable slowdown on some Internet network speeds. Some service providers have been affected in terms of quality due to this, especially because the TEAMS networks provide high speed broadband that many have come to depend on. We have seen some slowdown on some government networks as well,” Mr. Kukubo said. “The providers assure us that this is a rare occurrence and because East Africa has 3 cable connections, and one was unaffected by the cut, we are lucky to have this redundancy on our undersea cables.

Computer users are used to the Internet malfunctioning, of course. But for most, malfunctions rarely can be traced to a single act of negligence, or greed, by a named individual. The Mombasa anchor episode, in this sense, resembles an incident in which an Armenian retiree in the Caucasian nation of Georgia brought down the Internet. Hayastan Shakarian, a retiree living in Georgia, wound up cutting the connection to three Caucasian countries with a shovel while searching for copper wiring to steal in the hills.

As with the shovel incident, the Mombasa anchor incident is an unwelcome reminder that the high-minded world of technology remains vulnerable to physical human error.

TEAMS is owned by the Kenyan government, in conjunction with Etelisat, an Emirati company.

By Gareth van Zyl, Editor, ITWeb Africa  
Johannesburg, 29 Feb 2012  

Damage to undersea broadband cable Eassy is likely to be repaired by 20 March, says the chief executive of a company that is the largest shareholder in the network.  

The 10 000km Eassy cable, which stretches from Sudan to SA, suffered a cut on 17 February between Djibouti and Port Sudan, says Chris Wood, CEO of West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC), which has an almost 30% stake in the network.  

Wood says the rest of the cable is still functioning because its “collapsed loop network configuration” allows for the internal re-routing of traffic when a break occurs. The WIOCC chief executive also says the fault on Eassy did not have “much impact” on its customers either, as the vast majority of its data traffic exits Africa through Djibouti.  

However, it was not only the Eassy cable that was sliced.  

The SMW3 and EIG networks, used by Eassy to carry traffic from Africa to Europe, were damaged just north of Djibouti in what appears to have been part of a single incident.  

“It is believed that a cargo ship dragged its anchor over a distance of some 150km in the Red Sea, cutting all three cables one after the other,” notes Wood.  

“Most Eassy owners also own capacity on other systems and have in-built redundancy in their networks. As such, most of the Africa to Europe traffic affected by the cuts to SMW3 and EIG has already been re-routed onto other systems, both in Djibouti and via South Africa,” Wood adds.  

WIOCC says the SMW3 cable could be repaired by 12 March, a fix that could restore most of the affected traffic on its direct path to Europe. The company also says the EIG cable could be repaired by the same date as the Eassy cable, 20 March.  

### Piracy threat?  

The damage to all three cables, though, occurred in and around the area of the Red Sea, which has experienced problems of piracy - a factor that could potentially delay repair times, according to experts.  

“It's a very dangerous spot to ever park a ship,” says JP Viljoen, a systems engineer at Neology, a wholesale bandwidth provider to ISPs in Africa.  

The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Commercial Crime Services said on 15 February it received information that in the Bab El Mandeb Straits of the Red Sea “seven pirates in two skiffs... chased a chemical tanker”. The ICC Commercial Crime Services also said that in the same area of the Red Sea, on 27 February, the crew of a bulk carrier in the strait reported sightings of nine skiffs approaching their boat aggressively.  

On both occasions, the alleged pirates aborted their attacks, according to the reports.  

But Mike Last, director for marketing and international business development at WIOCC, says: “I don't think piracy is an issue with this.”  

He notes that the time-scale of the planned repair is dependent on issues such as securing permits, sailing time and weather conditions. He says a ship from the Middle East is going to be sent to fix the cable. He did not specify when that ship would be sent exactly.  

### Destructive anchors  

Meanwhile, reports have emerged in the last few days that The East African Marine System (TEAMS) 5 000km undersea fibre-optic cable, stretching from Kenya to the United Arab Emirates, was also cut by a ship's anchor in the Kenyan port of Mombasa.  

The disruption caused a 20% slowdown in Internet speeds in Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, Ethiopia and South Sudan, the BBC reported.  

Wood says the Eassy cable is functioning normally from Mombasa.  

He adds that some TEAMS owners are in the process of re-routing their traffic onto the Eassy system in Mombasa, to reduce the impact in Kenya and other countries in East Africa while the repair to TEAMS is undertaken.","The article discusses the cutting of three undersea cables, specifically mentioning the Eassy, SMW3, and EIG cables.

Preliminary submarine cable prospectus released on 5th July. RCOM released the preliminary prospectus for the listing of its cable assets as a business trust in Singapore last week. At this stage, the pricing hasn’t been determined, but press articles indicate a pricing range of USD 1.09-1.32 per unit, with an implied market cap of USD 1.27-1.54 billion. The prospectus states a payout of at least 90% of distributable free cash in dividends and projects USc 12.5 for FY13F. This implies a 9.5%-11.5% yield at the offer price indicated as per press, which is attractive vs the average telco yield of 6-7% across the region. However, this pricing range also implies a listing EV/EBITDA of ~10-12x FY13F (on pro-forma EBITDA forecast of USD 131 million with no debt at end of FY12F). Hence, we recommend some caution, and also given the lack of clarity/ inconsistency around group strategy, a ~10% yield alone may not be enough to entice many investors. We are, in general, positive on submarine cable businesses given their inherent cash/margin potential, but we don’t have enough comparables/ details to assess the merits of this transaction yet.

Positive catalyst, but only the first step to deleveraging. A listing of its submarine cables assets could be a positive catalyst for RCOM given its many attempts to monetize its various assets. However, if we assume a 65% divestment in cables (or roughly USD 1 billion proceeds based on price indicated by press), and these proceeds are used to reduce debt at RCOM level, gearing still remains high at close to 5x on our estimates.

**Key highlights from the preliminary prospectus**
- RCOM has created the Global Telecommunications Infrastructure Trust (GTI Trust), which now owns the submarine cable assets. This trust released the preliminary prospectus for an IPO listing in Singapore.
- Total number of units after the IPO is expected to be 1,163 million and RCOM could potentially look to divest 55-65%, we understand, based on press reports, which highlight a price range of USD 1.09-1.32 per unit. This implies a market cap in the range of USD 1.27-1.54 billion.
- As per the prospectus, the trust expects to at least distribute 90% of cash flows to unit holders. For FY13F, USc 12.5 per unit is estimated to be distributed. This implies a yield in the range of 9.5-11.5%, based on above mentioned unit price range. However, these are preliminary estimates at this stage and are also subject to actual performance of the company (share price).
- As per pro forma statements, GTI Trust has no debt as of March 2012. This would imply a FY13F EV/EBITDA multiple of 10-12x (based on FY13F pro forma projections provided in the prospectus). This compares to the current regional average of 6-7x.

We believe a 55-65% divestiture could reduce RCOM’s debt levels by USD 700 million-1 billion. RCOM’s net debt at the end of March quarter stood at USD 6.5 billion, with net debt-to-EBITDA of 5.5x. If we assume USD 1 billion in proceeds were to be used to lower debt, we estimate net debt to EBITDA could fall close to 5x.","The article discusses RCOM's submarine cable assets in detail, mentioning them directly and treating them as a central theme.

Johannesburg, 22 Feb 2012  

Undersea broadband cable Eassy, which connects countries along Eastern Africa to high-speed Internet, has been damaged, resulting in minor service disruption.

The 10 000km cable, stretching from Sudan to SA, experienced a cut between Djibouti and Port Sudan, according to Chris Wood, chief executive of West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC), the largest shareholder in Eassy with a 30% stake.

He further says the fault has only resulted in minimal disruption owing to Eassy's collapsed ring protection system that allows for internal re-routing of traffic.

A WIOCC representative further told ITWeb that the company is currently not in a position to give an exact date for when the repair of the fault is to be completed.

“The only services affected are those either originating or terminating in Port Sudan, or those using Port Sudan to connect to other systems for transit to Europe.

“As the vast majority of Eassy's traffic exits through Djibouti, most customers have not felt the impact of the cut to Eassy,” Wood adds.

Africa's growing number of undersea cables means incidents of service disruptions, especially as a result of ships dropping anchors on cables, are increasing.

Two years ago, Africa's Seacom undersea cable, which also connects the east coast of Africa, experienced a similar cut that took almost three weeks to repair.

With more undersea broadband cables connecting Africa having come online, such as the West Africa Cable System, businesses that rely on the networks say they are mitigating service disruption risks by using a number of different cables.

Graham Beneke, systems engineer at Neology, wholesale bandwidth provider to ISPs in Africa, says the latest Eassy cut has not really affected his company's operations. “We have capacity on all the other undersea cables as well.

“By having one cable running up the east coast, and by having one cable running up the west coast, the same ship is unlikely to cause a fault on both cables simultaneously,” he adds.","The article titled 'Eassy cable damaged' provides a detailed discussion on the damage to the Eassy undersea cable, including its location and the implications for internet service in the region.

It mentions the cut specifically, discusses the minor service disruptions caused, and compares this incident to past events involving other undersea cables, thus providing context and relevance to the topic of cut sea cables.

This aligns well with the evaluation criteria, as it treats the subject as a central theme rather than a minor mention."

In seven East African countries, internet connectivity has been severely disrupted. The cause: an anchor that crashed onto an undersea cable in Kenya's port of Mombasa.

**KAMPALA _taz_** | These days, anyone going to the bank in East Africa to pay bills must be patient: ""Sorry, our system works over the internet and it's very slow these days,"" sighs the bank employee. ""We apologize for the inconvenience,"" numerous telecommunications companies in East Africa explain in emails and text messages to their customers. Twitter and Facebook users from Burundi to South Sudan are vocally complaining about the slowness of their internet connections. Watching YouTube videos is nearly impossible.

The reason: one of the broadband cables connecting East Africa to the world is damaged. Last Saturday, a ship dropped anchor outside the port of Mombasa. At a depth of four kilometers, the heavy hook crashed onto the cable laid in 2009. Six countries went completely offline. Even phone calls and SMS were not functioning in Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and South Sudan for hours.

East African telecommunications companies had to switch their systems back to satellite connections. Since then, websites open only in slow motion – at about 20% of the previous speed, similar to three years ago when East Africa was not connected to the undersea cable.

Repairing the cable will take up to three weeks, explained Joel Tanui, manager of the East Africa Marine System (TEAMS), which operates the cable. It belongs to a consortium of several globally operating telecommunications companies and the Kenyan government. TEAMS plans to deploy remotely operated submarines to lift and repair the cable.

**Three Undersea Cables Connect Africa**

The damaged cable is one of three undersea cables connecting East Africa to the global network: it runs from the port of Mombasa in Kenya to Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates. Over the past two years, broadband connections have been laid from Mombasa into the interior of the continent: to Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and South Sudan – where national network operators are currently expanding connections to remote villages.

The EASSY cable, which runs parallel in some sections, extends from Sudan's port city of Port Sudan along the East African coast to South Africa, connecting the East and Southern African countries as well as Madagascar to the TEAMS cable. Ten days before the anchor accident in Mombasa, the EASSY cable was also damaged in the Red Sea.

The third cable, SEACOM, stretches from Zafarana to Egypt's capital Cairo and the Horn of Africa. From there, one strand goes to the Indian port city of Mumbai and the other along the east coast to South Africa. The TEAMS cable connects to the SEACOM connection. The SEACOM operating company has recently issued press releases to clarify that their connection has not been disrupted. Numerous telecommunications companies are currently trying to reroute their connections through the SEACOM cable.

Since the undersea cables went online in 2009, much has changed rapidly in East Africa. Transferring large amounts of data has become possible in a short time. This has greatly boosted the economy. Internet cafes are opening on every corner in East Africa. Restaurants and bars offer free Wi-Fi. In Rwanda, one can even access the internet nationwide via Wi-Fi.

The governments of East Africa – led by Rwanda – have developed ambitious IT strategies, with ministers and institutions tweeting. However, the incident with the undersea cable now shows that this boom can be brought to a halt in seconds by a single anchor.","The article titled 'Internet-Ausfall in Ostafrika: Ein Anker stört den Boom' provides a detailed account of an incident where an anchor from a ship damaged an undersea cable in Mombasa, Kenya.

This event led to severe internet connectivity issues across seven East African countries, including Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and South Sudan.

The article discusses the implications of this incident, such as the disruption of internet services and telecommunications, as well as the ongoing efforts to repair the cable.

It emphasizes the significance of undersea cables for internet connectivity in the region, stating that the damaged cable is one of three that connect East Africa to the global network.

Therefore, the article satisfies the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables as it treats this incident as a central theme."

In East Africa, the Internet has slowed to a crawl thanks to a disruption of the telecommunications pipeline serving the region. Over the weekend, a ship dragging an anchor severed one of the three undersea data cables linking countries that include Kenya, Rwanda and Ethiopia to the Middle East and Europe. It may take about three weeks to fix. Audie Cornish talks to Solomon Moore, East Africa correspondent for the _Wall Street Journal_.  

In East Africa, Internet and telecommunications services have hit a snag - literally. A few days ago, a ship dragging its anchor severed an underwater fiber-optic cable carrying data from Kenya to United Arab Emirates. The result: Internet and mobile phone outages for people in more than half a dozen countries up and down the coast. And it's not the first time one of these data pipelines has taken a hit. Here to talk more about the incident and the underwater world of data is Solomon Moore. He's the East Africa correspondent for the Wall Street Journal. He's based in Nairobi. Welcome to the program.  

SOLOMON MOORE: Thank you.  

CORNISH: What more can you tell us about what happened here?  

MOORE: Kenyan officials say that a ship was dragging its anchor off the coast of Mombasa, Kenya, and severed an Internet and phone link that hits land at that point and then goes under the sea and connects Africa to the rest of the world via Internet and phone.  

CORNISH: And I gather that this isn't the first time.  

MOORE: This isn't the first time that a cable such as this has been cut, but what is unusual about this situation is that this particular cable - it's called the TEAMS cable. It's The East African Marine Systems. Internet traffic and phone traffic was being rerouted through this line because, 10 days earlier on February 17th, three other crucial cables were also severed in a different place off the coast of Djibouti.  

CORNISH: This cable was just a few years old, but there are all kinds like it all over the world connecting places, you know, as far as New York and France, Colombia and Florida. Describe how these pipelines work, maybe what they look like.  

MOORE: So these are not the kinds of cables that you'd see kind of lining the road. These are undersea cables. They're coiled in kind of a steel armor. They're fiber optic, each strand of fiber optic wire about the diameter of a human hair, and they're capable of carrying millions of phone calls and data connections at once.  

And they're unspooled by cable ships across the ocean floor. The depth of these cables is the main thing that protects them, but also the armor that they're sheathed in.  

CORNISH: Solomon, how has this affected life there? I mean, it seems to somehow showcase how fragile this infrastructure is.  

MOORE: Well, you know, these things happen. I mean, cables have been severed before. When the tsunami hit Japan, that resulted in Internet cables being severed. It's disrupted a lot of commerce here. Africa is not as wired as many parts of the world, but more and more businesses are sprouting up. Some of the most prominent businesses on the continent are involved in eCommerce and rely on these Internet and phone connections for millions of links with the world outside of Africa and within the continent.  

CORNISH: Lastly, how soon will this underwater cable be repaired? And how do they actually go about doing it?  

MOORE: What we're being told is it's going to be three weeks of slow Internet, intermittent service, a lot of cost to businesses that need the Internet and these phone links. What that entails - the repair will entail ships going to these areas where the wires have been severed, submerging submarines, unmanned submarines, to go down and inspect these cables. Then submarines to bring them up to the surface, where they'll be reattached in a clean environment aboard these cable ships.  

Then they'll be submerged again and, hopefully, everything will be back in working order in about three weeks' time.  

CORNISH: Solomon Moore, thank you so much for talking with us.  

MOORE: You're welcome.

Here's one measure that gives a rough idea of how difficult it would be for your government to legally shut down the Internet.

First, it should be explained that the cutoffs in Syria and Egypt weren't the result of a physical disconnection, like bombing the cables or cutting the power to servers or relay stations. A country can take itself off the map largely by removing itself from the Domain Name System and Border Gateway Patrol, the software and databases that tell computers and servers how to contact one another.

In other words, a ""kill switch"" for the Internet might be as simple a thing as directing DNS providers to delist or send false information (more easily done when they are run by the state), which could isolate the country from the rest of the online world with a few keystrokes, and restore it just as easily. This method is consistent with the way in which Syria dropped offline, although a government spokesperson has reportedly claimed that the rebel faction was responsible and had cut the cables.

Renesys, an Internet monitoring and analysis company that provided insight during the disconnection of Egypt, gathered some data on how resistant different countries are to a wide-scale shutdown. The company says that one way of measuring the robustness of a country's networks is by looking at the number of Internet service providers (ISPs) that have direct connections to other ISPs outside of the country. The more external connections, the more resistant the country is to shutdown.

Larger countries, of course, have more ISPs, for example, with one serving the North, one serving only the big cities, one primarily working with businesses, etc. But smaller countries and those with totalitarian or unstable regimes may have very few, or even just one official ""outside line.""

The submarine cables connecting Syria with neighboring countries. Again, this doesn't necessarily mean physical lines; many ISPs may share the same fiber backbone that connects, say, Greece and Turkey. If two ISPs share a line and only one is forced to cease operating, in most cases the other can keep working. On the other hand, if multiple lines are under the authority of just one provider, that makes shutdowns far easier.

Countries with only one or two ""frontier"" providers include Libya, Ethiopia, Myanmar and, unsurprisingly, Syria. Places like Greenland and Madagascar are also at risk: Their geographic isolation and smaller populations make multiple external connections difficult and in some ways unnecessary.

On the other side there are the countries that should be highly resistant to shutdown: the United States, Canada, most of Europe, and Australia number among the 32 countries with 40 or more frontier providers. So while Americans may understandably be concerned with issues like Net Neutrality and monopolistic practices, it would be comparatively difficult for the government to cut off the country from the rest of the world.

This is only one way to look at risk and security, however. Physical infrastructure could also be destroyed or rendered inoperable in several ways and at several points. While this method is far less likely to be used by governments (which have likely invested in that very infrastructure), an attacker would feel no such compunction in bombing a transatlantic cable or removing power to a major switch facility.

The outage in Syria is ongoing; Renesys and other Internet companies like Akamai are monitoring and reporting on the state of the country's connectivity, which no doubt depends heavily on the outcome of the current armed conflict.","The article discusses the implications of internet shutdowns in Syria and mentions 'submarine cables' in the context of Syria's connectivity.

Ars looks at how Egypt ""turned off"" the Internet within its borders and …

How hard is it, exactly, to kill the Internet? Egypt seems to have been able to do it. But Egypt's situation isn't exactly the same as that in the Western world. And even though Egypt only has four big ISPs, the fact that everything went down after midnight local time suggests that it took considerable effort to accomplish the 'Net shut-off. After all, it seems unlikely that President Hosni Mubarak ordered the Internet to be shut down as he went to bed; such a decision must have been made earlier in the day, and then taken hours to execute.

Also, the fact that such a drastic measure was deemed necessary may indicate that more targeted measures, such as blocking Twitter, didn't get the job done. This nuclear option was intended to make online coordination of anti-government action impossible; at the same time, the mushroom cloud may give protesters hope that their efforts are not in vain.

### Cables and routing

The easiest way to disconnect a country from the Internet is to cut the cables that leave the country. Egypt has a bunch of sea cables that go across the Mediterranean to Italy, and a few others that visit other Mediterranean destinations. Other cables run through the Red Sea towards east Africa and in the direction of India and beyond.

Interestingly, it doesn't look like the connections that run through Egypt have been affected. The fact that traffic between Europe and Asia is unaffected means the fiber optic cables themselves weren't cut.

The only thing we know for sure is that quite suddenly, almost all the Egyptian IP address ranges fell off the 'Net. This means that routers no longer know where to send packets addressed to IP addresses that fall within these prefixes—even if all the cables are still working fine.

However, it seems unlikely that the Egyptian ISPs removed 3,500 prefixes, if only because that means removing 3,500 lines from router configurations. An easier way would be to make a filter that simply doesn't allow any outgoing BGP advertisements.

When the border routers are turned off or lose their connection to the outside world, an ISP's network becomes isolated from the rest of the world. However, that doesn't necessarily mean local connectivity is disrupted.

To really make it impossible for any two users of the same ISP to talk to each other, it's necessary to shut down—or at least disable the routing protocols—on every router.

Of course just being able to talk to people that are connected to the same ISP as you isn't that useful—especially if there's no DNS. Turns out that there are three DNS root servers in Egypt, so there is a possibility that they could keep internal connectivity going without relying on the outside world.

But obviously, keeping local connectivity up and running would defeat the purpose. Unlike BGP and IS-IS/OSPF, the DNS in general provides a nice central place where it's easy to disrupt the network.

### Could this happen elsewhere?

In many medium-sized countries, killing the connections between ISPs wouldn't be too hard. In the US, this would be quite difficult. Assuming someone in high places has an Internet kill switch, shutting down just the international connections would require a lot of manual work. The old story that the Internet was built as a military network to withstand nuclear attacks is pretty much an urban legend, but despite that, it's surprisingly hard to kill. It can be done, however, if you're a government and you try really, really hard.","The article discusses the importance of sea cables in maintaining Internet connectivity, specifically mentioning Egypt's undersea cables to Italy and other Mediterranean destinations.

NEC has broken the ultra-long haul internet speed record by transmitting 1.15 terabits per second with a single laser over a distance of 10,000km (6,213 miles). In total, four lasers were used simultaneously to transmit 4Tbps down a single optic fiber.

Unfortunately NEC's press release is light on details, but it seems like the engineers used fairly standard tech to achieve this new speed record. Each laser encodes its data using orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) superchannels (the same technique used by DSL, WiFi, and more), and then four of these ""superchannels"" are multiplexed into a single cable using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). The novel innovation here is probably the use of OFDM with optical signals. The work was carried out by NEC's research group in Princeton, New Jersey, which is close to the landing point of numerous transatlantic cables.

Faster speeds have been transmitted over fiber in recent years, but only over very short distances. The significance here is the distance of NEC's transmission speed record: 10,000km is long enough to span the Atlantic or Pacific. Submarine cables are incredibly expensive and difficult to lay, and where possible, you want to make the most of existing infrastructure instead of laying a new cable -- which is exactly what NEC's technology promises to do.

The current state-of-the-art for transoceanic connectivity is between 10 and 100Gbps per optical fiber. The fattest cable in the world, the TGN-P which spans the Pacific between Japan and the USA, currently maxes out at around 7Tbps, which means it has around 150 ""lit"" fibers. The key behind NEC's discovery is that it can be used on existing fiber optic networks -- and so in this case, if the routers on either end of TGN-P were upgraded with NEC's technology, the cable's total capacity would jump from 7Tbps to 150Tbps or more.","The article discusses NEC's achievement in transmitting data over long distances and mentions submarine cables in the context of internet connectivity.

Seacom Ltd., the South African company that controls the cable, detected a fault on Saturday, Chief Digital Officer Prenesh Padayachee said in an interview with Bloomberg on Monday. He estimated the problem is in waters about 150 meters (492 feet) to 170 meters deep in an area where Iran-backed Houthi fighters have been targeting ships with drones and missiles.

The incident highlights how vulnerable critical subsea infrastructure can be, particularly in shallow waters with lots of cables. There are approximately 16 cable systems in the Red Sea, connecting Europe to Asia via Egypt.

While Seacom was able to quickly re-route internet traffic onto alternative cables, it now has to figure out the logistics of repairing a cable in a war zone, according to Padayachee.

“A pending cease-fire in the region may provide a good window for the repair,” Padayachee said.

Houthi militants have made threats to sabotage critical undersea cables on social media, but there’s no evidence to suggest they have been successful. The vast majority of cable damage is caused by fishing equipment such as trawler nets or anchors dragging on the sea floor, according to data from the International Cable Protection Committee.

Eight West African countries were suffering a second day of major connectivity issues on Friday with users in South Africa also affected, after damage to four sub-sea cables. The cause of the cable cutting was still not known, though a shifting of the seabed was among the likely possibilities.

“Repairs can take weeks to months, depending on where the damage is, what needs to be repaired, and local weather conditions,” said a spokesperson at internet analytics firm Cloudflare. “The assignment of repair ships depends on a number of factors, including ownership of the impacted cables.”

The West Africa Cable System, MainOne, South Atlantic 3 and ACE sea cables — arteries for telecommunications data — were all affected on Thursday and Friday.

MTN Group Ltd. – one of the largest wireless carriers in Africa – said that ACE and WACS have jointly initiated the repair process, and that they would send a vessel to fix the damaged cables.

Orange Marine said the firm was one of the specialist companies that would be involved in the repair operations for the cables, adding that other companies are also involved in efforts to restore the various cables. It said the repair time is not yet known.

Data show a major disruption to connectivity in eight West African countries, with Ivory Coast, Liberia and Benin being the most affected, NetBlocks, an internet watchdog, said in a post on X. Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon are among other countries impacted. Several companies have also reported service disruptions in South Africa.

Ghana’s main stock exchange extended trading hours by an hour on Thursday and Friday, while Nigeria’s second-largest cement maker scrapped a call with investors as the damage to four subsea cables off the west coast of Africa, stymied businesses across parts of the continent.

“This is a devastating blow to internet connectivity along the west coast of Africa, which will be operating in a degraded state for weeks to come,” said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis firm Kentik.

Ghana’s National Communications Authority said cable disruptions also occurred in Senegal and Portugal.

“This has led to a significant degradation of data services across the country, with mobile-network operators working around the clock to restore full services,” the authority said.

### Red Sea

The cable faults off Ivory Coast come less than a month after three telecommunications cables were severed in the Red Sea, highlighting the vulnerability of critical communications infrastructure. The anchor of a cargo ship sunk by Houthi militants was probably responsible, according to assessments by the US and cable industry group the Internet Cable Protection Committee.

The Red Sea is a critical telecommunications route, connecting Europe to Africa and Asia via Egypt.

Together, the problems with cables on either side of the continent create a capacity crunch, with customers of those cables scrambling to find alternative routes.

Microsoft Corp. reported disruptions to its cloud services and Microsoft 365 applications across Africa.

The Downdetector website showed that a number of companies in South Africa were still severely affected on Friday, including Microsoft and Nedbank Group Ltd.

Telkom SA SOC Ltd.’s Openserve fiber unit and Standard Bank Group Ltd. were also affected, they said in statement, with Openserve adding it had re-routed traffic.

Off the southeastern coast of South Africa, the island country of Mauritius also experienced outages, with Mauritius Telecom Ltd. having to arrange to redirect traffic to other cables, it said.

Last year, WACS, along with another pipe – the South Atlantic 3 – were damaged near the mouth of the Congo River following an undersea landslide. The loss of the cables knocked out international traffic traveling along the west coast of Africa and took about a month to repair.","The article discusses significant disruptions to internet services in Africa due to damage to multiple undersea cables.

"$1.5 Billion Investment to Reduce London-Tokyo Latency by 60ms","$1.5 billion investment in new submarine cables cutting latency by 60ms between London and Tokyo, enhancing connectivity and redundancy.","https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/122989-1-5-billion-the-cost-of-cutting-london-toyko-latency-by-60ms","2012-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","",Yes,"Sebastian Anthony","New York, New York, United States","7500","2012-03-20","English","ExtremeTech","Starting this summer, a convoy of ice breakers and specially-adapted polar ice-rated cable laying ships will begin to lay the first ever trans-Arctic Ocean submarine fiber optic cables. Two of these cables, called Arctic Fibre and Arctic Link, will cross the Northwest Passage which runs through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. A third cable, the Russian Optical Trans-Arctic Submarine Cable System (ROTACS), will skirt the north coast of Scandinavia and Russia. All three cables will connect the United Kingdom to Japan, with a smattering of branches that will provide high-speed internet access to a handful of Arctic Circle communities. The completed cables are estimated to cost between $600 million and $1.5 billion each.

All three cables are being laid for the same reasons: Redundancy and speed. As it stands, it takes roughly 230 milliseconds for a packet to go from London to Tokyo; the new cables will reduce this by 30% to 170ms. This speed-up will be gained by virtue of a much shorter run: Currently, packets from the UK to Japan either have to traverse Europe, the Middle East, and the Indian Ocean, or the Atlantic, US, and Pacific, both routes racking up around 15,000 miles in the process. It's only 10,000 miles (16,000km) across the Arctic Ocean, and you don't have to mess around with any land crossings, either.

The massive drop in latency is expected to supercharge algorithmic stock market trading, where a difference of a few milliseconds can gain (or lose) millions of dollars. It is for this reason that a new cable is currently being laid between the UK and US -- it will cost $300 million and shave ""just"" six milliseconds off the fastest link currently available. The lower latency will also be a boon to other technologies that hinge heavily on the internet, such as telemedicine (and teleconferencing) and education. Telephone calls and live news coverage would also enjoy the significantly lower latency. Each of the fiber optic cables will have a capacity in the terabits-per-second range, which will probably come in handy too.

Beyond the stock markets, though, the main advantage of the three new cables is added redundancy. Currently, almost every cable that lands in Asia goes through a choke point in the Middle East or the Luzon Strait between the Philippine and South China seas. If a ship were to drag an anchor across the wrong patch of seabed, billions of people could wake up to find themselves either completely disconnected from the internet or surfing with dial-up-like speeds. The three new cables will all come down from the north of Japan, through the relatively-empty Bering Sea -- and the Arctic Ocean, where each of the cables will run for more than 5,000 miles, is one of the least-trafficked parts of the world. That said, the cables will still have to be laid hundreds of meters below the surface to avoid the tails of roving icebergs.

Each cable will be laid by a pair of ships: an ice breaker that leads the way, and a cable ship. Until now it has been impossible to lay cables in the Arctic Ocean, but the retreat of the Arctic sea ice means that the Northwest Passage is now generally ice-free from August to October; a big enough window that cable can be laid fairly safely. Existing cable ships (and there aren't many of them) are all outfitted for balmier climes, so all three cables will require the use of a polar ice-rated ship that has been retrofitted to carry cable-laying gear.","The article discusses the laying of new submarine fiber optic cables across the Arctic Ocean, specifically mentioning Arctic Fibre, Arctic Link, and ROTACS.

"Impact of Submarine Cable Cuts on Egypt's Internet","Egypt lost 70% of its Internet connectivity due to the cutting of two submarine fiber-optic cables in the Mediterranean Sea.","https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/networking/how-the-internet-went-out-in-egypt","2011-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","Written by",Yes,-,"New York, NY, United States",-,"2011-01-28","English","ZDNet","**How the Internet Went Out in Egypt**

We think of the Internet as universal. We think of it in terms of a utility like electricity or water. It's none of those things. In some countries, like the U.S., it would be very hard to 'turn off' the Internet. In places like Egypt, though, with a limited number of Internet backbones and a handful of Domain Name Service (DNS) servers, it's easy. Here's how it appears the Egyptian government turned their country's Internet off.

First, here are some bare basics on how the Internet works. Every time you go to a Web site, you use its domain name such as Yahoo, ZDNet, etc. to find it. That's not what the Internet's software uses though to hook you up to a Web site. Instead, your network connection uses address resolver software to look up the site's IP address at a DNS server from the natural language address you've given it. DNS is the Internet master address list. With it, instead of writing out an Internet IPv4 address like ""http://209.85.135.99/,"" one of Google's many addresses, you can simply type in ""http://www.google.com"" and you'll be you on your way. But, DNS can only work if it has the right address information in it.

One of the things that Egypt has done to block out the Internet is remove access to its DNS servers. As Mark Hoffman of the Internet Storm Center explained, ""From an IT security perspective how do you shut down a country? From what I can see for us external to the country access to the DNS servers is removed.""

In short, you can't currently get the Internet IP addresses for most Egyptian Web sites. In Egypt, the reverse is true. They can't get to the right Internet addresses of the world's Web sites.

Egypt didn't stop with just locking down its DNS servers. The Egyptian government has also, according to BGPmon.net, ordered ISPs to stop routing all networks. Specifically, before the shutdown, there were 2903 Egyptian networks, originated from 52 ISPs. Today at 2am UTC, the numbers look quite different, there were only 327 Egyptian networks left on the Internet.

How was Egypt able to do this? It didn't take much. Egypt has only a handful of high-bandwidth Internet backbones entering the country. You may recall that in 2008 Egypt briefly lost 70% of its Internet connectivity when a mere two submarine fibre-optic cables in the Mediterranean Sea were cut by accident.

People who think that giving our government might want to consider how well it's worked out for Egypt. Yes, Egypt has prevented protesters from organizing over the Internet, but how would you feel if you could no longer talk to your friends or get news over the Internet? Even if you were politically indifferent wouldn't you be more worried, upset and angry than ever?","The article discusses the shutdown of the Internet in Egypt and specifically mentions that 'Egypt briefly lost 70% of its Internet connectivity when a mere two submarine fibre-optic cables in the Mediterranean Sea were cut.'

The Yemeni government has granted permits for the repair of two out of three cables, but refused the third because of a dispute with one of the cable’s consortium members.

Repairs to the Seacom and EIG cables have been approved, but the consortium that runs AAE-1, which includes telecommunications company TeleYemen, was not granted a permit by Yemen’s internationally recognized government, according to documents seen by Bloomberg.

Three out of more than a dozen cables that run through the Red Sea, a critical route for connecting Europe’s internet infrastructure to Asia’s, were knocked offline by the Houthi-sunk Rubymar vessel in late February. Although the telecommunications data that passes along the damaged cables was re-routed, the incident highlighted the vulnerability of critical subsea infrastructure and the challenges of making repairs in a conflict zone.

The dispute over the third cable derives from the split political control of TeleYemen, the country’s sole telecommunications provider, a reflection of the country’s broader geopolitical divisions. The company has two branches, one in Aden under control of the internationally recognized Yemeni government, and the other in Sanaa under the control of the Houthi militia group. The Yemeni government refused to cooperate with the Houthi-linked part of TeleYemen associated with the AAE-1 cable consortium and sought to appoint a representative from the Aden branch, according to the documents. But the consortium didn’t approve the alternative representative and Yemen’s government declined to grant a permit, according to the documents.

E-Marine, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi-based Emirates Telecommunications Group Co. PJSC, is contracted to carry out the repairs.

The Aden branch of TeleYemen, affiliated with the Yemeni government, wrote a letter to Yemen’s Telecommunications Ministry demanding that E-Marine provide a £10 million ($12.5 million) bank guarantee to ensure it would not carry out any repairs on the AAE-1 cable when the company was fixing the other two cables until the dispute was resolved. The ministry initially approved the condition, according to the documents, but Yemen’s cabinet decided it wasn’t necessary, a senior government official told Bloomberg.

It’s unclear if the Houthis, an Iran-backed militia group which controls much of Yemen’s Red Sea coastline, including the key port of Hodeida, will let E-Marine fix the two cables. The group, which has been attacking ships in the area with drones and missiles for months, has previously said only it can grant permission for the repairs.

The repair ships will take about a week to reach the cables and then approximately two days to fix each one, according to Seacom Ltd.’s Prenesh Padayachee. The cables will be lifted to the surface and fresh cable will be spliced in to replace the damaged sections.

The repair crew will also assess the Rubymar, the Houthi-sunk ship whose anchor most likely severed the cables in February. Seacom estimates that the ship is currently about 1 kilometer away from its cable, Padayachee said, and seems to be stable.

""But we don’t want to do a repair and then have this vessel falling into the new cables,"" he said. ""In all likelihood it will have to be moved.""

The three damaged cables carry about 25% of traffic in the region, according to estimates from Hong Kong-based internet provider HGC Global Communications, which uses the cables.","The article discusses the situation surrounding the repairs of submarine internet cables damaged in the Red Sea, detailing the implications of the damage on internet connectivity and the geopolitical challenges affecting the repair process.

It's easy to forget that, at the end of the day, the magical wireless world of broadband Internet comes down to one cable plugged into another.

You can imagine how important that cable becomes, then, when the world's use of said Internet is proliferating at a breakneck pace. And when you're talking about ocean-spanning infrastructure? Well, there's a price to match.

This summer, several icebreakers and cable-laying ships will install the first-ever trans-Arctic Ocean undersea fiberoptic cables, a trio of lines to speed up Internet connectivity between the United Kingdom and Japan. (With London and Tokyo in mind, specifically.)

How much faster, you ask? Sixty milliseconds.

For how much money? Between $600 million and $1.5 billion.

There's also redundancy to consider: when a continent's Internet is really just one cable plugged into another, it's critical that there are redundant cables in place so that an accidental break -- say, a ship's anchor catches on one -- doesn't send the global economy in a tailspin.

"Under the Sea: Rethinking Intercontinental Fiber Optic Cables in a Wireless Era","Examines the impact of severed undersea cables on East Africa's internet connectivity, highlighting vulnerabilities in global telecommunications.","https://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-02/under-sea-age-wireless-cant-we-do-better-intercontinental-fiber-optic-cables","2012-02-29T00:00:00.000Z","Clay Dillow",Yes,"Clay Dillow","New York, New York, United States","100000","2012-02-29","English","New World Sciences Corporation","On Saturday, a ship waiting to enter the Kenyan port city of Mombasa wandered into a restricted area and dropped its anchor, inadvertently severing a major undersea Internet and phone link to East Africa. This kind of thing happens from time to time, but Saturday’s incident represents a particular stroke of bad timing. The cable severed was already overworked, rerouting data from three other cables that were accidentally severed a week prior in the Red Sea. All said, these fiber-optic channels are the backbone of East Africa’s telecommunications infrastructure. Now one single undersea fiber-optic link is left to carry the entire load for all of East Africa, slowing internet connections in Rwanda, Kenya, Burundi, Ethiopia, Tanzania, and South Sudan by 20 percent until repairs are made, a process that could take weeks.

Before plugging into the high-capacity subsea fiber optic network three years ago, most Internet traffic in East Africa moved through expensive satellite connections or painfully slow telephone lines. Since then economies in the region have come to rely on their increased connectivity, so this weekend’s incident comes dangerously close to spelling a small economic disaster. It also raises a larger question: Why, when global economies and day-to-day life are so reliant on access to the Internet, are we still relying on these seemingly vulnerable undersea cables, these accident-prone physical “tubes” connecting continents across the oceans? Why, in a world that’s increasingly wireless, are we still so wired? Isn’t there a better way to connect the globe?

The answer is: Not really. Fiber optic communication, for all of its shortcomings, is actually pretty amazing, and it’s getting better by the year. Accidents do happen. In 2006 earthquakes in the Luzon Strait near Taiwan severed seven of nine cables and wrought havoc on communications networks for weeks, and twice in 2008 cables in the Mediterranean were damaged, disrupting communications in the Middle East, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent (and that’s just two recent examples–there are many, many more). But there’s really no technology that can touch our current fiber optics technology. The solution to problems like those East Africa is currently experiencing is not less fiber optic cable, but more.

“It’s amazing that we’re reliant on these physical links, but the reason we are is because of the kind of quantum leaps that fiber optic technology offers,” says Andrew Blum, author of the forthcoming book _Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet._ The physical cables running along (and sometimes under) the seabed carry huge volumes of data in the form of light, orders of magnitude more data than can be packed into radio signals that might be beamed wirelessly via satellites or antenna towers. The idea of replacing those cables with some kind of through-the-air technology is tempting, but for the foreseeable future we’re stuck with fiber optics.

Fiber optic cables carry orders of magnitude more data than can be beamed wirelessly “The problem is that the volumes of data we’re talking about require a very wide spectrum of frequencies,” Marvin Sirbu, professor of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, says. “And in order to get a wide spectrum of frequencies you need to get into very high-frequency electromagnetic waves. Light waves are very, very high-frequency. If you look at the frequencies we normally think of as radio waves, to find that much spectrum you’d have to be at frequencies so high that–like light–they fade in fog or in rain, and therefore can’t really be used to go to a satellite and back, or even over long distances on the ground.”

Instead, Sirbu says, we put those high-frequency signals into optical fiber in the form of light. The fiber is extremely transparent so the signal doesn’t fade over distance. There’s no fog or rain or other atmospheric moisture inside to interfere with the signal, so it maintains its integrity whether traveling across the room or across the Pacific. When you run out of capacity, you lay a new cable. Or, even better, you can dial up the capacity in the cables already laid.

This is where fiber optics creates those “quantum leaps” forward, says Blum. The standard operating unit for fiber optics right now is something like 10-gigabits per second. But new optical modules that are being swapped into common systems boost that capacity to 40 or even 100 gigabits per second. The same cables can then carry ten times more capacity, growing the system without laying a single new cable on the seafloor. Other tricks–involving everything from new ways of channeling signals to implementing lenses known as “time telescopes” to manipulate light pulses–could potentially keep that capacity growing at a rapid pace for the foreseeable future.

The key to averting disasters like the one East Africa is flirting with is redundancy, Sirbu says. “If you look at the U.S., we have cable landing sites at many different places, from Florida to Maine and all up and down the West Coast as well,” Sirbu says. “Given the interconnection of networks around the world, if fiber going into one landing location is broken there is fiber landing at other locations that will still be operational. But Africa is probably the continent least densely served by fiber optics, especially when compared to Europe, North America, or East Asia. They’re in a riskier position.”

That’s a problem for East Africa, particularly in a situation like this wherein two separate incidents have severed two of the three main fiber optic nerves feeding data into and out of the region. And while it seems that vulnerable undersea cables are the cause of the region’s current connectivity woes, the key to ensuring that East Africa doesn’t find its communications infrastructure hanging by a single fiber optic thread ever again–to ensure it doesn’t end up temporarily back in the days of dial-up and satellite signals–is route diversity. In other words, the answer is more fiber optics cables, not fewer.

“These cuts are always exciting because these are the moments that remind everyone that the cables are there,” Blum says. “This cut in particular is more exciting because it’s the first time you really get to see what it means for East Africa to have fiber when three years ago it didn’t. So I optimistically look at it upside down. Its only the incredible capacity of fiber optic technology that has allowed the Internet to progress across the world. You wouldn’t have this global Internet without fiber optics–that’s what’s so amazing about it.","The article discusses the severing of undersea cables, specifically detailing an incident that disrupted internet connectivity in East Africa.

With the threat of today's protests looming in Egypt, on Thursday Egyptian authorities cut the nation off the internet. No online communication could pass in or out of the country. We investigated whether a similar lockdown could happen in America.  
  
**How the Egyptian government erased its citizens from the internet**  
No one is completely certain what happened to the Egyptian internet, but it appears that the shutdown started off early in the week with the country blocking Twitter and Facebook access for those within its borders. Then, shortly after Thursday midnight local time, the country simply disappeared from the internet. With a few exceptions like the stock exchange, Egyptian websites and services were unreachable; the network traffic over Egyptian borders dropped by an astonishing 90 percent. Cell phone networks were also down.  
  
How did it happen? Most likely, according to experts, the Egyptian authorities made a few phone calls to the country's handful of large internet service providers. Their request would have been simple: Make it impossible for Egyptians to communicate with other countries and each other using the internet.  
  
But early Friday morning, thousands of routers in Egypt had their minds wiped. Suddenly they had no idea where anything was on the Egyptian internet. James Cowie of network analysis firm Renesys observed the Egyptian shutdown as it happened. Renesys observed the virtually simultaneous withdrawal of all routes to Egyptian networks in the Internet's global routing table. Approximately 3,500 individual BGP routes were withdrawn, leaving no valid paths by which the rest of the world could continue to exchange Internet traffic with Egypt's service providers.  
  
**Could the same thing happen in America?**  
Egypt's internet infrastructure is quite sophisticated, and it's one of the most highly networked countries in its immediate region. Despite these differences, it's very possible that Egypt's swift shutdown of its country's internet could provide a model for American governments of the future.  
  
Alex Stamos, a computer security expert, thinks the U.S. probably wouldn't take the country off the internet, but instead try to prevent Americans from reaching ""enemy"" countries or regions online.  
  
Both Ringel and Stamos agreed that another possibility would be to cut off physical access to the internet. There are only a limited number of cables leading out of the U.S. to other parts of the world. Physically cut them and you've got what network geeks call ""an air gap.""  
  
**But wouldn't it be illegal for the U.S. government to shut down the internet?**  
All the scenarios for shutting down the American internet involve some degree of collusion between the government and private companies who provide internet access to millions of people in the U.S.  
  
Such a bill would allow the President to order shutdown of the American internet without any checks from the Judiciary. This is something that worries digital liberties groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  
  
If the U.S. government actually severs cables in order to cut off internet access in the U.S., then they have lost all regard for the rule of law and all bets are off.","The article discusses the implications of physically cutting cables that connect the U.S. to the global internet, mentioning that doing so would create an 'air gap' and prevent network traffic.

Internet service providers serving Africa have been forced to send their traffic via elaborate detours following damage to four major subsea cables off the continent’s west coast last week.

Some telecommunications companies are bypassing the cables by going via Brazil, according to one of the cable operators. Others have shifted their traffic overland onto a web of cross-border terrestrial cables.

It’s a patchwork job that’s dramatically improved connection issues for millions of customers after the West Africa Cable System, MainOne, South Atlantic 3 and ACE sea cables went down last week. But the re-routing, sometimes via lower-capacity cables, has left many countries with slower internet speeds.

“The only way to get the African network back to the normal status quo is to repair those four severed cables,” said Roderick Beck, a consultant who sources network capacity for telecommunications clients. “Those cables provide most of the direct connectivity to most West African countries.”

The cause of the faults hasn’t been determined, but a preliminary analysis from MainOne suggested seismic activity on the seabed that may have led to an undersea landslide. The company estimated that it would take between three and five weeks to restore connectivity.

Widespread outages hit at least eight West African countries, including Nigeria, the continent’s largest economy, and were felt as far away as South Africa, which relies on the cables for international data transfer. Ivory Coast, Liberia and Benin were the most affected, impacting everything from international phone calls to local money transfers and e-commerce.

By Tuesday, connectivity levels had been mostly restored, but “service quality remains diminished in some of the affected countries,” NetBlocks said.

Many companies shifted their traffic to the high-capacity Equiano cable, which also runs along the coast, but is only directly connected to Togo, South Africa and Nigeria. Others have turned to Angola Cables, whose SACS cable runs from Angola to Brazil and from there the company can send data to the US and Europe.

### Internet Slowdown

Ghana’s National Communications Authority said in a statement that it was allocating the “limited bandwidth currently available” to key businesses, including public utilities and banks.

“Communicating through emails has been a challenge, the completion of a number of deals has been delayed and it’s been difficult to make payments to clients making withdrawals to meet emergencies,” Nana Kofi Agyeman Gyamfi, head of wealth management at Bora Capital Advisors Ltd. in Accra, said.

Nigeria’s National Communications Commission said in a statement on Monday that data and voice services had been restored to “approximately 90% of their peak utilization capacities.”

Ivory Coast’s Digital Economy Minister Ibrahim Kalil Konate said that although internet services were “functional,” capacity would not be fully restored until the cables were repaired, which he said he hoped would be completed by early April.

### Repair Plans

Cable repair company Global Marine’s CS Sovereign vessel, currently in port in Portland, England, and Orange Marine’s Leon Thevenin, currently docked in Cape Town, South Africa, will be loaded up with fiber optic cable before heading to waters off the Ivory Coast to investigate and repair the undersea cable problems. Telkom, one of South Africa’s biggest internet providers, expects the repairs to take about three weeks, depending on weather conditions. A spokesperson for Orange Marine confirmed that it would assist in the repair operation, but declined to comment further.

The article emphasizes the urgent need for repairs to restore normal internet service, which has been affected across multiple West African countries.

This strong focus on the implications of the cut sea cables and their central role in telecommunications data transfer clearly satisfies the criterion for being an article on the topic of cut sea cables."

A ship leaving the United Arab Emirates uses weights attached to buoys to help sink an underwater Internet cable.

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Did you ever wonder how people in Japan connect to websites hosted in San Francisco? Or how a New Yorker can Skype with a friend in Sydney?

It sounds crazy, but Earth's continents are physically linked to one another through a vast network of subsea, fiber-optic cables that circumnavigate the globe. Cords no thicker than your home's broadband connection stretch along the bottom of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans; through the Suez canal; across the Mediterranean Sea and around the coasts of Africa and South America.

Indian telecom giant Tata, one of the world's largest subsea cable providers, manages 130,500 miles of fiber sitting at the bottom of the ocean floor. That's enough to circle the planet five times. It takes a ship six weeks just to load the cable for a cross-ocean voyage.

Why is all that underwater cable necessary? It's a matter of speed, and laying in enough safeguards to ensure that the Internet won't suddenly go down.

Subsea fiber-optic cables can tie two giant centers of commerce together, reducing data traffic delays. Three companies are in the process of building cable networks that link London directly to Tokyo -- through the polar ice cap -- with cables capable of 10 gigabit-per-second speeds. (That's 2,000 times faster than your home Internet connection).

Those cables could reduce the Internet's latency by about 60 milliseconds between those two points.

That's an imperceptible lag for the average Internet user, but it's an eternity for high-speed stock traders. They can make or lose millions of dollars in that span of time.

It's not just financial institutions, which make up a very small portion of total Internet usage, that are interested in faster speeds. Internet service providers like Comcast and Time Warner Cable like to go zoom as well, because it gives them capacity to meet the growing demands on their networks.

Subsea cables have the added benefit of being shielded from wind, trees, storms and other destructive forces. They don't require massive towers to carry them, like over-the-land cables do.

They're literally just laid on the bottom of the sea, and once placed there, they can more or less be left untouched for a quarter century.

But sometimes cables get cut, particularly in shallow water. They get accidentally clipped by ship anchors about twice a year.

It happened most recently a month ago, when a ship dropped anchor off the coast of Kenya and cut Internet service for much of the country. Google noticed a steep drop in availability of its services in Kenya on Feb. 25.

That's why cables are outfitted with GPS, so ships can find and patch them when they break. There are outsourced companies on the clock 24/7 to do repairs at a moment's notice.

Having multiple cables connecting continents from many different locations means the Internet is less likely to be massively disrupted when a cable is snapped.

That's why Tata says it was critical to build the final leg in the world's first round-the-planet network, which it completed last week. The final cable connects Mumbai to Marseille, France. Tata's other links tie the United Kingdom to New Jersey, Spain to Africa and Japan to Australia.

Together, those pipes handle 25% of the world's Internet traffic. Tata wouldn't put a price tag on the project, but an under-construction arctic cable linking Asia, North America and Europe has an estimated cost of $1.5 billion.

The upshot of all that investment is that if one cable snaps, you'll still be able to play ""Words with Friends"" with a partner 10,000 miles away.

*The Internet was originally invented to be a communication network that could survive a nuclear war. Ironically, the monster that grew from that idea known as the World Wide Web is actually very, very fragile. They didn't anticipate what the Internet would become--because they weren't insane--and as a result, the whole operation now sits on a rather shaky foundation.*  

**1. The Internet is a Series of Cables, and Cables Can be Cut**  
Considering how much people freak out when a single big site goes down, it's clear that most of us think of the Internet as invincible. But the truth is, the Internet travels from continent to continent by way of a network of trans-oceanic cables, each thousands of miles long. If enough of these cables were compromised, international Internet communication could collapse entirely.  

These cables are not protected and are vulnerable to damage. The SEA-ME-WE-3 cable was severed by a 7.1 magnitude earthquake and a boat anchor, cutting communications capacity significantly and leaving millions without reliable Internet access.  

*Nothing can be done to protect all the cables, but they can be repaired quickly.*  

**2. Hordes of Zombie Robots Will Kill Us All**  
The Storm Botnet, controlled by Leo Kuvayev, could potentially muscle entire countries off of the Internet due to its vast network of hijacked computers. The botnet has been responsible for a significant portion of spam and could disrupt world communication and trade.  

*Knowledge and caution among Internet users is the best defense against such threats.*  

**3. Someone Impersonates the Ferryman**  
Imagine the Internet as a river with DNS servers acting as ferrymen. In 2007, a vulnerability was discovered in Microsoft DNS servers that could allow them to be hijacked. The rapid growth of the Internet has led to more DNS servers, increasing the risk of attacks.  

*The security of the Internet is a constant battle against evolving threats.*","The article discusses the fragility of the Internet infrastructure, specifically mentioning 'trans-oceanic cables' and their vulnerability.

It cites incidents where undersea cables were damaged, such as the SEA-ME-WE-3 cable severed by an earthquake and a boat anchor, leading to significant internet outages.

This aligns with the criterion of discussing cut sea cables as a central theme."
"What If?","$10M daily economic loss due to a three-week internet outage from a severed undersea cable off Somalia in July 2017.","https://www.leadersedge.com/p-c/what-if","2017-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","Kenneth Howe",Yes,"Kenneth Howe","Washington, D.C., United States","4250","2017-10-02","English","The Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers","### The internet has gone down. How long can your business withstand the interruption? One day? Two days? One week? What if the outage were widespread? How long would it take for the financial impact to be ruinous?

The answer is not long at all. The internet is as essential to commerce today as are people. Without a connection, employees might as well stay home and watch Netflix. Oops, can’t do that either.

“If the internet tips over for just 24 hours, it would cause a global economic crisis because all transactions would grind to a halt,” says Stephen Catlin, executive deputy chairman of XL Group. “If the internet tips over for seven days, it would be cataclysmic.”

He’s right for an important reason: there is no insurance policy whatsoever that absorbs the risk of the world wide web grinding to a sudden halt. A company might have a policy covering the business interruption caused by a loss of access to its ISP (internet service provider) or cloud providers. But insurance covering the cessation of the internet itself is just too big a risk for the industry to bear.

“It would be like asking us to find insurance just in case there was no electricity in the world,” says Robert Parisi, managing director and cyber product leader at Marsh. “That’s a cool movie, but no carrier will cover you for that.”

The reason is that insurance policies absorbing business interruption losses typically contain an exclusion for the general failure of “utilities,” which in this case would be the internet. “If the internet goes kaput, there would be big problems for affected companies and the global economy, but it wouldn’t have an impact on the insurance marketplace,” Parisi says.

### Could It Shut Down?

Although the internet has never experienced a complete breakdown, parts of it have shut down in the past. In October 2016, for instance, hackers launched a successful distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) against Dyn, a managed DNS (domain name system) provider of internet services to Twitter, Reddit, CNN, Spotify and thousands of other websites, shutting them down. DNS providers translate website names into IP (internet protocol) addresses.

“Approximately 500 companies that relied exclusively on Dyn for their web services suffered extensive downtimes and lost sales,” says Stephen Boyer, co-founder and chief technology officer of BitSight, an internet security firm. “This represented about 8% of Dyn’s customer base. Other companies relied on a variety of DNS providers, making the impact less severe.”

A more recent internet outage occurred for customers of Amazon Web Services (AWS), a provider of on-demand cloud computing platforms to companies such as Airbnb, Time and Netflix. The outage affected countless websites and web services on the U.S. East Coast for several hours in February. The culprit was human error, Amazon later reported.

The financial impact of the Dyn and AWS outages has yet to be tallied. But other internet interruptions provide some sense of the financial cost. In July 2017, a severed undersea cable off the coast of Somalia resulted in a three-week-plus internet outage in the country, costing its economy an estimated $10 million a day. When the prior government of Egypt pulled the plug on the internet for five days in 2011 to restrict communications among anti-government activists, its economy suffered losses estimated at $18 million per day.

Altogether, there were 81 separate instances of sporadic internet outages in 19 countries across the world in 2016. The collective cost of these interruptions was $2.8 billion in global GDP, according to a study by the Brookings Institution’s Center for Technology Innovation.

The center has also projected the cost of an outage across the entire United States: “A national internet outage for one week…would reduce economic activity by at least $54.1 billion. And if that outage lasted an entire year, the economic costs would be at least $2.8 trillion.”

It would be like asking us to find insurance just in case there was no electricity in the world. That’s a cool movie, but no carrier will cover you for that.

Robert Parisi, managing director and cyber product leader, Marsh

These costs would be uninsured—not that companies wouldn’t file claims anyway. “The likelihood is that insurers would deny them, resulting in protracted litigation,” Parisi says. “A lot of subrogation would occur, with one party blaming another party, and so on.”

Could the entire web grind to a halt on a national or global basis? It’s possible. In 2002, an attack occurred against all 13 of the internet’s root name servers—the crucial components that map domain names to IP addresses.

“The attack lasted for an hour,” recalls Jody Westby, CEO of Global Cyber Risk, a provider of cyber-risk advisory services. “The hackers used a botnet to send a flood of messages to each of the servers, which were protected by packet filters. This helped to limit the damage, causing little impact on users.”

The import of the attack is distressing. “The internet was designed with resiliency and not security in mind, meaning if one part went down there would be other parts still left standing,” Westby says. “The fact that all 13 root name servers were attacked was a wake-up call, resulting in replicating the root name servers at a dozen other locations globally. Despite this failsafe, two of the 13 root name servers were attacked in 2007, shutting each of them down for about 24 hours.”

Still, the replication of the root name servers after the 2002 attack enabled the requests to be sent to the “mirror imaged” root name servers and thus minimized the impact of the attack.

### The Problem Is Risk Aggregation

The internet’s importance to the smooth functioning of global economies is obvious. Without a connection, businesses would be in a lurch. While insurers and reinsurers consider cyber insurance to be the industry’s most promising market, they are stymied in offering broader coverages.

“It’s just not possible to have a level of confidence in the potential risks,” says Mark Synnott, senior broker and global cyber practice leader at Willis Re. “Right now, it is difficult to test how bad the insured loss could be.”

The problem is risk aggregation. Insurers and reinsurers are unable to gauge with a fair degree of certainty the aggregation of cyber-related business interruption exposures they may be absorbing across multiple lines of coverage, including property, casualty, marine, aviation and transport.

“A well-coordinated attack could result in the simultaneous occurrence of many different types of cyber losses,” says Robert Hartwig, associate professor and co-director of the Risk and Uncertainty Management Center at the University of South Carolina’s Darla Moore School of Business. “Right now, it is difficult to identify, assess and quantify what types of cyber losses might occur in association with other types of cyber losses.”

Minus this ability, the total losses could be unbearable. “It’s not like a natural disaster, where you can offset the risk of an earthquake in Japan with Florida windstorm exposures and Chilean earthquake risks,” Synnott says.

Catlin shares this perspective. “Every other catastrophic risk—terrorism, wind, earthquake and even a pandemic—are all regional or local risks,” he says. “The collapse of the internet is the only event I can think of where the whole globe would be affected in a nanosecond.”

### Breaking Down the Risk

Serious efforts are under way to paint a clearer picture of cyber risks. Traditional property catastrophe modeling firms like RMS and AIR Worldwide and newer cyber-risk rating vendors like BitSight and Cyence are partnering to develop robust cyber-risk models for underwriting purposes.

“We’re trying to break down cyber risk into its constituent parts to identify the key drivers of systemic risk to the insurance industry and then quantify these risks,” says Tom Harvey, senior product manager at RMS. “For instance, we’re looking closely at the various components that make up the backbone of the internet. We’re identifying the different pinch points, whether or not they could realistically suffer a disruption, and what the financial impact would be if it occurred.”

It’s just not possible to have a level of confidence in the potential risks. Right now, it is difficult to test how bad the insured loss could be.

Mark Synnott, senior broker and global cyber practice leader, Willis Re

Still, both Harvey and Boyer affirm that modeling cyber risks is a steep uphill climb. “The biggest wrinkle is the adversary, which, unlike the weather, deliberately adapts and changes to get around current defenses,” Boyer says. “There’s always something new that can come up, whereas it’s very unlikely we will have a new kind of windstorm or earthquake. It’s these new vulnerabilities that give pause.”

But he is optimistic that a solution is forthcoming. “We’re just starting to get quantifiable data on the usage of web services through internet telemetry and other means, learning who really is relying on Dyn and AWS and other parties and providers in different regions,” he says. “The next piece is determining the key interdependencies if one or the other is knocked offline.”

### The Cyber Insurance Market

As these efforts continue, the industry is confident that cyber-risk insurance will become a major contributor to premium volume in the future. In 2016, U.S. property-casualty insurers wrote $1.3 billion in direct written premiums for cyber insurance, a 35% increase from the prior year, according to A.M. Best.

A study by Allied Market Research tallies total gross premiums globally for cyber insurance at $3 billion today, estimating this figure will skyrocket to $14 billion by 2022. Most of the cyber-risk policies sold over this period will be underwritten differently. Unlike many other types of insurance, there is no standard ISO form for cyber insurance. “No two cyber policies are different.”}}} ]}},{","The article discusses the implications of internet outages and specifically mentions a severed undersea cable off the coast of Somalia that caused significant economic impact.

On Friday 19 July, 2024, the world woke up to what many have called the worst digital crisis of all time. A botched software update from cybersecurity giant CrowdStrike crashed some 8.5 million computers, smearing Microsoft's dreaded ""blue screen of death"" across the globe. Airlines cancelled over 46,000 flights in a single day. Hospitals called off surgeries. 911 emergency services faced disruptions in the US. Film Forum, an arthouse cinema in New York, switched to cash payments as its credit card system went down. Microsoft and CrowdStrike issued a solution, but the outages continue almost a week later. It's a reminder, frustrated IT experts said, to never push updates out on a Friday.  
As our infrastructure becomes ever more tangled with the internet, this won't be the last catastrophic online outage. But CrowdStrike wasn't the first, either. The history of computing is littered with examples of our digital fragility, and crashes of the past offer a glimpse of what it will feel like on the day the internet turns off.  
""There's a price to pay for the convenience we enjoy,"" says Ritesh Kotak, a cybersecurity and technology analyst. ""It will happen again, and from a technical standpoint, the fix for CrowdStrike was relatively easy. Next time, we might not be so lucky.""  
One of the earliest major outages came in 1997 thanks to a glitch at the company Network Solutions Inc., one of the main registrars that issues domain names for websites. A misconfigured database crashed every single website ending in .com or .net. It took down around one million sites, which at that point in history was a huge portion of the web. Some people didn't get their email. An untold number of web searches ended in frustration. Some businesses who couldn't reach clients and customers lost business around the 1997 crash, but overall, the problems were minimal.  
Yet with the internet now touching nearly every part of our daily lives, anything close to the Network Solutions outage has far greater consequences. Twenty-one years later, for example, a malware attack on the Alaskan community of Matanuska-Susitna took an array of digital services offline. The internet blackout sent 100,000 people back in time.  
""The cyber-attack, God help us, just about stopped everything, you know,"" local Helen Munoz told the BBC in 2019. ""In fact, the borough still hasn't sorted out their computers.""  
Employees were locked out of their workstations. Local libraries were ordered to turn off all their devices. In one government office, workers had to switch to typewriters to do their jobs. It was 10 weeks before the majority of the Matanuska-Susitna's systems came back online.  
Sometimes the problems start in the physical world. For a while, the entire nation of Armenia's internet connectivity depended on a single fibre-optic cable running through Georgia. If that sounds precarious, you're right. In 2011, a 75-year-old woman took all 2.9 million Armenians offline when she sliced through that cable with a spade near the Georgian village of Ksani. The woman, who was scavenging for copper at the time, was arrested but reportedly let go soon after because of her advanced age. She later told reporters: ""I have no idea what the internet is.""  
Forget human error: engineers have to take measures to protect undersea cables from shark attacks. Others felt its absence more keenly. ""You can feel it when you don't have access to the internet. You start going crazy,"" says Vahan Hovsepyan, senior community and public policy advisor at RIPE NCC, who lives in Armenia. ""There's no way to ensure stability when you have a cable that's thousands of kilometres long,"" Hovsepyan says, which highlights the importance of building redundancies into digital infrastructure.  
It's proof positive that, on some level, the internet really is just a series of tubes. Pensioners aren't the only threat to those tubes, either. In 2017, all of Zimbabwe lost its internet access for half a day. Local newspapers reported that a tractor had torn through a cable in South Africa.  
The fibre-optic cables in our backyards need protection from human beings, but the thousands of kilometres worth of cables draped across the ocean floor face their own dangers. Sharks have a mysterious fondness for biting undersea cables, which has caused outages in the past. There's a long history of teeth marks on these ocean cables, not just from sharks but other fish and barracudas. A tooth can penetrate the insulation and mix sea water to ground the power conductors. It's been causing problems for phone and telegraph cables since at least 1964. Today, Google reportedly wraps its underwater cables in a Kevlar-like material, in part to stop sharks and other ocean dwellers from biting through the internet.  
A quarter of Canada's internet and phone service was knocked out in 2022 because of a failure at Rogers Communications, one of the country's biggest telecom providers. It gave 11 million people a preview of last week's CrowdStrike debacle. Emergency services couldn't accept phone calls, hospitals cancelled appointments and businesses across the country couldn't accept debit card transactions. Canadian R&B star the Weeknd was forced to postpone a concert.  
Kotak, who lives in Toronto, says the Rogers outage didn't have a major impact on his life, but others weren't so lucky. ""A friend of mine literally missed the bar exam,"" he says. ""Her whole family were Rogers customers, and she couldn't get the exact address and room number for the test because she only had it written down in her email.""  
Legislators can prevent these kinds of problems by mandating safety measures in the technology and telecom industries, Kotak says. But sometimes, governments are responsible for internet shutdowns in the first place.  
Disabling the internet is also a go-to method for government censorship, both for authoritarian governments and stable democracies. ""It's a pretty massive problem,"" says Zach Rosson, a data analyst at Access Now, a digital rights advocacy group. ""By our definition, there have been over 1,500 internet shutdowns since 2016"", by governments, militaries and police forces.  
In fact, the CrowdStrike disaster shadowed an example that began the same day. For the last week, Bangladesh has faced near total internet blackout after a government shutdown in response to violent clashes between protesting students and police. The online cutoff has been accompanied by a curfew and reporters say the lack of internet access makes accurate information harder to come by. At least 150 people have been killed in the clashes, with some local media putting the figure much higher.  
There's a growing push to understand internet access as a human right. ""Think about all the things it gives you access to: employment, healthcare, education, communication, business and just understanding the world around you. We've found that internet shutdowns actually impede humanitarian delivery and prevent the documentation of atrocities,"" Rosson says.  
India is probably the world leader in using internet shutdowns to quell unrest, but it's a widespread tactic that's been deployed in at least 83 countries including Iran, Russia, Algeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Cameroon and Venezuela. In places where the internet connection depends on one fibre-optic cable, it makes for a glaring Achilles heel. After decades of the internet worming its way into every corner of our lives through wires and WiFi connections, you might think there would be more built-in fail-safes to keep the world churning. But largely the opposite is true.","The article discusses undersea cables, including direct mentions and contextual implications of incidents where these cables were cut, such as the case in Armenia and threats from sharks.

**Old laws for new risks at sea: mineral resources, climate change, sea lanes, and cables**  
Uwe K. Jenisch  
Received: 2 June 2011 / Accepted: 6 January 2012 / Published online: 31 January 2012  

**Abstract**: Maritime security in a broad sense means more than piracy and terrorism. This paper concentrates on the risk potential of current and future resource-related activities on the seabed. The seabed mining of hard mineral resources—in addition to hydrocarbons—leads to new controversial maritime boundary claims of states in their effort to expand national access rights to raw materials. Outer continental shelf claims in the Arctic Ocean are today's test bench for law of the sea conflicts. Fiber-optic cables running through regional seas, straits, and land bridges may become another risky issue, while the pattern of maritime transport routes is moving from Northern to Southern waters. Under a medium-term perspective, the sea level rise will endanger ports and coasts. Borderlines of maritime zones will move and thus generate more injustice and conflicts among states. The tools to solve borderline conflicts and options for dispute settlement are available in UNCLOS. Some other legal gaps are covered by the 2005 SUA Convention and by bilateral agreements, while resolutions by the UN Security Council begin to broaden rights of intervention and interdiction. The need for new laws remains.

**Keywords**: Seabed resources and excessive claims. Natural disasters and climate change. Sea lanes and cables. UNCLOS. SUA Convention 2005. UN Security Council as a legislator.

**1 Introduction**: Over the past years, we have witnessed that maritime violence, terrorism, and piracy are continuing to spread while the international legal system of interference rights and countermeasures remains full of gaps in addressing these issues. In other words, the inadequacies of the legal system are part of the problem of security at sea.

**2 Risks over marine mineral resources**: The world economy, still suffering from the financial crisis, is currently experiencing increasing commodity prices. Industrial associations and governments are monitoring patterns of supply and demand, not only for standard minerals like iron, but also for high-value metals (e.g., nickel, copper, titanium, gold) and rare earth elements (REE) like yttrium, indium, gallium, neodymium, and germanium.

**2.1 Minerals and the law of the sea**: Minerals from the seabed cannot replace terrestrial mining. Instead, they can complement the supply and make industry more independent of critical suppliers to the extent that costs and technology allow it to do so. The break-even point is near, while the legal–political conditions are favorable. 

The content continues to discuss various types of marine mineral deposits, legal frameworks under UNCLOS, and the implications for maritime security and international law.","The article discusses 'Fiber-optic cables' in the context of maritime security, indicating that they may become a risky issue.

It highlights the implications of seabed resource exploitation and mentions the importance of communication security related to sea lanes and cables.

A world without Candy Crush or indeed, even Facebook; a land without the Internet.

The thought may sound like heaven to minimalists, but in recent months, dictators around the world have been all too willing to transform the idea into a hellacious reality, flipping a switch and completely disconnecting whole nations from the Web: Syria. Egypt. Libya. All have been plunged into darkness during periods of civil unrest.

But is there any way the United States could be disconnected from the Internet? Could an act of terror, war, or simple governmental dictatorship snatch away our social feeds and online gaming? Curious, I reached out to several experts to examine all the potential doomsday scenarios.

### Physical attack on the tubes

They say the Internet is a series of tubes. One obvious way to disconnect the United States from the rest of the Net would be to cut, blow up, or otherwise destroy those tubes, right?

Not so fast. As it turns out, you’d need to cut a lot of tubes to completely disconnect the U.S. from the Internet. Check out the map below of all the undersea cables that connect the country to the outside world. Now, consider that TeleGeography’s map lists only undersea cables, and doesn’t include the legion of wires that connect the U.S. to Canada and Mexico over land. And what about wireless networks?

That’s a lot of cables! (Click to enlarge.)

Yeah, you’re starting to get the picture. Disconnecting all of America’s tubes just isn’t going to happen.

“It’s close enough to impossible that in realistic terms, it’s unlikely to the point of irrelevancy,” says Patrick Gilmore, the chief network architect at Akamai, a content delivery network estimated to be responsible for up to 20 percent of all Web traffic. The good news doesn’t end there.

“Even if you could do that, a lot of the reason things were done like that in Egypt and Syria were to keep people from posting to social networking sites,” Gilmore continues. “Many of those social networking sites are hosted here in the United States. So if you could wave a magic wand and disconnect the United States, people would still see all those posts from each other inside the United States. It wouldn’t stop that from happening.”

### Hack attack on the servers

If the tubes are the veins of the Internet, the servers that power the Net are its brains. Could hackers use their botnets and evil geek powers to send America spiraling offline?

“That’s actually much more likely than a physical attack, I think,” says Dorian Kim, VP of IP engineering and network development for NTT Communications, the second-largest Internet backbone provider in the world. “...The entire wiring system relies a great deal on various systems of trust. It’s possible for somebody—especially someone who is kind of an insider at an ISP or telco—to do things that would disrupt the infrastructure in a pretty widespread way.”

There are several caveats to that, however. Any hack attack of that magnitude would very likely extend beyond U.S. shores, for one thing. It would be very difficult and take a high level of technical ability to accomplish. And it wouldn’t last very long, either: Given the decentralized nature of the Net, Kim says the disruption would likely be limited to hours, or a day or two maximum.

Even if hackers managed to wreak havoc on the U.S. Internet, all the experts I spoke to expressed extreme doubt that an attack would be able to take out the entire country.

“Let’s take the CloudFlare attack,” says Gilmore, referring to a DDoS attack in Europe a few months ago that CloudFlare mitigated. “I was quoted in The New York Times as saying it was the largest publicly disclosed attack in the history of the Internet. That was 300 gigabits, or 300 billions. The total traffic on the Internet is measured in many, many terabits—trillions. And the U.S. is a large portion of that. A 500-gigabit attack—which again, would be the largest attack ever—would not be able to disrupt even a large portion of the United States.

“Some networks would go down,” he continues. “You might be able to take out an ISP in a city, and have that ISP go offline, but to take 25 or 50 percent of the U.S. offline? It’s not impossible to do, but it’d just be so ridiculously difficult.”

Individual things—specific ISPs, websites, and so on—would be much easier to attack, says Gilmore. Kim agrees: The Internet’s backbone carriers are just too strong to hack with any sort of effectiveness.

### The Man holding you down

So, widespread tube cutting and hack attacks would not only be incredibly difficult to pull off, but they would also be of questionable effectiveness. Now, let’s explore the darkest of these dark options. The Middle Eastern countries mentioned above disappeared from the Net thanks to the heavy hands of iron-fisted dictators. Is there any way the U.S. government could possibly do the same? Does the Man have an Internet kill switch?

“No, there’s no legal authority for it,” says Dan Auerbach, a staff technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “Even if some were invented through creative lawyering, the practical reality is that it would just be too difficult to do in any sort of short time frame.”

This circles back to the United States’ dense web of tubes, and all three experts I spoke to touched on this point. Small countries like Syria have very few Internet access points, and very few service providers maintaining those access points, making it trivial for the government in such nations to shut down the hardware. That ain’t so in this country.

“In the U.S., by contrast, we don’t have that sort of monolithic ISP space,” says Auerbach. “We have many different networks, and within those networks, there are many types of subnetworks operating. The amount of machinery you would need to shut down is enormous and controlled by lots of people. It’d be really hard to do that in any sort of quick way.”

And again, the headaches double when you add wide area and cellular networks to the mix. Safe to say, in the States, The Man isn’t going to shut us all down.

### Built to last?

So, rule out the tubes, the hackers, and The Man. What might be the most effective way to wreak havoc on the country’s infrastructure? NTT’s Dorian Kim has an idea.

“Most of the networks—whether you’re talking about networks like NTT, Level 3, AT&T, or content distribution people like Netflix or Akamai—all their traffic tends to get exchanged in a very small number of ‘carrier hotels’ in cities around the country,” Kim says.

“The number of those concentration points of activity that you’d need to knock out to do serious damage to the Internet is actually smaller than the number of submarine cables,” he continues. “If you … take out, oh, half a dozen of these around the country, you’d actually do serious damage to the infrastructure. And if you double that and take out the dozen biggest carrier hotels, the impact will be very severe.”

And therein lies the Internet’s biggest weakness. The great big Web’s decentralized nature makes it incredibly resistant to attack, but when you get down to brass tacks, all the mininetworks that make the whole have to hook up somewhere.

But don’t let that fool you: Pulling off an attack of that nature would be very difficult indeed, and its impact would be felt far and wide, not just in the United States. If—if—a large, well-informed, well-trained, and well-equipped team were able to pull off such a feat, it would be a direct attack against the entire world.

Let’s pull it back a bit. Thanks to its central role on the Net and its decentralized network infrastructure, the odds of the U.S. pulling a Syria and disappearing from the face of the Web are effectively nil. In fact, when Renesys—a leading network research firm—examined how difficult it would be for countries all around the world to be disconnected from the Net, the U.S. was ranked “Resistant.” Not Average. Not even Low Risk. Resistant. 

So breathe easy, folks. For all intents and purposes, if you’re in the States, you’ve got mail—and nothing is ever going to take away the Internet in a flash. Unless, of course, you forget to pay your bill.","The article 'America Offline: Can the U.S. be disconnected from the Net?' directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables by discussing undersea cables and their critical role in maintaining Internet connectivity.

- Like any system, biological or man-made, the Web has the potential to fail.  
- A major solar event could theoretically melt down the whole Internet in moments.  
- Future cyberwarfare will target not only military and industrial targets but Internet connectivity.  
- Almost all global Web traffic is dependent on deep-sea networks of fiber-optic cables.  

CNN —  
The Internet was designed to be robust, fault-tolerant and distributed, but its technology is still in its infancy.  

1. **Space weather**  
Solar flares are serious threats to communication systems. A major solar event could theoretically melt down the whole Internet.  

2. **Cyberwarfare**  
Future wars will increasingly target Internet connectivity, as seen with the Stuxnet worm that wreaked havoc in Iranian systems.  

3. **Political mandate**  
Governments can shut down the Internet during crises, as seen in Iran and Egypt.  

4. **Cable cutting**  
More than 99% of global Web traffic relies on undersea cables. In 2008, key cables were cut, disrupting communication between India and Egypt, with multiple cables reportedly affected.  

The article emphasizes the vulnerabilities of the Internet, particularly the dependence on undersea cables, making cable cutting a significant threat.","The article discusses cut sea cables as a significant threat to Internet connectivity.

The internet is a massive network of networks. It connects millions of computers together globally. Any computer in the network can communicate with another in the network. Data transferred over the internet is sent in a variety of languages, called protocols.

### **Could the Internet Go Down?**

The answer is no. But parts of it have. In 1988, **the Morris Worm shut down 10 percent of the internet**. 

### **Today’s Threats**

1. **Space Weather**: A solar flare can cause geomagnetic storms on Earth. If a storm of that magnitude occurred today, it could blow out transformers and melt down computer systems.
2. **Cable Cutting**: The internet is made up of undersea cables that are vulnerable. If enough cables were cut in a coordinated effort, **the entire internet could be taken down**.
3. **Cyberwarfare**: Cyberattacks are capable of disrupting websites and networks, and could potentially take down the entire internet.

### **What Would Happen If the Internet Went Down?**

**Author:** Sydney Brooke Pleasic

**Abstract**  
Submarine data cables are highly regarded as the core critical infrastructure of the digital age, with over 99% of all global communications traveling through these fiber optic lines under the sea floor. These cables form the physical infrastructure that supports one of the most vital communication networks of our modern world. They are relied on by military operations, the scientific community, everyday citizens when accessing the global internet, and the finance industry with these subsea cables being responsible for carrying out roughly $10 trillion worth of financial transactions a day.  

Given the importance of subsea cables to a functioning society and everyday life, which is only exacerbated in times of crisis, it may come as a surprise that the subsea network is often overlooked. The significance of this critical infrastructure is not entirely lost on the United States, EU, and other nations abroad. However, little action has been taken to secure the cables from current threats that both the United States and other international nations face regarding this crucial network, including threats from natural hazards such as hurricanes and tsunamis and the inevitable everyday risks of anchoring ships and fisher trollers that sever the physical cables, as well as the more intentional based threats of hybrid warfare and the growing presence of authoritarian state control of subsea cables and hubs.  

This paper aims to bring awareness to the often overlooked but heavily relied on piece of critical infrastructure, the subsea cable network. Emphasizing why the network is important to secure, why the current legal frameworks regulating the cable network seem inadequate and offering some recommendations for moving forward.  

**Part I: Introduction**  
If you woke up this morning and logged on to social media, answered an email you received overnight, or clicked on a news article that showed up on your phone, it most likely linked you to the global internet. It appeared on your phone after traveling through some part of the 552-fiber optic cable network that lies on the ocean floor. Given the expansive growth of the internet, the implementation of cloud storage, and the COVID-19 pandemic forcing the world to shift to doing most things online, we rely on this subsea cable network more than ever before. However, there are inadequate protections in place to secure such a heavily relied-on piece of communication infrastructure.  

**A. What Is the Subsea Cable Network**  
The subsea cable network often referred to as the backbone or central nervous system of our global internet, consists of physical cables with a fiberoptic core that lay at the bottom of the ocean and allow for data and communication to be carried from one shore to another and ultimately reach your phone. As of early 2023, the subsea cable network consisted of roughly 552 active or planned submarine cables that connect every continent together apart from Antarctica. To offer some context three major routes include; the Trans-Atlantic which connects New York to London, the Tans-Pacific connecting Los Angeles to Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Sydney and the Americas which connects Miami to Brazil and New York.  

The most recent cable installed called the MAREA has a capacity of 224 TBPS or 224,000 GBPS, considerably greater than the FEA cable that began service in 1997 which, has a capacity of 500 GBPS. While on average, cables have a minimum life span of 25 years, they often become outdated first as new cables are developed.  

The paper continues to explore the legal frameworks and the deficiencies in the protection of subsea cables, both domestically and internationally, and proposes a course of action for securing these vital infrastructures.","The article 'Securing Subsea Cable Critical Infrastructure, Holes in the Governing Legal Framework in the United States and Internationally' discusses subsea cables extensively, including their importance, vulnerabilities, and the legal frameworks governing them.

It directly addresses the implications of threats to these cables, including the risk of them being cut, which is central to the topic.

The content highlights the critical role of subsea cables in global communications and the potential impact of disruptions, making it clear that the article meets the criterion for being on the topic of cut sea cables."

If you want to commit the greatest conceivable act of terrorism and declare a version of war against every country on the planet, you only need to take the world offline.  
  
So many facets of human life are nowadays facilitated by a giant machine called “the internet,” which networks the world to unlock all kinds technological convenience. By instantaneously moving information from one place to another, the internet touches everything we depend on in 2016 — our transportation systems, our mortgage payments, and our Amazon purchases alike. To say goodbye to it permanently wouldn’t be like losing a limb; it would require a whole new worldview.  
  
Malicious actors have previously made parts of the internet disappear for some people. It happened as recently as October, when a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against a company called Dyn temporarily made A-list services like Reddit, Twitter, and Spotify evaporate. Acting as a type of phone book for the internet, Dyn provides domain name system services to these and many more sites, so when you type, say, “www.facebook.com” into your browser, Dyn translates this into the numerical IP address of the server you want to access.  
  
Though many computers were involved in the attack against Dyn, it theoretically would have taken only one person to steer the ship. The weapon of choice for these situations is a “botnet,” or a collection of private computers infected by the same malware, granting a third party some control over these machines. A botnet of a few thousand infected computers could be used for everything from sending spam email messages to manipulating online polls.  
  
But can one person take down the entire internet? “The answer is no,” says Gleb Budman, CEO of BackBlaze, a backup company and cloud storage provider. “Even the large-scale attack against Dyn still only knocked out certain sites down for certain people for certain amounts of time. That myth is busted.”  
  
It’s difficult to cripple the web because it’s extremely robust. In his book *Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet*, author Andrew Blum calls it a “network of networks” — it has no single off switch, but is instead a collection of layered systems that interact with each other to keep us online and connected at all costs.  
  
But consider a smaller nation like New Zealand, connected to the rest of the world by just two cables. With a couple serious snips in the right place, an entire country gets knocked offline (divers in Egypt were caught doing exactly this in 2013). If this seems like a like an obvious problem deserving a resilient solution, you’re right: The consensus is that these essential cables are “surprisingly vulnerable.” Earthquakes, deep sea divers, large anchors, and even sharks have taken areas of the globe offline for a few days to a few months.  
  
In 2015, someone carried out a mysterious series of attacks on the West Coast’s fiber optic cable system. Again, the method was low-tech but effective: By climbing down manholes and cutting cables, the actor was able to slow California’s internet speeds and even interrupt Microsoft’s enterprise service, Azure. If that effort were carried out at a larger scale, or deep in a remote part of the ocean, it would wreak a lasting havoc difficult to recover from.  
  
And since it’s common today for those in the developing world to manage their entire relationship with the internet through an iOS- or Android-powered mobile phone, “if something happened to shut off the internet in these systems, half the world loses its connectivity,” says Budman.  
  
This consolidation of resources hasn’t really been seen before in the history of the internet, which was born as random, varied servers popped up all over the place. But we are accessing the internet in an increasingly homogenous way; a hack or flaw in these dominant systems — or a questionable decision by Google and Apple — could make the internet disappear for more than a third of the 3.2 billion people who access it each year.  
  
There is simultaneously relief and caution here. No one person could permanently dismantle the internet, but if a savvy-enough group of people acted together to jam networks and attack physical infrastructure, then we’d all have to start reading books again.","The article discusses the vulnerability of undersea cables and provides specific examples of incidents where cables were cut, such as the 2013 incident in Egypt.

When cable cuts occur, whether submarine or terrestrial, they often result in observable disruptions to Internet connectivity, knocking a network, city, or country offline. This is especially true when there is insufficient resilience or alternative paths — that is, when a cable is effectively a single point of failure. Associated observations of traffic loss resulting from these disruptions are frequently covered by Cloudflare Radar in social media and blog posts. However, two recent cable cuts that occurred in the Baltic Sea resulted in little-to-no observable impact to the affected countries, as we discuss below, in large part because of the significant redundancy and resilience of Internet infrastructure in Europe.

#### BCS East-West Interlink

On Sunday, November 17 2024, the BCS East-West Interlink submarine cable connecting Sventoji, Lithuania and Katthammarsvik, Sweden was reportedly damaged around 10:00 local (Lithuania) time (08:00 UTC). A Data Center Dynamics article about the cable cut quotes the CTO of Telia Lietuva, the telecommunications provider that operates the cable, and notes, ""The Lithuanian cable carried about a third of the nation's Internet capacity, but capacity was carried via other routes.""

As the Cloudflare Radar graphs below show, there was no apparent impact to traffic volumes in either country at the time that the cables were damaged.

#### C-Lion1

Less than a day later, the C-Lion1 submarine cable, which connects Helsinki, Finland and Rostock Germany was reportedly damaged during the early morning hours of Monday, November 18. Cinia, the telecommunications company that owns the cable, said that the cable stopped working at about 02:00 UTC.

In this situation as well, as the Cloudflare Radar graphs below show, there was no apparent impact to traffic volumes in either country at the time that the cables were damaged.

#### Conclusion

As discussed, cable cuts often cause significant disruptions to Internet connectivity, in many cases because they represent a concentrated point of vulnerability. Building redundant and resilient network architecture is a best practice. The Cloudflare Radar team continually monitors the status of Internet connectivity in countries/regions around the world, sharing observations on the Cloudflare Radar Outage Center and via social media.","The article discusses the topic of cut sea cables in detail, including specific incidents involving submarine cables in the Baltic Sea and their impact on internet connectivity.

"How the Internet May Be Taken Down","Explores the vulnerability of undersea cables, with 99% of global web traffic reliant on them, and the potential for strategic disruptions to affect international communications.","https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/business/how-the-internet-may-be-taken-down","2024-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","Bill Kleyman",Yes,"Bill Kleyman","San Francisco, California, US","5000","2024-04-22","English","Data Center Knowledge","We’ve all seen some of the latest apocalyptic movies with some pretty epic reasons for losing Internet, electricity and other modern technologies. What’s interesting is that a lot of these reasons are far-fetched and aren’t always entirely realistic.

So here is where you pose a really challenging question: How, in today’s world, can the Internet completely go down?

Before we get into “how” – we have to understand “what” the Internet really is. At a very high-level, the Internet is a vast interconnected network of data centers spanning the globe. These data centers have exchange points, protocols and routes that they have to follow. With every year that passes, the Internet becomes more and more resilient. Why? Because at this point, Internet communication is absolutely critical to the survival of our current society.

To really understand just how complex the Internet will be, here is the entire Internet network, in all of its glory.

We know the Internet is huge and that there are a lot of connections. So how can all of this fail? Well, there are a few ways.

### Cutting the wires
Bringing down a couple - or even all - of the satellites will actually do little to cut Internet traffic. Yes, it will cause an amazing amount of issues, but the Internet will most likely live on. At this point, roughly 99 percent of global Web traffic is dependent on deep-sea networks of fiber-optic cables that blanket the ocean floor like a nervous system. These are major tangible targets – creating very real choke points in the system.

Consider this: As much as three-fourths of the international communications between the Middle East and Europe have been carried by two undersea cables, FLAG Telecom's FLAG Europe-Asia cable. To make things movie-worthy, you can’t just cut the wires. Why? Because they’re designed to be fixed. However, a strategic strike that will take out the fiber optic cables or damage the entire wire will do the trick. If this is done at choke points you can disable or almost completely halt global Internet traffic.

### Destroy root servers
It’s much easier to go to Google.com than to type in 74.125.225.131. That’s what root servers do – they are responsible for decoding .com, .net, .org. names before aligning them with the correct IP address. If you take out these servers, the Internet will no longer recognize the alphabet when you type in an address.

Here’s the interesting part: there are ""only"" 13 servers that do this. Effectively, if you take these servers down, the only way to “browse” the Internet will be with a physical piece of paper, a pen and a really good memory around numbers.

### Cyber warfare/political
China, Iran, North Korea, Syria and a few other folks already have an “Internet Kill Switch.” We’ve seen an entire country go dark. What if the U.S. had this switch? What about the EU? What if there were secret programs (NSA-style) that had complete control of the Internet from a kill-switch perspective? Here’s the interesting part – what if it broke?

### Take out the data centers
This is a possibility. The modern data center does indeed house all of the major components around the Internet. So, why not cut the wires AND take down the data centers? For those exchange points – TelX, Equinix, NAP, TeleHouse, GlobalSwitch are all major data center carriers. They have around-clock-security. However, even the most secured facilities can be broken into.

### Massive solar event
From a catastrophe perspective, this is a bit cliché but it is possible. If there is a major solar flare - or a large solar storm – communications can be affected. Still, the enormity of this storm would probably cause issues outside of just the Internet going down.

### Remove key people
By far the MOST resilient part of the Internet is the people that support it. When in absolute dire emergencies, people have been known to do amazing things to fix and resolve issues.

Ultimately, there will be other people that can help rebuild what needs to be put in place for the Internet to work. The question becomes the goal of the outage or the attack.

First Block Island, offshore Rhode Island, and now wind farms offshore Europe are experiencing problems with transmission cables requiring millions of dollars of investments. The Block Island offshore wind farm, a 30-megawatt facility off the coast of Rhode Island, found that its high voltage cables that carry electricity to land were not buried deep enough and were being exposed as the seabed was being worn away by tides and storms, making the exposed cables dangerous to swimmers. National Grid and Ørsted, the current owner, are replacing the cable to a greater depth, which state regulators had originally wanted, but were over-ruled by a state board supportive of the project. National Grid, which owns the cable that connects the island to the mainland, will charge customers of the Narragansett Electric Company to fix its portion of the problem. National Grid’s reconstruction cost is expected to be $30 million and it will be recovered through an undetermined surcharge on ratepayers’ bills. Ørsted’s cost, which cannot be passed on, is unknown. This is a costly undertaking.

Ørsted, a Danish Company that is the world’s largest developer of offshore wind projects, also found that some of its transmission cables connecting wind farms to European towns have been damaged by scraping against rocks that had been placed on the seabed to prevent erosion. The cost to fix the problems will be as much as 3 billion Danish kroner ($489 million). The company identified 10 projects in the U.K. and Europe that used the same design and that may need to be repaired. Some projects can be fixed by putting more rocks on top of the cables to make them stay in place. In other cases, the cables will have to be repaired or replaced, which is where the major cost is. Laying cables on top of rocks was the industry standard at the time these wind farms were built several years ago, but is no longer used by offshore wind developers. Ørsted may not be the only company facing these problems in Europe as other offshore wind farms may have similar issues with their cable layout.

**Ørsted and National Grid’s Cable Fix for Block Island Wind Farm**

Offshore wind farms involve a network of turbines with cables that connect to shore and into the power grid. The reconstruction project requires replacing approximately 520 meters of National Grid’s sea2shore submarine cable that carries electricity between Block Island and mainland Rhode Island, and approximately 945 meters of Ørsted’s subsea cable that carries electricity from the wind farm to Block Island. The original cables were installed in the spring/summer of 2016.

Ørsted and National Grid determined the best approach to maintain the required burial depths of the two transmission cables is to reinstall these limited segments with new sections adjacent to where the existing cables are now situated. The cable landings will be constructed using a horizontal directional drill and a conduit will be installed for the new length of onshore cable. The horizontal directional drill will bury the cables at a depth of between eight to 15 meters below the seafloor, compared with the current 1.2 to 1.8 meters.

The new cables will be spliced onto the existing cable that connects the Island, the wind project, and the mainland. The existing portions of the exposed cables are scheduled to be removed at the end of construction.

Block Island and Rhode Island will continue to receive electricity from the wind farm during the reconstruction, except for a brief outage when the new cable will be spliced with the existing cable. During the outage, Block Island Power Company will provide the needed electrical power to the Island using its on-island diesel generation. The anticipated project completion date is before the end of May 2021.

**Biden’s Offshore Wind Plan**

President Biden’s plan to reach net zero carbon dioxide emissions in the generating sector includes the installation of some 30,000 megawatts of new offshore wind capacity by 2030, the equivalent of 1,000 Block Island projects. Building 30,000 megawatts of capacity will require “massive industrialization” of the oceans, anchoring thousands of offshore platforms along the coasts that could pose significant threats to navigation, marine mammals and fisheries. It is important to note that “capacity” is not “output” with intermittent renewable sources and that large offshore wind projects are expected to average a 51 percent “capacity factor” by 2022. Therefore, just over 15,000 megawatts of actual available power can be obtained from the 30,000 megawatts Biden has proposed.

Offshore wind is far more expensive than other generating technologies, including coal, natural gas, nuclear power and onshore renewable energy, according to the Energy Information Administration. In 2026, the agency estimates that producing one megawatt-hour of electricity from offshore wind will cost about $121–almost double the cost of generating that same amount of energy with an advanced nuclear reactor ($69), more than three times the projected cost of producing it with natural gas ($37), and even more than coal ($73). Large increases in electricity prices will be particularly harmful to low- and middle-income consumers and particularly painful in New York and New England, where consumers already pay some of America’s highest electricity prices.

And, as Block Island and European offshore wind projects indicate, costly repairs may be needed as well after the wind farms are built.

**Conclusion**

The first-hand experience with the Block Island wind project is indicative of the future pitfalls that the U.S. offshore wind industry can expect as it continues toward replacing existing traditional generating technologies with offshore wind to meet Biden’s quotas. Offshore wind is expensive and should not be pushed onto Americans as a major way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions when other energy forms are available that are less expensive.","The article discusses transmission cables related to offshore wind projects, focusing on problems experienced by the Block Island wind farm and Ørsted's projects in Europe.

*January 20, 2012*  

The coming threats to the global Internet could take many forms.  

The raging battle over SOPA and PIPA, the proposed anti-piracy laws, is looking more and more likely to end in favor of Internet freedom — but it won't be the last battle of its kind. Although, ethereal as it is, the Internet seems destined to survive in some form or another, experts warn that there are many threats to its status quo existence, and there is much about it that could be ruined or lost.  

**Physical destruction**  
A vast behemoth that can route around outages and self-heal, the Internet has grown physically invulnerable to destruction by bombs, fires or natural disasters — within countries, at least. It's ""very richly interconnected,"" said David Clark, a computer scientist at MIT who was a leader in the development of the Internet during the 1970s. ""You would have to work real hard to find a small number of places where you could seriously disrupt connectivity."" On 9/11, for example, the destruction of the major switching center in south Manhattan disrupted service locally. But service was restored about 15 minutes later when the center ""healed"" as the built-in protocols routed users and information around the outage.  

However, while it's essentially impossible to cripple connectivity internally in a country, Clark said it is conceivable that one country could block another's access to its share of the Internet cloud; this could be done by severing the actual cables that carry Internet data between the two countries. Thousands of miles of undersea fiber-optic cables that convey data from continent to continent rise out of the ocean in only a few dozen locations, branching out from those hubs to connect to millions of computers. But if someone were to blow up one of these hubs — the station in Miami, for example, which handles some 90 percent of the Internet traffic between North America and Latin America — the Internet connection between the two would be severely hampered until the infrastructure was repaired.  

Such a move would be ""an act of cyberwar,"" Clark told Life's Little Mysteries.  

**Content cache**  
Even an extreme disruption of international connectivity would not seriously threaten the survival of Web content itself. A ""hard"" copy of most data is stored in nonvolatile memory, which sticks around with or without power, and whether you have Internet access to it or not. Furthermore, according to William Lehr, an MIT economist who studies the economics and regulatory policy of the Internet-infrastructure industries, the corporate data centers that harbor Web content — everything from your emails to this article — have sophisticated ways to back up and diversely store the data, including simply storing copies in multiple locations.  

Google even stores cached copies of all Wikipedia pages; these were accessible on Jan. 18 when Wikipedia took its own versions of the pages offline in protest of SOPA and PIPA.  

This diversified storage plan keeps the content itself safe, but it also offers some protection against loss of access to any one copy of the data in the event of a cyberwar. For example, if power were cut to a server, you may be unable to reach a website on its home server, but you may find a cached version of the content stored on another, accessible server. Or, ""If you wanted data that was not available from a server in country X, you may be able to get substantively the same data from a server in country Y,"" Lehr said.  

**Internet arms race**  
The redundancy of so much online content and of connectivity routes makes the Internet resilient to physical attacks, but a much more serious threat to its status quo existence is government regulation or censorship. In the early days of Egypt's Arab Spring uprising, the government of Hosni Mubarak attempted to shut down the country's Internet in order to cripple protesters' ability to organize; it did this by ordering the state-controlled Internet Service Provider (ISP), which grants Internet access to customers, to cut service.  

""ISPs have direct control of the Internet, so what happens in any country depends on the control that the state has over those ISPs,"" Clark said at the time. ""Some countries regulate the ISPs much more heavily. China has in the past 'turned off' the Internet in various regions.""  

However, in Egypt last year, many protesters found ways to bootstrap connectivity and bypass the shut-off, such as by using smartphones to communicate with the global Internet over cellular networks and tapping into private companies' Intranet connections. ""[A] lot of the connectivity to protesters was provided by workers who made access available to their business networks,"" Lehr said.  

If, in future, the U.S. government sought to shut down or limit Internet access, similar workarounds would crop up, and they would grow more sophisticated as the regulatory methods became more extreme — a ""weapons race,"" Lehr called it. ""The tools for fighting the war are mostly defensive (fire walls, shutting down interconnects, monitoring, locking up folks who have violated 'laws') but also can be offensive (viruses to attack hostile websites/destroy content, locking folks up preemptively, etc.).""  

Governments could also simply tax Internet access, or providers could jack up the prices, in such a way as to price it out of reach of most people.  

Lehr added that, while no single government could destroy the Internet everywhere, it could certainly cripple it sufficiently to render its use unattractive for people within its country of governance.  

**In the balance**  
Bad regulation, be it in any particular country or on the international scale, could severely hamper the Internet's value and its ability to grow, Lehr said. While some version of the Internet is likely to exist as long as humanity does, what might be lost or greatly diminished is ""the openness of the Internet.""  

This openness is useful both economically and socially, but it is also a source of problems, Lehr noted; it lends itself to endless security and privacy attacks, junk mail, viruses, malware and so on. He believes new security models must be developed to protect privacy and security while still allowing the Internet to function.  

""Whether we can effectively strike that balance is a difficult challenge and work in progress.""

**Author:** Lixian Loong Hantover  
**Published Date:** 05/17/2016  

**Abstract:**  
Our data is moving into the cloud. While in the past we stored data on the computers on our desks, now we increasingly give control of our data to far-away professionals and give up our hard drives for storage online in the “cloud.” A PEW report in 2008 found that sixty-nine percent of Americans had either stored files online or used a web-based software application at least once. Now over one exabyte, or over one billion gigabytes, of data is stored among the many cloud services like Gmail and Dropbox. Amazon’s S3 cloud storage service, which provides the cloud storage space for companies like Dropbox, stores 762 billion objects. That is enough for 108 objects per person on earth. In 2013, the cloud market is predicted to grow by 18.5 percent. By 2016, it is estimated that users will store more than one third of their digital content in the cloud.  

It is not just individuals accessing their documents via Dropbox that make up this migration to the cloud. Companies looking to save on expensive hardware and the salaries of the IT professionals required to maintain that expensive hardware are also looking toward the cloud for their own data storage. Because individuals and businesses increasingly rely on the cloud to perform basic functions, reliable access to that cloud is not merely important – it is critical. The concerns about cloud storage are thus two-fold: the security of the data itself and the security of our access to that data. This article focuses on the latter concern. Specifically, this article focuses on the security of one critical component of the global Internet infrastructure that we use to access the cloud: undersea cables. These cables once carried only transatlantic telegraph messages. Now they carry any kind of communication – telephone calls, emails, bank account transfers – across the globe. Accessing files from the cloud is just one of the many ways we rely on this infrastructure.  

As cloud storage grows and multinational companies begin to rely on these cables to access their files, the potential economic impact of a breach of these cables becomes catastrophic. This article argues that the growth in cloud storage has raised the stakes when it comes to undersea cable security by making our ability to access our day-to-day files dependent on them. Furthermore, it is unclear who, if anyone, would be responsible for the economic loss associated with a loss of access to those files. Part II of this article explores the idea of cloud storage and how access to information in the cloud has become a global issue that relies on undersea cables. It examines the structural flaws in undersea cable security and the inability of the current legal system to compensate victims for the loss of access to data in the event of a breach of undersea cable security.  

Part III explores and critiques various solutions to ensure that access to data in the cloud remains safe from undersea cable breaches and that any economic loss due to cable breaches can be compensated. This article then advocates in Part IV for a solution that includes a shift of liability to cloud storage providers and increased redundancy requirements.","The article discusses the critical role of undersea cables in global internet infrastructure and how their security is vital for accessing cloud storage.

It directly mentions 'undersea cables' and examines the implications of potential breaches, making it a central theme of the article.

The discussions include economic impacts and legal considerations related to undersea cable security, fulfilling the criterion for being on the topic of cut sea cables."

Any young, new industry will have growing pains, and the offshore wind farm industry is no different. Among other issues with offshore wind farms, one of the biggest problems to affect the industry are issues with subsea cables. Failures and issues during installation and maintenance of subsea cables have cost companies millions of dollars and have caused many delays in this new and quickly rising industry.

While much information on cable issues is closely guarded, there have been some high profile cases as well as some studies done regarding damage to offshore wind farms. One of these studies, conducted by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), partially delves into issues specific to subsea cables. Failure statistics have shown that third party mechanical damage to cables is three to five times more likely than the risk of internal cable failures. A few examples of third-party subsea cable damage include:

* **Jackup “Jacked Up” On a Cable:** One issue is the risk of Jackups “Jacking Up” on a cable. A Jackup is a floating barge fitted with long support legs that can be raised or lowered to service oil and gas platforms or wind turbines. According to the study by the BSEE, there have been issues with cables getting caught in the jackup and being damaged in the equipment.

* **Anchors Damage To Cable:** Another common issue is damage from third party anchors. Often times, anchors of laying vessels will tangle with the cable being laid and cause damage to the cable.

* **Cable Kinked:** Perhaps one of the most common issues with subsea cables is their tendency to kink or bend. It is very easy to get a kink into the line when preparing to install cables and unkinking is a major exercise requiring special skills.

In addition to these issues, other common problems to cable installation can include: damage to cable during installation, weather or soil-related damage, cable or joint failure, or sediment movement that can lead to cable exposure.

Subsea cables are complicated pieces of equipment and need to be handled with care and should only be used with only the best cable hardware to promote longevity and fortification. PMI is ready to equip your cables with the highest quality cable hardware.

Britain risks being vulnerable to enemy action, including cyber attacks, unless adequate resources are urgently devoted to the nation’s defence, the head of the British Army will warn today in a keynote speech.

Pointing to conventional threats, General Sir Nick Carter will stress that Vladimir Putin’s Russia has built an aggressive military force which this “country would struggle to match”. He will describe how the Kremlin has been ready to use its advanced capabilities in conflicts in Syria and Ukraine.

At the same time, the Chief of General Staff will speak of clandestine cyber offensives from abroad which can affect not only public institutions, but the lives of ordinary people in this country.

General Carter’s address, at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) comes at a time when the Government has come under severe criticism from politicians and former senior military officers for cutting back on defence spending. At the same time Russia has been blamed for cyber warfare on the West with claims of the US and European elections, as well as the Brexit referendum being targeted.

The Kremlin has showed its military prowess in the battlefield with missile strikes 1500km away in Syria. At the same time, Gen Carter maintains it has kept up constant sabre-rattling in Europe with simulated attacks.

“Our ability to pre-empt or respond to threats will be eroded if we don’t keep up with our adversaries. State-based competition is now being employed in more novel and increasingly integrated ways and we must be ready to deal with them,” Gen Carter will say.

General Sir Nick Carter says the UK is unprepared for modern warfare such as cyber attacks.

“The threats we face are not thousands of miles away but are now on Europe’s doorstep – we have seen how cyber warfare can be both waged on the battlefield and to disrupt normal people’s lives. We in the UK are not immune from that.”

“We must take notice of what is going on around us or our ability to take action will be massively constrained. Speed of decision-making, speed of deployment and modern capability are essential if we wish to provide a realistic deterrence. The time to address these threats is now – we cannot afford to sit back.”

Britain and the West also need to be aware that conventional threats are still very present. “The traditional threat still remains and last year we saw Russia undertake simulated attacks across Northern Europe (from Kaliningrad to Lithuania), we must also look closely at how countries are now being more creative in how they exploit the seams between peace and war.”

Last month the head of the Armed Forces, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach warned that Russia poses a threat to Britain's internet access and trade because undersea communication cables are vulnerable to the country’s navy. Russia’s “modernised” navy has the ability to disrupt the transcontinental cables and that the UK had to bolster its naval forces to counter the threat.

Defence analysts have pointed out that the UK currently has had no submarine-hunting maritime patrol aircraft since 2010 while ships and submarines which could also protect the cables have fallen too.

The Chief of the Defence Staff gave the speech only days after a think tank said an attack on the cables would deal a “crippling blow” to security and commerce and the “threat is nothing short of existential.","The article discusses the UK's military readiness in the context of threats from Russia, specifically mentioning the vulnerability of undersea communication cables to Russian naval actions.

It states that an attack on these cables would significantly impact internet access and trade, and highlights the existential threat posed by such vulnerabilities.

This aligns directly with the criterion for being on the topic of cut sea cables, as it treats the subject with importance rather than as a minor mention."

*   Around 150 subsea cable faults occur annually, usually caused by accidental damage from a ship’s anchor or fishing trawler.
*   Despite this, the recent subsea cable faults in the Baltic Sea has caused many to speculate foul play.
*   The narrative of the story should highlight the resilience of subsea cables and the Internet as a whole to continue working despite these and other faults.

Around 99% of all Internet traffic runs through nearly 600 subsea cable systems worldwide. These (primarily) fiber optic connections are the latest generation of a more than 160-year-old practice of spanning seas, lakes, and oceans with watertight cables to carry telecommunications traffic.

Governments and the general public are increasingly aware of these systems. Still, this awareness usually comes in the form of stories about suspected attacks on them, and these stories are only sometimes grounded in evidence.

Two subsea cables (C-LIon and BCS East-West Interlink) in the Baltic Sea were reportedly damaged on 17 and 18 November 2024.

Governments in the region responded quickly. The foreign ministers of Finland and Germany issued a joint statement saying that European security is at risk from ""hybrid warfare by malicious actors."" CNN quickly picked up on this, implying that it was the explanation. Boris Pistorius, Germany’s Defense Minister, even said, ""Nobody believes that these cables were accidentally severed.""

In contrast, the European Subsea Cables Association, an industry body that promotes the protection of subsea infrastructure, also responded that there isn’t enough evidence to draw a clear conclusion. They emphasized that this early speculation can be a catalyst for spreading misinformation and “leads to unhelpful and premature conclusions being drawn about the cause of cable damage.""

Human interaction is the most common cause of cable damage, usually accidental damage from a ship’s anchor or fishing trawler. It’s not possible to speculate on this incident, especially since the investigation isn’t finished, just to note that “human activity” as a cause does not clarify intent.

Cable Breaks Are Common
-----------------------

Around 150 cable faults—breakage or other types of damage—occur globally each year, and the industry is always prepared for them. Repair kits are kept in ports, and when a cable is damaged, one of the world’s 60 cable ships—there are always some on standby—is dispatched to pick up the kit and travel out to lift the cable from the seabed and repair it.

Until recently, the biggest myth the industry had to address was that shark bites were a risk to cables (they aren’t). In 2024, it seems every subsea cable fault without an immediate and obvious explanation is met with alarmist language from governments, which is picked up by the media, looking for a good story about international conflict rather than listening to industry experts.

If it does emerge that this most recent cable fault has a national security dimension, the authorities might never be able to share it fully. In this instance, it’s also helpful to note that there was little impact on the Internet for users. The traffic was successfully rerouted, with a bit of extra latency but no meaningful increase in packet loss.

The Baltic Sea Context
----------------------

The Baltic Sea countries have been well-served by subsea cables since the mid-1990s when a combination of deregulation and post-Cold War activity helped trigger a boom in cable construction between the Nordic countries and the former East.

The Baltic cables are mostly what are called “unrepeatered” systems. These are used over shorter distances and don’t need a repeater as an internal power source, as the deep-sea cables that cross oceans do. Using an unrepeatered system is usually determined by geography, but these systems also provide extra route redundancy, which can lead to increased resilience of the overall network.

Resilience is the Result of Continuous Human Activity
-----------------------------------------------------

It’s important not to dismiss security concerns, but telling stories of resilience can help ensure that the combative language doesn’t wholly overshadow one of society’s most critical infrastructures. 

When we look from a human-centered perspective, it’s still possible to account for security threats. We also activate the stories of the “network of networks” of people who are the reason that we never even know about the other 148 or so cable faults each year—or why the faults don’t happen at all.

10 March 2015  
By Chris Baraniuk, Features correspondent  
  
What would it take to bring down the internet?  
  
The internet is unbreakable. At least, we think it is. That’s why when something goes extremely viral, such as pictures of Kim Kardashian’s bottom or #thedress, we joke about it ""breaking the internet"". But could you really, literally, break the internet?  
  
Part of the answer lies in London’s Docklands district: nestled just north-east of Canary Wharf is a large, unassuming building. It houses a substantial node in the internet. It’s called ""Linx"", the London Internet Exchange, and it’s one of the biggest points of traffic exchange on the internet.  
  
These buildings, scattered across the globe, are where networks come together to exchange their traffic. If any of them were cut off – by a power cut or earthquake – we would know about it.  
  
What would happen if we cut the cables under the sea? Not as much as you might think. There are uncountable miles of cables wrapped around the globe, and many of the biggest are just lying there unprotected – albeit often underwater. It’s believed that significant internet disruptions in 2008 that affected countries including Egypt were caused by these sort of cable breaks.  
  
But the effects of these failures aren’t as far-reaching as you might think, because they come up against the original designed resilience of the system.  
  
The internet’s wonderful capacity to re-route traffic could be used against it. One such way is a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, where a huge flow of traffic is deliberately sent to servers which can’t cope with the overload. DDoS attacks are becoming more common.  
  
Another major concern is BGP hijacking. This is a key system which tells internet traffic where to go. In recent years, however, it emerged that traffic could be re-directed if the destination information logged in the routers got manipulated.  
  
However, there’s never been a case where the whole internet has gone down. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t think about the possibility, though.  
  
Vincent Chan, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, points out that physical attacks on the internet’s infrastructure are unlikely to do much permanent damage. But what if you find a software vulnerability that affects all nodes? Then you’ve got a problem.  
  
In conclusion, while there are many ways to disrupt the internet, a complete breakdown remains theoretical.

The Russian navy is very proud of its new spy ship, the Yantar, which is now doing Argentina a favour by helping to search for a missing submarine.

Enter the Yantar, officially an oceanographic research vessel, but actually bristling with surveillance equipment, and the mother ship for manned and unmanned deep-sea submersibles.

The Yantar's movements were apparently what prompted a warning last month from the UK military that Russia could disrupt or cut vital undersea communications cables.

Dozens of fibre-optic cables span the globe and NATO also has dedicated military cables on the ocean floor.

The Yantar is capable of tampering with them, says Igor Sutyagin, a London-based expert on the Russian military. But there is no evidence that it has done so.

Mr Sutyagin noted that in the 1970s, during the Cold War, the US Navy had lost control of a Sosus undersea listening post for tracking submarines in the Atlantic. The US military concluded that a Soviet submarine had cut the cables.

A news report from the Russian parliament says the Yantar can do just such clandestine work, using deep-diving submersibles.

Mr Sutyagin, of the Royal United Services Institute, says the Yantar belongs to Russia's Main Directorate of Underwater Research (GUGI in Russian), part of the defence ministry.

The 108m-long vessel has a crew of 60 and went into service in 2015. It was built in the Baltic port of Kaliningrad, the first in a series called Project 22010.

The Yantar can deploy the three-man submersibles Rus and Konsul, which can dive to about 6,000m.

The Russian parliamentary report noted that in the summer of 2015 the Yantar had deployed near the US Kings Bay naval base in Georgia. 

In late 2016 the Yantar was found to be loitering over undersea communications cables off the Syrian coast, including some links to Europe.

Besides the Argentina mission, the Yantar has been used previously for search and recovery. The ship had located two Russian fighter jets that crashed into the Mediterranean in 2016, during the Syria war. 

In 2000 a ship like the Yantar might have saved some Kursk sailors' lives and literally salvaged the Russian navy's reputation.","The article discusses the Russian spy ship Yantar and its capabilities, specifically mentioning its potential to disrupt or cut vital undersea communications cables.

This seems a very modern problem. However, in 1917, the United States and the British faced a similar problem.

On February 1, 1917, Germany launched unrestricted submarine warfare. Two days later the United States broke off diplomatic relations and began the slide toward war. On February 7, the British post office completed a study of what we would today call trans-Atlantic bandwidth to determine how much telegraph capacity would be available to an American Expeditionary Force that might be sent to France. The study observed that there were 17 submarine telegraph cables connecting Europe and North America, two of them German. However, seven of the 17 were interrupted and three more were faulty. The overall transmission capacity of this degraded system was about 1.2 million words or 7.8 million letters per week in each direction.

In early April, with the American declaration of war just days away, the British shared the study with the United States. The Americans were dismayed. Radio transmissions could take up some of the burden, but they realized that this technology could pick up only a tiny proportion of the trans-Atlantic communications burden.

Then things got worse. In mid-February, a German U-boat cut a series of cables connecting Britain, Portugal, Gibraltar, and the Azores. To compound the matter, in the summer of 1917, the German Navy began planning a major offensive against the cables. They equipped submarines with specialized grapples and cutting equipment and launched their effort, which continued as late as September 1918.

As a result, the U.S. government had to struggle throughout the war to conduct its military, naval, and diplomatic business overseas. The Atlantic cable bottleneck had other strategic implications, as well. Ultimately, the system adapted to the inadequacies of the trans-Atlantic cable system and the German efforts to exacerbate them. While the United States was unable to operate as it might have wanted during World War I because of the submarine cable problem, it learned and made itself stronger and more resilient.

"Threats to Undersea Cables: Understanding the Risks to Internet Connectivity","Explores the impact of severed undersea cables on global communication, featuring incidents like Tonga's disruption and discussing geopolitical risks.","https://artshumanities.berkeley.edu/news/guardian-what-lies-beneath-growing-threat-hidden-network-cables-power-internet","2024-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","Jonathan Yerushalmy",Yes,"Jonathan Yerushalmy","Berkeley, California, USA","122000","2024-08-08","English","University of California, Berkeley","It was the opening days of 2022, in the aftermath of a huge volcanic eruption, when Tonga went dark. The underwater eruption – 1,000 times more powerful than the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima – sent tsunami waves across Tonga’s nearby archipelago and blanketed the island’s white coral sands in ash.

The strength of the Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha’apai eruption severed internet connectivity with Tonga, causing a communication blackout at just the moment that a crisis was unfolding.

When the undersea cable that provides the country’s internet was restored weeks later, the scale of the disruption was clear. The lack of connectivity had hampered recovery efforts, while at the same time devastating businesses and local finances, many of which depend on remittances from abroad.

The disaster exposed the extreme vulnerabilities of the infrastructure that underpins the workings of the internet.

Contemporary life is really inseparable from an operational internet, says Nicole Starosielski, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley and the author of The Undersea Network.

In that way, it’s much like drinking water – a utility that underpins our very existence. And like water, very few people understand what it takes for it to travel from a distant reservoir to our kitchen taps.

Modern consumers have come to imagine the internet as something unseen in the atmosphere – an invisible “cloud” just above our heads, raining data down upon us. Because our devices aren’t tethered to any cables, many of us believe the whole thing is wireless, says Starosielski, but the reality is far more extraordinary.

Almost all internet traffic – including Zoom calls, movie streams, emails and social media feeds – reach us via high speed fibre optics laid on the ocean floor. These are the veins of the modern world, stretching almost 1.5 million km under the sea, connecting countries via physical cables which funnel the internet through them.

Speaking via WhatsApp, Starosielski explains that the data transmitting her voice will travel from her mobile phone to a nearby cell tower. “That’s basically the only wireless hop in the entire system,” she says.

From the cell tower, it will go through a set of terrestrial fibre optic cables, travelling at the speed of light underground. It will then go to a cable landing station – usually somewhere near the water – and from there to the bottom of the seafloor, before coming up at a cable landing station in Australia, from where the Guardian is speaking to Starosielski.

Spies, sabotage and sharks

That the data that powers financial, government, and some military communications is traversing cables not much thicker than a hose pipe and protected by little more than the seawater above them, has in recent years become a cause of concern for lawmakers across the world.

In 2017, Nato officials reported that Russian submarines had stepped up their surveillance of internet cables in the north Atlantic and in 2018, the Trump administration sanctioned a Russian company that was alleged to have provided “underwater capabilities” to Moscow, with the aim of monitoring the underwater network.

A Russian attack on undersea cables would cause “significant damage to our economy and to our everyday lives,” Jim Langevin, a member of the US house armed services committee said at the time.

The targeting of internet cables is a weapon that Russia has long held in its arsenal of hybrid warfare. When Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, Moscow severed the main cable connection to the peninsula, gaining control of its internet infrastructure, enabling the Kremlin to spread disinformation.

Global conflicts have also been shown to have unintended, disruptive effects on internet cable systems. In February, Iranian-backed Houthi militants attacked a cargo ship in the Red Sea. The eventual sinking of the Rubymar was likely responsible for severing three undersea cables in the region, which disrupted a significant portion of internet traffic between Asia and Europe.

The US and its allies have also expressed serious concern that adversaries could tap into the undersea cables to obtain “personal information, data, and communications.” A 2022 congressional report on the issue highlighted the increased potential of Russia or China to access the undersea cable systems.

It’s a method of espionage that the US is all too familiar with: in 2013 the Guardian revealed that the UK’s GCHQ had tapped into the network of internet cables to access vast quantities of communications between entirely innocent people, as well as targeted suspects. This information was then passed on to the NSA.

The documents, revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden, also showed that an undersea cable that connects Australia and New Zealand to the US was tapped to allow the NSA to access Australian and New Zealand internet data.

Despite the raft of dangers and the increasingly vocal warning from western governments, calls for greater action in securing the cable network have largely gone unanswered and many see the threats as overblown.

“There are no publicly available and verified reports indicating deliberate attacks on the cable network by any actor, be it Russia, China, or a non-state group,” a 2022 EU report said.

“Arguably, this implies that the threat scenarios being discussed could be exaggerated.”

One expert speaking to the Guardian was blunter in their assessment, describing the threat of sabotage as “bullshit.”

The data bears this out, showing that sharks, anchors and fishing pose a greater threat to the global internet infrastructure than Russian spies. A US report on this issue showed that the major threats to the network are “accidental incidents involving humans”. On average, a cable is severed “every three days.”

“A submarine telecommunication cable was accidentally severed by a ship off the coast of Somalia in 2017, leading to a three-week internet outage costing the country $10 million a day”, the report states.

An Unequal Internet

For many experts however, the greatest risk to the internet isn’t sabotage, espionage, or even rogue anchors – but the uneven spread of the cable infrastructure that threads across the globe, binding the world’s digital networks together.

“There aren’t cables everywhere,” says Starosielski. “There is a concentration in the north Atlantic Ocean connecting the United States and Europe but there are not that many in the South Atlantic.”

“So you see that some parts of the world have a high level of connectivity … and diversity in terms of having multiple routes in case there’s a break.”

As of 2023 there were more than 500 communications cables at the bottom of the ocean, but a quick glance at the map of the world’s undersea cable networks shows they are largely centred around economic and population centres.

The unequal spread of cables is clearest in the Pacific, where a territory like Guam, with a population of just 170,000 and which houses a US naval base, has more than 10 internet cables connecting to the island. New Zealand, with more than 5 million people has seven. Tonga has just one.

In the aftermath of the 2022 eruption in Tonga, governments across the world were spurred into action, commissioning reports into the vulnerabilities within the existing undersea cable network, while tech companies worked to bolster networks to ensure such an event never occurred again.

Last month, Tonga’s internet went down again.

Huge parts of the country were left in the dark after the undersea internet cable connecting the island network was damaged, causing chaos for local businesses.

For now, the economic fundamentals favour the building of more cables across the western world and into emerging markets, where the digital demand is booming. Despite the warnings of sabotage or accidental damage – experts say that without the market imperative to create more resilient networks, the real risk is that places like Tonga will continue to go dark, threatening the very promise of digital equity that the internet was founded on.","The article discusses the importance of undersea cables for internet connectivity, detailing specific incidents where such cables were severed, including the case of Tonga after a volcanic eruption.

Published Date: 02/01/2016  

Samy Kamkar, who hacked the MySpace social network with the Samy worm in 2005, is today a white-hat hacker helping companies catch security flaws before they can be exploited.  

U.S. senator Ted Stevens (R-AK) sealed his legacy in 2006 when he infamously referred to the Internet as a ""series of tubes."" This simplistic description overlooks the intricate architecture of the Internet. Unfortunately, Stevens was not alone in misunderstanding the Internet, and ignorance can be dangerous. The physical infrastructure of the Internet can be disrupted or destroyed.  

Kamkar highlights the threat of criminals physically cutting fiber optic cables, which can cause significant disruptions. The FBI has investigated multiple attacks on fiber optic cables in California, indicating that these actions require expertise. Similar incidents have occurred globally, affecting Internet service in countries like Egypt, Pakistan, Kuwait, and India.  

Another potential attack vector is the electrical grid. Malicious actors could target SCADA systems that control the grid, leading to widespread Internet outages. The consequences of a complete Internet disruption would be severe, affecting stock markets, online transactions, and modern business operations.  

Kamkar warns that as industrial systems become more connected to the Internet, the risk of cyber-attacks increases. Future attacks could be executed remotely, exploiting vulnerabilities in connected infrastructure.  

Lastly, the erosion of trust and confidence in online systems poses a significant threat to the Internet. Privacy and security issues are prompting individuals and companies to change their behavior, potentially undermining the Internet's core values.  

In conclusion, while the physical infrastructure is critical, the software-layer trust and confidence are equally vital for the Internet's future.","The article discusses the physical cutting of fiber optic cables, detailing how such actions can disrupt internet service.

"Under the Sea: The Vulnerability of the Commons","Explores the critical role of undersea cables in global communications; discusses vulnerabilities to natural disasters and human activities.","https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/commons/under-sea","2023-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","Robert Martinage",Yes,"Robert Martinage","New York, NY, US","20000","2023-01-23","English","Foreign Affairs Magazine","In recent years, U.S. officials have grown increasingly fearful of a massive cyberattack, one capable of crippling infrastructure and crashing markets. In 2010, William Lynn, then deputy secretary of defense, wrote in these pages that cyberspace was “just as critical to military operations as land, sea, air, and space.” As defense secretary, Leon Panetta warned of a “cyber–Pearl Harbor.” And in 2013, James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, put cyberattacks at the top of his annual list of transnational threats.

Yet as Washington has poured billions of dollars into shoring up its defenses in the virtual world, it has largely ignored the physical infrastructure that allows cyberspace to exist in the real one. Today, roughly 95 percent of intercontinental communications traffic—e-mails, phone calls, money transfers, and so on—travels not by air or through space but underwater, as rays of light that traverse nearly 300 fiber-optic cables with a combined length of over 600,000 miles. For the most part, these critical lines of communication lack even basic defenses, both on the seabed and at a small number of poorly guarded landing points. And a mounting tally of small-scale breaches points to the potential for large-scale damage.

Washington’s neglect of undersea infrastructure extends beyond cables to an increasingly important source of global oil and gas supply: deep-water drilling. Today, offshore rigs in the Gulf of Mexico account for some 25 percent of total U.S. oil and gas production—a figure the Department of Energy predicts could reach 40 percent by 2040. Outside the United States, global production from deep-water wells has risen from 1.5 million barrels per day in 2000 to over six million barrels per day in 2014. As the infrastructure for offshore drilling grows more sophisticated and widespread, it is also becoming more susceptible to attack, with the potential consequences exceeding those of the giant 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

Although human activities underwater are regulated by numerous international bodies, no single entity has both the authority and the ability to take the lead. In the United States, the Coast Guard is responsible for enforcing security plans at the largest offshore energy platforms and protecting underwater structures at some ports. Yet no government agency or department has responsibility for the defense of the country’s submerged energy and cable infrastructure. As a consequence, two of the most critical sectors of the U.S. economy—communications and energy—could easily fall prey to a well-organized terrorist plot or a foreign attack. Fortunately, Washington still has time to correct course.

WHAT LIES BENEATH

British engineers laid the first submarine telegraph line across the English Channel in 1850. Eight years later, an effort backed by the American financier Cyrus Field bridged the Atlantic, linking Ireland to Newfoundland with a telegraph wire that eventually transmitted almost seven words per minute. After Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876, the first underwater telephone cable soon followed, carrying conversations beneath the San Francisco Bay.

Although the number of cables proliferated, their speed and capacity stagnated until the introduction of two key advances during the 1920s and 1930s: coaxial copper cores and polyethylene insulation, which allowed individual cables to carry multiple voice channels and provided improved durability. In subsequent decades, capacity soared, rising from 36 voice channels per cable in the 1950s to around 4,000 in the 1970s. Nevertheless, installation and maintenance costs remained high, making satellites decidedly more attractive for carrying telephone traffic. Until the 1980s, satellites could provide almost ten times as much capacity as submarine cables while requiring only one-tenth as large an investment.

But then fiber-optic technology revolutionized global communications. In 1988, a consortium of British, French, and U.S. telecommunications firms laid the first fiber-optic cable across the Atlantic. TAT-8, as the line was called, could carry 40,000 telephone calls simultaneously—an order of magnitude greater than most existing coaxial cables could handle and at a fraction of the previous cost. Today’s fiber-optic cables can transmit an amount of data equivalent to the entire printed collection of the Library of Congress in about 20 seconds.

As a result, companies, governments, and individuals can send and receive more data than ever before. In 1993, Internet users transmitted around 100 terabits of data in a year; today, they send about 150 terabits every second. And this number is expected to exceed 1,000 terabits by 2020, fueled in large part by the expansion of cellular networks in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.

Nearly all that data will travel along the seabed. Imagine, then, how damaging a determined attack on undersea infrastructure could be. One need only consider the destruction possible from natural causes and inadvertent interference. In 2006, an undersea earthquake near Taiwan snapped nine cables. It took 11 ships 49 days to finish repairs, while China, Japan, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam lost critical communication links, disrupting regional banking, markets, and trade. In 2007, Vietnamese fishermen seeking to salvage copper from a defunct coaxial cable pulled up active lines instead, disrupting Vietnam’s communications with Hong Kong and Thailand for nearly three months and requiring repairs that cost millions. Given the scarcity of equipment and personnel, it could take months, if not years, for the United States to recover from a large-scale, coordinated assault. Attackers wouldn’t even need to target U.S. assets, since U.S. traffic flows through more than a dozen other countries that serve as major hubs for the global undersea cable network.

Much of this infrastructure allows the global economy to function. Every day, SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, transmits some 20 million messages to more than 8,000 banking organizations, security institutions, and corporate customers in nearly 200 countries, reconciling trillions of dollars’ worth of assets across global financial markets. Intercontinental Exchange, which operates a global network of currency exchanges and clearing-houses, typically processes over ten million contracts each day, covering the energy, commodity, financial, and equity derivatives markets. Without the undersea fiber-optic network, this type of electronic banking and commerce simply could not happen. And in the event that the cable system shut down, millions of transactions would be cut short.

Thanks to a number of factors, moreover, a major attack turns out to be surprisingly feasible. For one, fiber-optic cables, which are typically one to two inches thick, generally follow routes that avoid high-traffic shipping lanes, fishing areas, and sensitive environmental locations. Although that helps minimize the risk of accidental damage, it means that cables tend to land at only about two dozen major sites around the world. Of the roughly 40 major submarine cables that connect the United States to the world’s global undersea communications network, nearly all make landfall at narrow stretches of coast in California, Florida, New Jersey, New York, and Oregon. On the East Coast, nearly every transatlantic cable comes ashore within only tens of miles of one another in the New York–New Jersey area.

To make matters worse, maps of many cable routes are easily accessible to the public. Every year, operators report around 100 to 150 cases of major damage, roughly 70 percent of which are the result of human activities such as fishing and anchoring. That’s why submarine cable locations appear on nautical charts. Some cables even have acoustic beacons to make them easier to find. Information about global cable routes, meanwhile, is available on the Internet, making it easy to discern a given country’s weak spots.

With detailed coordinates at their fingertips, foreign militaries could target U.S. cables using remote-controlled submarines equipped with high-resolution sonar and loaded with explosives. The barrier to entry for this type of undersea warfare is relatively low, as several different companies now sell such technology on the consumer market. In fact, thousands of undersea vehicles, operated semiautonomously or remotely, are already in service worldwide. A well-financed terrorist group could easily get its hands on one in order to target key cables and junction points. It could also opt for brute force, using fishing trawlers equipped with deep-sea grappling hooks to maul cables in shallower waters.

The global undersea cable network does have a good deal of spare capacity, enabling the swift rerouting of global communications traffic in the event of an emergency like the 2006 Taiwan earthquake. Yet a well-planned attack could take this into account, targeting multiple intercontinental submarine cables, shore-based terminals, and coastal connection points. In the attack’s aftermath, service providers would likely struggle to cooperate, scrambling to repair their own networks by hoarding skilled personnel and scarce hardware.

CRUDE AWAKENING

The first offshore oil rigs appeared in California in 1896, not long after the first undersea telephone lines were put in place. But the industry stalled for decades. In the late 1940s, drilling came to a virtual standstill owing to disputes between state and federal authorities over the power to issue leases for oil exploration. But in 1953, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower, who had campaigned on the issue, passed legislation empowering states to grant leases for activity up to three (and in some cases nine) nautical miles from the coastline and the U.S. Department of the Interior to sign off on drilling in areas beyond state jurisdiction.","The article 'Under the Sea: The Vulnerability of the Commons' extensively discusses undersea cables, their critical role in global communications, and their vulnerabilities to both natural disasters and human activities.

Jackson School of International Studies, University of Washington","**International Reactions to U.S. Cybersecurity Policy: The BRICS undersea cable**

Internationally, Snowden’s revelation about the extent of U.S. government surveillance was met with great anger. Governments began asking questions about what could be done to avoid U.S. surveillance. The BRICS—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—had already begun thinking about the idea of a global Internet without the U.S. at its center, but Snowden’s release provided the impetus to propel the issue. One element of this was the development of a BRICS undersea cable system.

The BRICS cable was slated for completion in mid-2015; however, it has not been completed and there no longer appears to be an active discussion about its creation. The fate of the BRICS cable is a lesson in how U.S. domestic cybersecurity policy can impact international debates about the future of the global Internet. It also illustrates how difficult coordination can be among countries with similar concerns about U.S. policy, but very different orientations to information and Internet governance.

**BRICS Cable Background**

The initial announcement of the BRICS Cable was in either 2012 or early 2013, although it did not gain significant political traction or media attention until after the Edward Snowden leaks of September 2013. The BRICS Cable was meant to circumvent the U.S. and NSA spying through ports in Russia, China, Singapore, India, Mauritius, South Africa, and Brazil. The two-fibre cable was slated to cost $1.5 billion, span 34,000 kilometers in length, and feature a 12.8 Tbit/s capacity system.

Project leadership primarily came from Brazil and South Africa. While Brazil provided the political impetus for the project, South African Andrew Mthembu, executive chairman of the investment group Imphandze, became the de-facto spokesperson for the project. In spite of Mthembu’s efforts, the BRICS Cable project appears stalled in 2015.

**BRICS Politics**

The exact reasons for the stalling of the BRICS Cable are unclear but can probably be traced to outstanding financial and political issues plaguing the BRICS consortium. Additionally, the BRICS group is hindered by political division within the BRICS bloc itself. These disagreements often occur along differing lines of governance and political values. 

The absence of bloc cohesion may be the factor underlying the stalling of the BRICS cable.

From the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century, laying undersea cables to establish a telegraph communication network for the British Empire was a major geopolitical policy.  

Vast submarine telegraph cables were put in place, including one running westward from the U.K. under the Atlantic Ocean, one between the U.K. and France, and one stretching southward around Africa and eventually reaching Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean.  

In the 21st century, the undersea cables were replaced with fiber optic wires, and the network’s main role changed to distribution of digital data via the internet.  

The operating principle of the internet is that if a path for traffic in a network is not available, another path is automatically selected. This means that the predominance of a model in which a country possesses and protects undersea cables connecting two points is lost.  

Therefore, the issue has shifted completely to the geoeconomic question of governments and the private sector cooperating to consider how the cables should be laid on ocean floors for the benefits of people and society.  

Proper functioning of the internet is vital for the global community as a whole, and how to keep it going is an important matter of policy for governments.  

The internet can be described as a network of blood vessels that maintains the health of global society, and submarine cables are the arteries.  

**New undersea cables to Japan**  
A joint venture between Finnish infrastructure operator Cinia and Russian telecommunications company MegaFon finished the first stage of offshore surveys earlier this year as part of their Arctic Connect project, which aims to build a 138,000-kilometer subsea telecommunications link that connects the coastal areas of Northern Europe with Japan.  

On July 6, California-based Ram Telecom International Inc. announced the completion of the Japan-Guam-Australia cable system that links Guam and Japan with the aim of making the former a new network hub in the western Pacific.  

Guam would become a completely new hub in the region, as cables in the western Pacific are currently concentrated in the South China Sea.  

Subsea cables are crucial, with fiber optic wires carrying more than 90% of all the data currently exchanged worldwide via the internet.  

The Federal Communications Commission in the United States has estimated that only 0.37% of the country’s international data traffic is carried by satellite, indicating that almost all of the digital data on the internet is transmitted globally through submarine cables.  

Mobile telecommunications networks — including 5G — function like a capillary network, providing internet access to every corner of the world.  

Satellite communication, despite having much less bandwidth than fiber optic communication, can cover vast surface areas of the Earth since it uses a propagation path from space.  

But because stationary satellites are lined up some 36,000 km above the equator, their signals weaken significantly near the north and south poles due to atmospheric effects as their elevation angle becomes low.  

The melting of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean due to climate change is enabling undersea cables to be laid in the area, a development that is epoch-making in the sense that the project can provide high-speed communication to people living in the Arctic region for the first time.  

This year, there are some 400 undersea cables worldwide. They are laid and jointly owned by a variety of business entities, including submarine cable operators, telephone companies and providers of over-the-top video or streaming media services offered via the internet, such as Microsoft, Facebook and Google.  

The internet, which is based on an autonomous distribution system that makes it possible to route around damage by finding alternative paths if something bad happens in a network, has a high affinity with submarine cables built redundantly and spreading all over.  

The internet makes good use of such undersea cables, meaning the cables symbolize the arteries and the core of the internet, which has a mission of guaranteeing access no matter what.  

**Brand new network topology**  
According to Weathernews Inc. which conducts consistent studies of trends in Arctic sea ice using its own methods, the total area of sea ice in the region has declined by approximately 3 million square kilometers compared with two decades ago.  

In response to such climate change in the Arctic, Canadian cable builder Arctic Fibre came up with a plan in 2011 to send an expedition to the Northwest Passage to conduct offshore surveys to lay undersea fiber optics on a northbound route linking the U.K., Canada, Alaska and Japan.  

When I was consulted about the plan, I recognized that both the fear of global warming melting ice in the Arctic and the dream of a completely new network being created are both coming true simultaneously.  

At that time, all internet connections between Japan and Europe went through cables that ran underneath the Pacific Ocean, crossing the American continent and reaching the U.K. via the Atlantic Ocean.  

While cables that cross continents inherently contain security risks, submarine cables are relatively safe and free arteries.  

Calculations show that undersea cables have various advantages regarding latency as well.  

In particular, the route that branches off at the south of the Bering Sea — the gateway between the Arctic and the Pacific — and links Seattle and Hokkaido makes Japan’s northernmost prefecture the closest Japanese location to New York, making it attractive for the finance industry.  

At the end of last year, I was asked by a friend in NORDUnet — a research and education network of the five Nordic countries — to cooperate in making a new plan to link northern Europe and Japan using Cinia’s cables.  

If realized, cables will run from northern Europe through the Bering Sea, diverge to the U.S., Tokyo and Tomakomai, Hokkaido, cross the Tsugaru Strait and land in Vladivostok, Russia.  

Previously, most of the cables running across the Atlantic landed in the U.K. But following Brexit, an increasing number of projects are planned to lay cables to reach areas in the European Union, such as Marseille, France. The Nordic nations’ project is apparently in line with such trends.  

**Undersea cables and cybersecurity**  
While submarine cables are a relatively safe and free network, cables crossing continents can be affected by nations’ policies.  

The latest cables will provide a completely new artery in the north for telecommunications connecting the EU to Japan and Asia, which are currently dependent on cables crossing over the American continent or Russia.  

Submarine cables are made up of optic fibers, protective covers and electrical cables that transmit electricity to amplifiers to boost weakened signals. The protective covers give security against being bitten through by sharks, for example.  

Compared to electrical signals used in the past, fiber optic communications are much more difficult to tap, which means there is less of a security risk of undersea cables being compromised.  

On the other hand, because undersea cables’ signals and electric power transmissions fluctuate due to external factors, close measurements of such fluctuations are sometimes used as seabed sensors to detect fish and submarines.  

Undersea cables are also actively used as sensors to measure sea floor movements, especially earthquakes and undersea volcanoes.  

The most dangerous risk for such cables is for them to be cut, which can occur as a result of trawling, the raising or dragging of anchors, undersea construction, sand dredging, earthquakes and undersea landslides.  

In order to safeguard against such man-made and natural hazards, the laying of undersea cables is managed by the International Cable Protection Committee, which covers 97% of the cables in the world’s oceans.  

**Linking Japan and Asia**  
Most of the cables connecting Japan and other Asian countries are concentrated in the sea south of Taiwan, and statistics show that undersea cable failures occurred in this area once a week on average since 2005.  

Such cases are rising every year, indicating that failures in submarine cable systems are increasingly caused by factors other than natural disasters such as earthquakes.  

Considering that communication cables linking the U.S. and Asia have been running from the Pacific Ocean through parts of Japan, such as Ibaraki, Chiba and Mie prefectures, most of the telecommunications between North America and southeast Asia must have been disrupted by the cable failures in this area.  

This has prompted the development of a new cable topology in the Pacific, setting Guam as a hub, starting with a plan by academic networks for research and education comprising members from the United States.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, mentioning their importance to global internet connectivity and detailing the risks associated with them, including the potential for being cut.

A little over 350 of them, in fact, are lying at the bottom of the ocean.

Submarine cables stretch across the world, managing almost all the internet’s traffic between them. That’s everything from financial settlement systems through to voice and video calls.

Content distribution networks help to take the load off both systems by situating oft-repeated content closer to its audience, but it must still get to those staging points in the first place.

Typically, when a submarine cable goes down the causes are mundane. A ship dragging its anchor along the seabed was reportedly responsible for cutting direct connections between the UK mainland and the Channel Islands in late November, for example. As a result, telecoms firm JT had to route all traffic to and from the Channel Islands via an alternative link with France.

When human ineptitude isn’t to blame for submarine cable outages, it’s most often nature – earthquakes, cyclones and the like – that take over. But what about intentional human intervention?

We have seen signs of attacks in the past, such as the incident in Egypt in 2013, when three divers were caught attempting to cut undersea cables (although they later said it was a mistake).

Analysts tell us that simple redundancy will protect us, and as the Channel Islands incident showed, there are typically multiple points of redundancy in undersea fibre-optic networks.

These levels of redundancy vary around the world, though, with historically proven single points of failure at several locations along the top of Africa and in south-east Asia.

Even in countries with more developed connections, targeting multiple ingress and egress points could create significant service disruptions.

We have seen what appear to be malicious attacks on cables before. In 2008, the cables connecting Sicily to Egypt were cut, reportedly choking off traffic between Europe and Asia.

Submarine cables are unprotected in deep waters, simply lying on the seafloor. Closer to the coastline, they are often protected by a galvanized coating and shallowly buried.

Then they come ashore, often connecting to terrestrial fibre underneath access covers next to the beach or in small, anonymous-looking concrete buildings.

All these points are potentially vulnerable to different kinds of physical attack.

Experts point out that submarine cables can always be repaired. The question is, how long would this take? It took around two weeks to get the three severed Channel Islands cables back up and running – though this was partly because the ship originally assigned to the job was called away to another.

There are only so many vessels able to perform this highly specialized job, and they’ve been known to face attacks of their own. What would happen if the global fleet were taxed too heavily?

While it may sound like the plot of a Bond movie, the reality is, such attacks are enough of a threat that the Pentagon is taking notice. Recent reports suggest that the US is getting particularly worried about Russian submarine and spy ship activities around undersea cable routes.

Companies such as Microsoft and Google are building out their own submarine fibre, probably more for cost reasons than for resiliency.

On land, and over short stretches of water such as the English Channel, microwave is also proving a lower-latency option than fibre for companies particularly worried about that kind of thing.

Neither hyperscale-owned fibre or bank-commissioned microwave may be predicated on resiliency but it’s certainly a side benefit. For those companies not rich enough to build out their own private internet backbone, however, a little planning might be necessary to ensure that traffic is channelled along several redundant routes.

While corporate providers mull these options, consumers will just have to cross their fingers and hope for the best when they settle down to a video call with Grandma half a world away.","The article discusses submarine cables extensively, including direct mentions of incidents where cables were cut, such as the Channel Islands incident and the 2008 incident affecting traffic between Europe and Asia.

The fear is that the Russians might sever the fiber-optic cables at a strategic time to greatly inhibit worldwide Internet connectivity. “It would be the biggest disruption to your internet service since your upstairs neighbor put a password on his WiFi,” Colbert said. Other non–nation state threats to the cables include natural disasters and sharks.  

The host talked about the return of Cold War–era anxieties, something the _New York Times_ also raised when it noted last week that “the issue goes beyond old worries during the Cold War that the Russians would tap into the cables.”

But Colbert also used the news story as an opportunity to teach people about the infrastructure of the Internet. “First of all—what is the Internet doing underwater?” he joked. “Last time I checked I’m not supposed to get my computer wet. … What happened to the cloud? I was told there was a cloud.” It may sound silly, but it’s not unimportant to remind people that the Internet isn’t quite the omnipresent spirit entity it appears to be. Connectivity exists because of very real physical infrastructure.

So to prepare for a possible digital blackout, Colbert packed an “Internet Outage Go-Bag,” which included a photo of a baby, printouts of local restaurant recommendations and movie times, and a thick stack of racist tweets. Plus, “To replace YouTube you, of course, are going to want to get a cat. Preferably one dressed in a tuxedo.”

You panic when even a few drops of water fall on your laptop. Everyone knows that water and electronics don’t “mix.” That’s why it seems so ironic that most of the Internet’s “hard” infrastructure lies underwater on the ocean floor.

Virtually all global data travels through millions of miles of submarine fiber optic cables beneath the ocean’s surface. More than 350 subsea cable lines stretch from the U.S. West Coast to the East Coast, with many more being deployed to connect countries around the world.

Installing submarine fiber optic cables deep on the ocean floor is time-consuming and expensive. While special ships deploy the cable, ocean divers repair and maintain the network. And even with thick, protective jackets, there are many ways to damage a cable. Some destructive forces include ship anchors, commercial fishing equipment, earthquakes, hurricanes, and even sinister interference.

**HOW UNDERSEA CABLES ARE LAID**

Laying undersea cables requires the combined efforts of explorers, navigators, and engineers. Explorers must understand the ocean floor to identify the best route for laying the cable. They use sonar technology to map out the terrain and locate any potential obstacles that may impede the cable’s progress. Navigators are responsible for ensuring that the cable is laid in a straight line and that it follows the planned route. Engineers must design and build the cable, as well as ensure its integrity during installation.

Once the cable is laid, it must be tested for performance and reliability. This is done by sending a signal through the cable and measuring its speed and accuracy. If any problems are detected, they must be addressed before the cable can be put into service.

**I SPY WITH MY LITTLE EYE**

For years, NATO forces and our military have spotted Russian submarines and ships lurking around near the sites of key intercontinental cables. The U.S. and our allies worry about Russia’s interest in these submarine fiber optic cables that carry most of the world’s data, e-mails, and texts. Just as troubling, these cables transmit $10 trillion in financial transactions each day. Is Russia interested in cutting or tapping the cables? Does it want us to worry that it might? Or is there a more innocent explanation? Whatever it might be, Russia isn’t talking.

Enemies have threatened undersea cables before. During World War II and the Cold War, our foes targeted Allied copper underwater cables and wires. More recently, British and American intelligence agencies eavesdropped on submarine fiber optic cables, according to documents released by Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor.

**TAKING A JUMP FORWARD**

Until recently, service providers banded together to install and maintain underwater cable networks. In this arrangement, each provider owns part of the data transmitted through the cables.

However, tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Microsoft are now deploying their own subsea cable networks for exclusively private use. Virtually anyone can easily identify these network locations on public maps. Cutting one cable might have a limited impact. However, damaging several at the same time or at choke points could create a major outage.

Not to change subjects, but this might be a good time to backup your inbox on a hard drive in a very dry place. Like most types of infrastructure, we only notice when it breaks.

**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**

How thick are undersea cables?
* Modern submarine fiber optic cables are typically between 0.8 and 1.2 inches thick. They are made up of multiple layers of protective material, such as Kevlar, around a single glass fiber core. The outermost layer is usually a polyethylene coating to protect the cable from the environment.

Do the cables really rest on the ocean floor’s surface?
* Yes, cables extend all the way down. Cables are buried under the seabed near the shore for protection, which explains why you don’t see them when you go to the beach.

How many kilometers of cable are there?
* We estimate that nearly 1.4 million kilometers of submarine cables will be in service by early 2023.","The article discusses submarine fiber optic cables and the potential threats they face, including cutting by adversaries.

Submarine cables are the backbone of the Internet and many other communication networks, connecting countries and continents around the world. As we rely increasingly on digital communication for business, financial and personal needs, the submarine cable network has become the backbone of the global economy. Thus, their vulnerability is the vulnerability of modern society. Seabed cables can be vulnerable to damage caused by natural disasters or malicious actors. In this blog post, we will dive deep into understanding the physical, electronic, and legal protection of seabed cables.

### What are submarine cables?  
Seabed cables transmit data, voice, and video information between countries or continents by using fibre-optic technology. More than 1 million kilometres of submarine cables crisscross oceans and seas.  
Technologically speaking, seabed cables contain fibre of glass that permit the transmission of light signals over great distances. Light signals carry digital data from email and blogs to YouTube and Netflix, to name a few.

### What is the history of seabed cables?  
Seabed cables aren’t new. The first cables connected Britain and France in the 1850s. A few decades later, the first trans-Atlantic cable connected Great Britain and the United States. Since then, seabed cables have grown in number and complexity.

### Why are seabed cables important for the internet?  
Without seabed cables, the internet we know won’t exist. They carry internet traffic from email to YouTube videos. You are reading these lines from data that is transmitted via one of the seabed cables. These cables carry billions of bits of data transmitted across continents in milliseconds. All in all, seabed cables represent an important part of the architecture that makes our digital lives possible today.

### Can satellites replace submarine cables as the main communication infrastructure?  
Not yet. Seabed cables carry most of the global traffic. While satellite technology, such as SpaceX, can provide efficient local access, it is not yet a solution for data traffic across oceans and long distances. Nevertheless, advances in satellite technology may change it. For example, laser transmission between satellites can provide high bandwidth and fast speed comparable to seabed cables.

### How are seabed cables protected?  
Protection of submarine cables involves physical, electronic, and legal measures.

#### Physical protection of seabed cables  
Most seabed cables are buried between 1-2 meters below the seabed. This creates an extra layer of physical protection for seabed cables from trawlers and anchors, which may cause physical damage to seabed cables. This protection is achieved by seabed dredging and cable burial in trenches. Cables are also protected by armour, a protective shield that prevents them from being damaged by marine life and underwater hazards. Cable armour is made from heavy-duty materials like steel and armoured polyethene, which provides the extra layer of protection seabed cables require to survive in the deep ocean environment.

#### Electronic protection of seabed cables  
Electronic monitoring systems protect seabed cables from damage and destruction. These systems detect any changes or anomalies in the seabed environment and alert operators if there is potential for harm to seabed cables. Data transmitted via seabed cables are protected electronically with an end-to-end encryption system. This reduces the risk of tapping into the seabed cables and spying on the transmitted data.

#### Legal protection of seabed cables  
Within territorial waters, seabed cables are protected by national regulations. At the open sea, seabed cables are protected by the provisions of the Law of the Sea Convention (LOS). Firstly, LOS sets the rules for the construction and maintenance of seabed cables. Secondly, it limits activities such as fishing or anchoring that could damage the cable somehow. Finally, the LOS specifies which country has jurisdiction over seabed cables.

### How can we reduce the risks for the internet from seabed cable disruption?  
Despite all measures to protect submarine cables, the risks remain. However, some of the following activities could reduce these risks for the normal functioning of the internet.

#### Diversification via more submarine cables  
The more internet cables we have, the less risk there will be. Adding more seabed cables will give us failover options in case of disruption. Internet traffic can be redirected from damaged seabed cables to alternative ones.

#### Better satellite communication  
Advancements in satellite technology could provide another channel for internet traffic. The internet infrastructure could be more stable if there were more satellite constellations with more bandwidth and speed.

#### Internet exchange points  
Internet exchange points (IXPs) connect a few networks at the country and community levels. In this way, they keep traffic local without using international internet cables.

### Conclusion  
Seabed cables are a crucial part of our digital infrastructure and must be protected physically, electronically and legally. Physical protection is achieved by seabed dredging and cable burial in trenches. Electronic monitoring systems pick up on any changes or oddities in the environment of the seabed and let operators know if there are risks of cable disruption. Data transmitted via seabed cables are protected electronically with an end-to-end encryption system. Finally, seabed cables are protected by the provisions of the Law of the Sea Convention (LOS) and national laws.  
The risks for overall internet from cable disruptions can also be reduced by having more cables, advancements in satellite technology, and the development of internet exchange points.  
Together, these measures reduce risks for seabed cables. However, given their high importance for modern society, seabed cables must be made even more robust, in particular, via international legal protection.","The article discusses submarine cables extensively, addressing their importance, vulnerabilities, and the protective measures needed to ensure their integrity.

Submarine cables are vital to the global economy and the national security of States. While their importance and role in transmitting most of the world's data and communications is increasingly being recognised by States, the legal regime governing submarine cables is often characterised as a neglected area of the law of the sea. The security implications arising from an intentional attack on international submarine cables cannot be underestimated. Despite the significant security risks and vulnerabilities, the legal regime governing submarine cables is limited and there are a number of crucial gaps in the regulation of submarine cables. This article examines the existing legal options available to States to close the ‘security gap’ using the Australian experience as a case study. A number of respected commentators in this area have argued that the best way to close the security gap in the regulation of submarine cables would be to develop a new counter–terrorism convention to criminalise the intentional damage of international submarine cables. This article reflects on whether additional legal options are necessary or available to effectively close these gaps given the institutional, legal and political context surrounding the ‘orphan’ of international law: submarine cables.","The article discusses 'submarine cables' extensively, focusing on their legal and security implications, particularly regarding intentional damage.

Russia’s Christmas present to Britain? Sending a warship incredibly close to UK territorial waters. On Dec. 23, the Royal Navy frigate _HMS St Albans_ was called upon to “keep watch” on and escort a new Russian warship “through the North Sea and areas of UK interest,” the Royal Navy confirmed.

It’s not the first time, either. The Royal Navy noted that “the festive season has seen an upsurge in Russian units transiting UK waters.” On Christmas Eve, the _HMS Tyne_ was called to escort a different vessel, a Russian intelligence-gathering ship, through the North Sea and English Channel.

“I will not hesitate in defending our waters or tolerate any form of aggression,” UK defence secretary Gavin Williamson said in a statement this week. “Britain will never be intimidated when it comes to protecting our country, our people, and our national interests.”

**Russia’s growing presence near UK waters**

Over the past few years, Russian sea units have popped up all over the borders of Britain’s territorial waters.

In January, three RAF Typhoon fighter jets and a British warship escorted a Russian aircraft carrier and other ships up the English Channel. In June 2016, the Royal Navy intercepted a Russian Kilo-class submarine, capable of carrying cruise missiles and torpedoes, after detecting it in the North Sea.

Earlier this month, Britain’s most senior military officer also warned that Russia is posing a threat to undersea communications and internet cables. Air chief marshal Stuart Peach said any disruption to such communications would “immediately and potentially catastrophically” hurt the economy.

Russia could do damage even without its most advanced warships and submarines: According to a recent report by think tank Policy Exchange, fishing trawlers with deep-sea grappling hooks could be used to carry out an attack on undersea cables and communications. ”Whether from terrorist activity or an increasingly bellicose Russian naval presence,” the report said, “the threat of these vulnerabilities being exploited is growing.

A submarine cable system coming ashore in Fiji.

Recently, a [_New York Times_ article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/world/europe/russian-presence-near-undersea-cables-concerns-us.html) on Russian submarine activity near undersea communications cables dredged up Cold War politics and generated widespread recognition of the submerged systems we all depend upon.

Not many people realise that undersea cables transport nearly [100% of transoceanic data traffic](https://books.google.com/books?id=LQDXAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA362&dq=submarine+telecommunications+cables&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBGoVChMI5Pm8_oPyyAIVBG4-Ch379Al9#v=onepage&q=99&f=false). These lines are laid on the very bottom of the ocean floor. They’re about as thick as a garden hose and carry the world’s Internet, phone calls and even television transmissions between continents at the speed of light. A single cable can carry tens of terabits of information per second.

While researching my book [_The Undersea Network_](https://www.dukeupress.edu/The-Undersea-Network), I realised that the cables we all rely on to send everything from e-mail to banking information across the seas remain largely unregulated and undefended. Although they are laid by only a few companies (including the American company SubCom and the French company Alcatel-Lucent) and often funnelled along narrow paths, the ocean’s vastness has often provided them protection.

The fact that we route Internet traffic through the ocean — amid deep-sea creatures and hydrothermal vents — runs counter to most people’s imaginings of the Internet. Didn’t we develop satellites and Wi-Fi to transmit signals through the air? Haven’t we moved to the cloud? Undersea cable systems sound like a thing of the past.

The reality is that the cloud is actually under the ocean. Even though they might seem behind the times, fibre-optic cables are actually state-of-the-art global communications technologies. Since they use light to encode information and remain unfettered by weather, cables carry data faster and cheaper than satellites. They crisscross the continents too — a message from New York to California also travels by fibre-optic cable. These systems are not going to be replaced by aerial communications anytime soon.

The biggest problem with cable systems is not technological — it’s human. Because they run underground, underwater and between telephone poles, cable systems populate the same spaces we do. As a result, we accidentally break them all the time. Local construction projects dig up terrestrial lines. Boaters drop anchors on cables. And submarines can pinpoint systems under the sea.

Most of the recent media coverage has been dominated by the question of vulnerability. Are global communications networks really at risk of disruption? What would happen if these cables were cut? Do we need to worry about the threat of sabotage from Russian subs or terrorist agents?

The answer to this is not black and white. Any individual cable is always at risk, but likely far more so from boaters and fishermen than any saboteur. Over history, the single largest cause of disruption has been people [unintentionally dropping anchors and nets](https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid=1&doctype=cite&docid=35+Tul.+Mar.+L.+J.+103&srctype=smi&srcid=3B15&key=643357ed57ae3d616915cb7b77c245f4). The [International Cable Protection Committee](https://www.iscpc.org) has been working for years to prevent such breaks.

As a result, cables today are covered in steel armour and buried beneath the seafloor at their shore-ends, where the human threat is most concentrated. This provides some level of protection. In the deep sea, the ocean’s inaccessibility largely safeguards cables — they need only to be covered with a thin polyethylene sheath. It’s not that it’s much more difficult to sever cables in the deep ocean, it’s just that the primary forms of interference are less likely to happen. The sea is so big and the cables are so narrow, the probability isn’t that high that you’d run across one.

Sabotage has actually been rare in the history of undersea cables. There are certainly occurrences (though none recently), but these are disproportionately publicised. The World War 1 [German raid of the Fanning Island cable station in the Pacific Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanning_Raid) gets a lot of attention. And there was [speculation about sabotage](http://www.economist.com/node/10653963) in the cable disruptions outside Alexandria, Egypt in 2008, which cut 70% of the country’s Internet, affecting millions. Yet we hear little about the regular faults that occur, on average, [about 200 times each year](https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid=1&doctype=cite&docid=35+Tul.+Mar.+L.+J.+103&srctype=smi&srcid=3B15&key=643357ed57ae3d616915cb7b77c245f4).

**Redundancy provides some protection**  
The fact is it’s incredibly difficult to monitor these lines. Cable companies have been trying to do so for more than a century, since the first telegraph lines were laid in the 1800s. But the ocean is too vast and the lines simply too long. It would be impossible to stop every vessel that came anywhere near critical communications cables. We’d need to create extremely long, “no-go” zones across the ocean, which itself would profoundly disrupt the economy.

[Fewer than 300 cable systems](http://submarinecablemap.com) transport almost all transoceanic traffic around the world. And these often run through narrow pressure points where small disruptions can have massive impacts. Since each cable can carry an extraordinary amount of information, it’s not uncommon for an entire country to rely on only a handful of systems. In many places, it would take only a few cable cuts to take out large swathes of the Internet. If the right cables were disrupted at the right time, it could disrupt global Internet traffic for weeks or even months.

The thing that protects global information traffic is the fact that there’s some redundancy built into the system. Since there is more cable capacity than there is traffic, when there is a break, information is automatically rerouted along other cables. Because there are many systems linking to the US, and a lot of Internet infrastructure is located here, a single cable outage is unlikely to cause any noticeable effect for Americans.

Any single cable line has been and will continue to be susceptible to disruption. And the only way around this is to build a more diverse system. But as things are, even though individual companies each look out for their own network, there is no economic incentive or supervisory body to ensure the global system as a whole is resilient. If there’s a vulnerability to worry about, this is it.

The apparent Russian focus on the cables, which provide Internet and other communications connections to North America and Europe, could give the Kremlin the power to sever or tap into vital data lines, the officials said. Russian submarine activity has increased to levels unseen since the Cold War, they said, sparking hunts in recent months for the elusive watercraft.

“We are now seeing Russian underwater activity in the vicinity of undersea cables that I don’t believe we have ever seen,” said U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Andrew Lennon, the commander of NATO’s submarine forces. “Russia is clearly taking an interest in NATO and NATO nations’ undersea infrastructure.”

NATO has responded with plans to reestablish a command post shuttered after the Cold War to help secure the North Atlantic. NATO allies are also rushing to boost anti-submarine warfare capabilities and to develop advanced submarine-detecting planes.

Britain’s top military commander also warned that Russia could imperil the cables that form the backbone of the modern global economy. The privately owned lines, laid along the same corridors as the first transatlantic telegraph wire in 1858, carry nearly all of the communications on the Internet, facilitating trillions of dollars of daily trade. If severed, they could snarl the Web. If tapped, they could give Russia a valuable picture of the tide of the world’s Internet traffic.

“It’s a pattern of activity, and it’s a vulnerability,” said British Air Chief Marshal Stuart Peach, in an interview.

“Can you imagine a scenario where those cables are cut or disrupted, which would immediately and potentially catastrophically affect both our economy and other ways of living if they were disrupted?” Peach said in a speech in London this month.

The Russian Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment about the cables.

The Russian sea activity comes as the Kremlin has also pressed against NATO in the air and on land. Russian jets routinely clip NATO airspace in the Baltics, and troops drilled near NATO territory in September.

Russia has moved to modernize its once-decrepit Soviet-era fleet of submarines, bringing online or overhauling 13 craft since 2014. That pace, coming after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula set off a new era of confrontation with the West, has spurred NATO efforts to counter them. Russia has about 60 full-size submarines, while the United States has 66.

Among Russia’s capabilities, Lennon said, are deep-sea research vessels, including an old converted ballistic submarine that carries smaller submarines.

“They can do oceanographic research, underwater intelligence gathering,” he said. “And what we have observed is an increased activity of that in the vicinity of undersea cables. We know that these auxiliary submarines are designed to work on the ocean floor, and they’re transported by the mother ship, and we believe they may be equipped to manipulate objects on the ocean floor.”

That capability could give Russia the ability to sever the cables or tap into them. The insulated fiber-optic cables are fragile, and ships have damaged them accidentally by dragging their anchors along the seabed. That damage happens near the shore, where it is relatively easy to fix, not in the deeper Atlantic, where the cost of mischief could be far greater.

Lennon declined to say whether NATO believes Russia has actually touched the cables. Russian military leaders have acknowledged that the Kremlin is active undersea at levels not seen since the end of the Cold War, when Russia was forced to curtail its submarine program in the face of economic turmoil and disorganization.

“Last year we reached the same level as before the post-Soviet period, in terms of running hours,” said Adm. Vladimir Korolev, the commander of the Russian Navy, earlier this year. “This is more than 3,000 days at sea for the Russian submarine fleet. This is an excellent sign.”

The activity has forced a revival of Western sub-hunting skills that lay largely dormant since the end of the Cold War. Lennon said NATO allies have long practiced submarine-hunting. But until the last few years, there were few practical needs for close tracking, military officials said.

In recent months, the U.S. Navy has flown sorties in the areas where Russia is known to operate its submarines, according to aircraft trackers that use publicly available transponder data. On Thursday, for example, one of the planes shot off from Naval Air Station Sigonella in Sicily, headed eastward into the Mediterranean. It flew the same mission a day earlier.

The trackers have captured at least 10 missions carried out by U.S. submarine-tracking planes this month, excluding trips when the planes simply appeared to be in transit from one base to another. November was even busier, with at least 17 missions captured by the trackers.

NATO does not comment on specific submarine-tracking flights and declined to release data, citing the classified nature of the missions. But NATO officials say that their submarine-tracking activities have significantly increased in the region.

Submarines are particularly potent war-fighting craft because they can generally only be heard, not seen, underwater. They can serve as a retaliatory strike force in case of nuclear war, threaten military resupply efforts and expand the range of conventional firepower available for use in lower-level conflicts.

The vessels are a good fit for the Kremlin's strategy of making do with less than its rivals, analysts say: Russia's foes need vast resources to track a single undersea craft, making the submarines' cost-to-mischief ratio attractive. Even as Russia remains a vastly weaker military force than NATO, the Kremlin has been able to pack an outsize punch in its confrontation with the West through the seizure of Crimea, support for the Syrian regime and, according to U.S. intelligence, its attempts to influence the U.S. election.

“You go off and you try to add expense for anything that we’re doing, or you put things at risk that are of value to us, and submarines give them the capability to do it,” a senior NATO official said of the Russian approach, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence assessments.

Russian military planners can say, “I can build fewer of them, I can have better quality, and I can put at risk and challenge and make it difficult for NATO,” the official said.

Still, some analysts say the threat to cables may be overblown.

“Arguably, the Russians wouldn’t be doing their jobs if they couldn’t threaten underwater cables. Certainly, NATO allies would not be doing theirs if they were unable to counter that,” said Adam Thomson, a former British ambassador to NATO.

Russian military planners have publicized their repeated use of submarine-launched Kalibr cruise missiles during their incursion into Syria, which began in fall 2015. (In Syria, the missiles have not always hit their targets, according to U.S. intelligence officials, undermining somewhat the Russian claims of potency.)

NATO’s hunts — which have stretched across the Baltic, Mediterranean and Atlantic — have mobilized submarine-tracking frigates, sonar-equipped P8 Poseidon planes and helicopters, and attack submarines that have combed the seas.

“The Russians are operating all over the Atlantic,” said NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. “They are also operating closer to our shores.”

Russia’s enhanced submarine powers give urgency to NATO’s new efforts to ensure that it can get forces to the battlefront if there is a conflict, Stoltenberg said. In addition to the new Atlantic-focused command, the alliance also plans to create another command dedicated to enabling military forces to travel quickly across Europe.

NATO defense ministers approved the creation of the commands at a November meeting. Further details are expected in February. The plans are still being negotiated, but they currently include the North Atlantic command being embedded inside the U.S. Fleet Forces Command in Norfolk, which would transform into a broader NATO joint force command if there was a conflict, a NATO diplomat said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss plans that have not been finalized.

“Credible deterrence is linked to credible reinforcement capabilities,” Stoltenberg said. “We’re a transatlantic alliance. You need to be able to cross the Atlantic.”

But with an aging submarine fleet and growing threats from North Korea and elsewhere, the Navy risks overstretching its submarine fleet in the Atlantic and Pacific theaters.  
Russian President Vladimir Putin is increasingly challenging U.S. security interests, and his submarine fleet’s operational tempo is reaching Cold War-era levels.

Information technology is the contemporary currency of power and the global network of over 420 submarine cables spanning some 700,000 miles is the information superhighway used for sharing 97 percent of international communications. During armed conflict, belligerents could degrade, damage, or sever submarine cables, or use them to launch cyberattacks against their enemy. These activities invariably will affect the economic and military communications of neutral states.

This article first explores the peacetime law governing submarine cables. All states have the right to lay submarine cables on the high seas, as well as in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and continental shelves of coastal states. Next, the article focuses on the traditional maritime law of neutrality. This body of law applies during armed conflict and protects the rights of neutral states not party to the conflict, including the inviolability of submarine cables in their waters from physical attack by belligerents.

Neutral states are those that have elected not to take part in an armed conflict and instead seek to maintain friendly, impartial relations with all states. The law of neutrality regulates the relationship between states that are party to a conflict and those that are not engaged in armed conflict. Neutral states strive to balance the right of belligerents to prosecute the war effort and the right of neutral states to be free from the adverse effects of armed conflicts.

Belligerent states are forbidden from using neutral waters as a base of naval operations against the enemy. This proscription includes using neutral waters to refuel, resupply, repair, or rearm warships. Belligerent warships may not remain in neutral waters longer than twenty-four hours.

Submarine cables that lie on the continental shelf in the internal waters, archipelagic waters, or territorial sea of a coastal state are under the sovereignty of the coastal state and are physically inviolable during armed conflict. During the Spanish-American war, the United States set the precedent for the belligerent right to cut neutral cables serving the enemy that lie outside neutral waters. The complexities of the law of neutrality and submarine cables make analysis challenging.","The article 'The Law of Maritime Neutrality and Submarine Cables' discusses submarine cables extensively, including their potential damage or severing during armed conflicts.

Wires inside tubes no bigger than a garden hose.**  
With cell phone, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth almost everywhere, it sometimes seems like we’ve finally ditched the cumbersome cords that are tethering us and our gadgets to Earth. But in reality, we live in a world that’s more wired than ever before — it's just that those wires are strung along the bottom of the world’s oceans.

“Ninety-nine percent of trans-oceanic data traffic, Internet traffic, goes underneath the ocean on the very bottom of the sea floor,” says Nicole Starosielski, an assistant professor of media, culture and communication at New York University. She’s the author of ""The Undersea Network,"" a book exploring this hidden world of cable.

The scale of the network is both superhuman and surprisingly mundane at the same time. The wires are strung along the ocean bed by large tankers, which carry enough cable to go across the entire Atlantic Ocean. But the cables themselves aren't that big.

“It’s about the size of a garden hose,” Starosielski says. “In Guam, for example, the cables run right over the shoreline. … People step over them looking for the tourist attraction down the beach … and have no idea the Internet is pulsing right underneath their feet.”

And that's why the biggest threat to these cables is humans, not sharks or other sea life. “The majority of the disruptions of our undersea network come from people dropping an anchor off their boat and hitting the cable, or a fisherman dragging a net on the bottom of the sea floor,” Starosielski explains — not exactly the usual cause that comes to mind when Google fails to reload.

The cables seemingly haven’t been targets for terrorists thus far. “Some in the industry speculate that is because they’re not a visible target,” says Starosielski, but it also could be due to a lack of reporting. She notes one incident off the coast of Egypt in 2008 when multiple cables broke in succession.

“This looked very suspicious,” she says. Though reports indicated the damage was due to ships dropping anchors in the area, videos didn’t show any vessels in the area at the right time. The resulting outage was huge, disconnecting approximately 60 million people in India, 12 million in Pakistan, six million in Egypt and almost five million in Saudi Arabia.

“There are certainly people who are worrying about the fact that our cable network isn’t totally diverse, and there are these critical single points of failure,” Starosielski says.

The Arctic Fibre Project, which is exploring laying fiber-optic cables in the Arctic Ocean, would help combat the lack of diversity. “We’ve never had a cable that has gone through the Arctic Ocean,"" Starosielski says. The cables would link Japan to the United Kingdom could zap data from one end to the other in just 154 milliseconds.

But terrorism or human error aside, the cables were built to last. They can withstand the inhospitable ocean floor for 25 years, and, as Starosielski notes, “what else of the Internet has been instituted and stayed the same for 25 years?""  

_This story is based on an interview from PRI's Science Friday with Ira Flatow._","The article titled ""What links the global Internet? Wires inside tubes no bigger than a garden hose"" discusses the critical role of undersea cables in global internet connectivity.

It mentions that the majority of disruptions to these cables are caused by human activities, rather than natural events.

It's sometimes easy to forget that the information superhighway travels mostly in huge cables buried deep at sea—miles and miles of fiber optic wire that carry on them 95% of our daily communication and $10 trillion worth of global business. If someone were to sever enough of said cables, our tenuous grasp on the modern world would be lost. Electronic banking would be a distant memory, your smartphone would be just a phone, and life would be hell.  

These fears have been stoked recently by Russian naval activities. According to a story in the New York Times, Russian spy planes and submarines are ""aggressively operating near the vital undersea cables that carry almost all global Internet communications."" American intelligence officials are reportedly worried that this activity could mean the Ruskies are scouting vulnerabilities.  

So, how likely is it that Russia would cut these cables? We asked Nicole Starosielski, Assistant professor at NYU and author of the book *The Undersea Network*.  

**How petrified should we be?**  
**Nicole Starosielski:** I don't think we should be totally petrified. Our network is concentrated along narrow cable routes, which are regularly disrupted by natural disasters more than deliberate cable cutting.  

**What would it take to cut cables?**  
It wouldn't take much. Cables can be severed just as easily as shallow water cables, using an anchor or large, sharp device dragged along the seafloor.  

**What happens if cables are severed?**  
This depends on how many cables are cut. Cable breaks are routine, and traffic can often be redirected. However, if a country has only a few cables, a single break could be disastrous.  

**What does cutting these cables mean financially?**  
Stephen Malphrus from the US Federal Reserve said if the cable networks are disrupted, it would affect many everyday financial transactions. ATM cards would stop working.  

**How does the US monitor activity near these cables?**  
Cables aren't monitored. Cable companies have tried various tactics to monitor them but have been unsuccessful in preventing disruptions.  

**Wouldn't cutting cables disrupt Russia's communications too?**  
Yes, cutting cables would also disrupt their networks. It would be indiscriminate and affect many countries.  

**Why are undersea cables still used?**  
Undersea cables are one of the oldest global communications technologies. They carry data traffic faster and cheaper than satellites.  

**Why aren't cable locations kept classified?**  
The biggest threats are from boats unintentionally disrupting cables. The best protection is to publish cable routes to prevent accidental breaks.

NATO officials on Sunday warned about an increase in Russian submarine activity in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, saying that it was the highest-level of undersea activity from Moscow since the Cold War.

Jens Stoltenberg, secretary-general of the military alliance, told German Sunday newspaper _Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung_ that an additional 13 subs had been added to Moscow's fleet since 2014.

""Russia has massively invested in its marine capability, especially in submarines,"" he said. ""Russia's submarine activity is now at its highest level since the Cold War.""

He said that Moscow's fleet was now operating ""closer to our shores,"" as well as across the Atlantic.

The alliance's top submarine commander, Rear Adm. Andrew Lennon, reiterated Stoltenberg's comments.

""Russian submarine activity is higher now in the last three years than it has been since the Cold War,"" Lennon said.

Russia has used its submarine fleet to roam around North Atlantic seas close to rival countries' shorelines for years. It has also heightened tensions with NATO on land and air.

There are fears that Russia could use its greater presence in the waters near NATO territory to impact underwater communication lines that provide internet and telecommunications for both Europe and North America. Russia could either damage the lines or even tap into them, gathering intelligence.

""We are now seeing Russian underwater activity in the vicinity of undersea cables that I don't believe we have ever seen,"" Lennon told the Washington Post. ""Russia is clearly taking an interest in NATO and NATO nations' undersea infrastructure.""

Those cables, if affected, could impact trillions of dollars worth of global trade, or, if breached, could provide Moscow with an intelligence picture of the entire internet.

Lennon believes that Russia's deep-sea research submarines could have the capabilities to take action on the Atlantic seabed, where the cables are located.

""They can do oceanographic research, underwater intelligence gathering,"" he said.

""And what we have observed is an increased activity of that in the vicinity of undersea cables. We know that these auxiliary submarines are designed to work on the ocean floor, and they're transported by the mother ship, and we believe they may be equipped to manipulate objects on the ocean floor.""","The article discusses the increase in Russian submarine activity and its implications for undersea cables, including direct mentions of 'undersea cables' and concerns about their security.

It states that Russia's submarine presence could impact these cables, which are critical for global trade and internet connectivity.

This indicates that the topic of cut sea cables is treated as a significant concern within the article."
"What Connects the Global Internet? Undersea Wires in Garden Hose-Sized Tubes","Explores the extensive undersea cable network, detailing a 2008 incident that caused significant outages for millions due to cable damage.","https://theworld.org/stories/2015-04-20/what-links-global-internet-wires-inside-tubes-no-bigger-garden-hose","2023-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","",Yes,"Nicole Starosielski","Boston, Massachusetts, USA",-,"2023-02-27","English","The World from PRX","**What links the global Internet? Wires inside tubes no bigger than a garden hose.**

With cell phone, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth almost everywhere, it sometimes seems like we’ve finally ditched the cumbersome cords that are tethering us and our gadgets to Earth. But in reality, we live in a world that’s more wired than ever before — it's just that those wires are strung along the bottom of the world’s oceans.

“Ninety-nine percent of trans-oceanic data traffic, Internet traffic, goes underneath the ocean on the very bottom of the sea floor,” says Nicole Starosielski, an assistant professor of media, culture and communication at New York University. She’s the author of ""The Undersea Network,"" a book exploring this hidden world of cable.

The scale of the network is both superhuman and surprisingly mundane at the same time. The wires are strung along the ocean bed by large tankers, which carry enough cable to go across the entire Atlantic Ocean. But the cables themselves aren't that big.

“It’s about the size of a garden hose,” Starosielski says. “In Guam, for example, the cables run right over the shoreline. ... People step over them looking for the tourist attraction down the beach ... [and] have no idea the Internet is pulsing right underneath their feet.”

And that's why the biggest threat to these cables is humans, not sharks or other sea life. “The majority of the disruptions of our undersea network come from people dropping an anchor off their boat and hitting the cable, or a fisherman dragging a net on the bottom of the sea floor,” Starosielski explains — not exactly the usual cause that comes to mind when Google fails to reload.

The cables seemingly haven’t been targets for terrorists thus far. “Some in the industry speculate that is because they’re not a visible target,” says Starosielski, but it also could be due to a lack of reporting. She notes one incident off the coast of Egypt in 2008 when multiple cables broke in succession.

“This looked very suspicious,” she says. Though reports indicated the damage was due to ships dropping anchors in the area, videos didn’t show any vessels in the area at the right time. The resulting outage was huge, disconnecting approximately 60 million people in India, 12 million in Pakistan, six million in Egypt and almost five million in Saudi Arabia.

“There are certainly people who are worrying about the fact that our cable network isn’t totally diverse, and there are these critical single points of failure,” Starosielski says.

The Arctic Fibre Project, which is exploring laying fiber-optic cables in the Arctic Ocean, would help combat the lack of diversity. “We’ve never had a cable that has gone through the Arctic Ocean,"" Starosielski says. The cables would link Japan to the United Kingdom could zap data from one end to the other in just 154 milliseconds.

But terrorism or human error aside, the cables were built to last. They can withstand the inhospitable ocean floor for 25 years, and, as Starosielski notes, “what else of the Internet has been instituted and stayed the same for 25 years?""

They transport 99 percent of all transoceanic digital communications, including phone calls, text and e-mail messages, websites, digital images and video, and even some television (cumulatively, over thirty trillion bits per second as of 2010). It is submarine systems, rather than satellites, that carry most of the Internet across the oceans. Cables drive international business: they facilitate the expansion of multinational corporations, enable the outsourcing of operations, and transmit the high-speed financial transactions that connect the world’s economies. Stephen Malphrus, staff director at the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, has stated that if the cable networks are disrupted, “the financial services sector does not ‘grind to a halt,’ rather it snaps to a halt.

As a result, the reliability of undersea cables has been deemed “absolutely essential” for the functioning of governments and the enforcement of national security. Militaries use the cables to manage long-range weapons tests and remote battlefield operations. Undersea networks also make possible new distributions of transnational media that depend on high-capacity digital exchange, from the collaborations of production companies in the United States and New Zealand on the 2009 film _Avatar_ to the global coordination of _World of Warcraft_ players. At the same time, cable infrastructure enables modes of resistance that challenge dominant media formations. Messages produced by the Arab Spring and Occupy movements traveled between countries on undersea cables. If the world’s 223 international undersea cable systems were to suddenly disappear, only a minuscule amount of this traffic would be backed up by satellite, and the Internet would effectively be split between continents.

Packet-switching technology, which forms the basis for the Internet’s distributive operations, is often understood in terms of its potential to survive an attack: if several nodes in a network are disrupted, the system’s routing can in theory move traffic around them. The relative centralization of the cable system and its embeddedness in existing territorialities make the physical networks across which these packets move far less resilient than we imagine. In 2006 an earthquake near Taiwan set off an undersea landslide and snapped several cables. Another significant outage happened in Vietnam in 2007, when cable thieves pulled up several of the country’s working lines. In 2011 a woman in Georgia shut down much of the Internet in Armenia when she dug up two fiber-optic lines while looking for scrap metal. Although network carriers are often able to reroute traffic, in many cases, breaks have decreased Internet connectivity. Repairing undersea networks is dependent on a limited number of specialized cable ships, and in some places, including China, Italy, and Indonesia, companies have had to wait to receive permits before they can fix their systems.

Although the Internet is often imagined as a clean and durable technology, something that will eventually be extended everywhere at little cost, this vision fails to register the extensive financial, social, and environmental investments required to establish new systems and maintain existing ones. Taking this into consideration, we might think about the Internet not as a renewable resource but as a precarious platform, especially as moving our data to the cloud often entails increased dependence on undersea links. On one hand, this might help us make better choices about our own media consumption and content production, taking into account the potential precariousness of infrastructural systems. On the other hand, it might motivate us to push for a more genuinely distributed, resilient, and equitable network.","The article ""The Undersea Network That Connects the World"" discusses the critical role of undersea fiber-optic cables in global communications, including direct implications of cable disruptions.

It mentions specific incidents where undersea cables were cut or damaged, such as the earthquake near Taiwan in 2006 and cable thefts in Vietnam in 2007.

These discussions highlight the significant impact of such disruptions on internet connectivity and telecommunications.

The UK's most senior military officer has warned of a new threat posed by Russia to communications and internet cables that run under the sea.

Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, the chief of the defence staff, said Britain and Nato needed to prioritise protecting the lines of communication.

He said it would ""immediately and potentially catastrophically"" hit the economy if they were cut or disrupted.

The cables criss-cross the seabed, connecting up countries and continents.

The world's submarine network comprises an estimated 213 independent cable systems and 545,018 miles (877,121 km) of fibre, according to a recent report for the Policy Exchange think tank.

But it said a lack of formal state ownership meant cables do not have strong protection in international law.

Despite that, an estimated 97% of global communications and $10 trillion in daily financial transactions are transmitted by cables under the ocean.

Speaking to the Royal United Services Institute defence think tank, Sir Stuart said the vulnerability of undersea lines posed a ""new risk to our way of life"".

He said Nato had prioritised the protection of the cables ""in response to the threat posed by the modernisation of the Russian navy, both nuclear and conventional submarines and ships"".

He said it was ""very, very important"" to understand how crucial that mission was for Nato.

Fears of Russia cutting, disrupting or ""wire tapping"" undersea communication lines are growing. Defence and intelligence chiefs see not just increased Russian submarine activity, but its willingness to use unconventional asymmetric warfare.

Sir Stuart said: ""There is a new risk to our way of life, which is the vulnerability of the cables that criss-cross the seabeds. Can you imagine a scenario where those cables are cut or disrupted, which would immediately and potentially catastrophically affect both our economy and other ways of living.""

According to the Policy Exchange report - published earlier this month - many cable systems are potentially at risk. ""Undersea cables are the indispensable infrastructure of our time, essential to our modern life and digital economy, yet they are inadequately protected and highly vulnerable to attack at sea and on land, from both hostile states and terrorists,"" the report concluded.

Writing a foreword to the document, Admiral James Stavridis, a former US Navy officer, said: ""It is not satellites in the sky, but pipes on the ocean floor that form the backbone of the world's economy."" He also warned of a potential threat from China and Iran, as well as Russia. He called for the creation of more ""dark cables"", to be kept in reserve, and said Nato must be prepared to defend global submarine cables, if necessary.

The internet has been the driving innovation of 21st Century life but the world started to become ""connected"" more than 160 years ago. The race to lay an undersea or ""submarine"" cable began soon after the first telegraph signal was sent in the 1830s. By 1850 Britain and France were linked. Investment in undersea cables did not, of course, stop and the fibre-optic lines of today carry more than 97% of all communication traffic.","The article discusses the risks posed by Russia to undersea cables, explicitly mentioning the potential for these cables to be 'cut or disrupted.'

Russian submarines have dramatically stepped up activity around undersea data cables in the North Atlantic, part of a more aggressive naval posture that has driven NATO to revive a Cold War-era command, according to senior military officials.

The apparent Russian focus on the cables, which provide internet and other communications connections to North America and Europe, could give the Kremlin the power to sever or tap into vital data lines. Russian submarine activity has increased to levels unseen since the Cold War, prompting hunts for these elusive watercraft.

NATO has responded with plans to re-establish a command post to help secure the North Atlantic, boosting anti-submarine warfare capabilities and developing advanced submarine-detecting planes.

The cables are crucial for global communication and if severed, could disrupt the internet and affect the economy significantly. The Russian Defense Ministry did not respond to requests for comment.

The activity has forced a revival of Western sub-hunting skills that lay dormant since the Cold War, as NATO allies have long practiced submarine-hunting but had few practical needs for close tracking until recently. Submarines are particularly potent war-fighting crafts, and Russia's enhanced submarine capabilities give urgency to NATO's new efforts to ensure rapid military response across Europe.

Over 400 fiber optic cables carry 99% of transoceanic data, providing the physical links that bind our digital world together. This global infrastructure rests almost entirely in the hands of private companies.

In the modern geopolitical environment, the vulnerability of undersea communications cables stands out as an acute cyber security concern. Relatively little attention, however, has focused on the legal frameworks that govern the networks of glass and steel that form the literal backbone of our internet. This post lays out the threats to communications cables and the existing international laws protecting cables from intentional damage.

**Threats to Undersea Cables**

_Physical Attack_

Physical damage is the most direct threat to undersea cables. Such damage is usually accidental—often the cause is fishing ship nets and anchors. But history is rife with examples of navies intentionally attacking cables. At the outbreak of World War I, Britain severed all but one of Germany’s undersea telegraph lines. The British tapped the remaining cable, which allowed them to intercept communications (including those with important geopolitical consequences, such as the Zimmerman telegram that helped push the U.S. into the war). The Germans, lacking a fleet of cable ships of their own, attacked British telegraph cable landing sites in the Pacific Ocean. This case illustrates three cable vulnerabilities that still exist today: direct cutting, tapping and targeting landing sites.

States have long recognized that cables are vital to secure communication. In 1959, a Soviet trawler cut five cables off the coast of Newfoundland, prompting the U.S. to send a radar ship to board the trawler under the provisions of the 1884 Submarine Cable Convention. The 1884 treaty prohibits intentional damage to cables and allows navies to board vessels to investigate reports of damage. The incident was followed by a diplomatic exchange of notes in which the United States said: “The protection of submarine telecommunications cables on the high seas constitutes an international obligation.”

More recently, Bangladeshi authorities determined that an intentional cable outage in 2007 cost Bangladesh’s telecommunication company over $1 million. In 2013, Egyptian authorities discovered three scuba divers attempting to cut a cable off the port of Alexandria. The cable industry estimates that over 150 faults in cable connectivity occur every year, but because the vast majority are isolated incidents, network redundancy limits their effects. It is far more problematic to lose all cables in a specific area: An 2006 earthquake off the coast of Taiwan struck a concentration of cables in the nearby ocean and disrupted internet traffic across Asia, causing months of slow connectivity.

Recognizing the grave possible consequences, the United States takes threats to cables seriously. In 2015, Russian ships and submarines near cable routes around the world caused concern within the U.S. intelligence community that Russia was attempting to tap or cut critical internet communications lines. A Cold War-style drama played out between the Russian subs following cable lines and the American ships, subs and spy satellites tracking them. These incidents highlighted the danger of cutting cables in deep water, where repairing them could take weeks or months.

_Network Attack_

Today, in addition to physical threats, submarine cable systems face significant virtual vulnerabilities. The consortiums of companies that operate submarine cables (which are worth hundreds of millions of dollars) use network-management software to control the wavelengths that transmit gigabits of data at high speed along the ocean floor. These systems allow operators to monitor data traffic, see cable faults, and add or drop wavelengths transmitting data (resembling other Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems). They enable remote control of entire cables and are vulnerable to a wide array of attacks because they use common operating systems like Linux and Windows. Furthermore, network management systems often are connected to remote operating centers through networked connections and even linked to the internet. Michael Sechrist wrote about the systems’ risks:

> What is the nightmare scenario? A hacker penetrates a cable management system, gains administrative rights, and hacks into the presentation server … Hackers could then attain unprecedented top-level views of multiple cable networks and data flows, discover physical cable vulnerabilities, and disrupt and divert data traffic. With that access, hackers/attackers can gain a potential “kill click” – with a click of a mouse they can delete wavelengths and, potentially, significantly disrupt or alter global Internet traffic routes.

Many network management systems are not up-to-date, including older Siemens systems. The Stuxnet worm hit Siemens SCADA systems worldwide and ultimately targeted Iran’s nuclear centrifuges—highlighting how malware can attack critical infrastructure vulnerabilities. One Stuxnet lesson of relevance to undersea cables is how the virus masked its presence by feeding false information to monitoring centers. If a piece of malware similarly hides its effects on cable traffic, the time it would take to identify the faults with the system could prolong global disruptions.

**International Law on Damage to Submarine Cables**

Understanding the international laws governing cables is essential to protecting them.

First, international law differentiates between attacks on cables and espionage. Spying operations on cables consist of passively tapping the information coming through the pipes at landing sites.

The earliest international law agreement on the topic is the Convention on the Protection of Submarine Cables, signed in Paris in 1884. The treaty applies to all cables outside the territorial waters of states and requires all states to incorporate its protections into their domestic law. (The relevant U.S. provision is 47 U.S.C. § 21-39.) Article 2 mandates that “the breaking or injury of a submarine cables, done willfully or through culpable negligence...shall be a punishable offense.” In Article 12, the parties agree to implement national legislation to impose the penalties for violating the treaty. Notably, Article 15 says its provisions “shall in no wise [sic] affect the liberty of action of belligerents.” Thus, in wartime, the protections do not apply.

Maritime law is also important to undersea cable governance. The 1958 Geneva Conference on the Law of the Sea addressed submarine cables in two treaties, the Convention on the High Seas and the Convention on the Continental Shelf. The High Seas Convention included the submarine cable protections of the 1884 Convention but in the context of the “freedom to lay submarine cables,” a fundamental freedoms of the high seas “recognized by the general principles of international law.” Article 27 addresses damage to cables, but it does not explicitly prohibit the intentional damage to them. Instead, it mandates that states party to the treaty “take the necessary legislative measures” to make breaking a cable a “punishable offense.”

The 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) superseded the 1958 Geneva Conventions. This landmark agreement addressed submarine cables in multiple chapters. Articles 113-115 replicate the language from the 1958 convention requiring states to enact domestic legislation penalizing damage to cables by ships or p.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, including their vulnerabilities, legal protections, and specific incidents of damage.

Alarm bells went off following reports last week that the U.S. is concerned about Russian ships operating near vital undersea cables, and that Russia could damage those cables in times of conflict or tension. At stake is the safety of the vast network of cables around the globe that carry almost all of the world’s Internet communications and financial transactions. As it happens, Russia may not have an incentive to damage those cables, since it would also suffer from any disruption in communications, according to experts at Wharton and New York University. However, the threat of cyber attacks on those cables is real, they said.

Severed cables can be easily repaired, albeit with heavy costs, and the bigger risk is from unintentional, routine cable breaks. The best defense against such threats is to avoid the existing concentration of cable landings along U.S. coasts, according to the experts. Instead, those landings should be dispersed so that all systems don’t go down in a crisis and have sufficient capacity to re-route communications traffic, they said.

The first reports last week painted a grim scenario. “The ultimate Russian hack on the United States could involve severing the fiber-optic cables at some of their hardest-to-access locations to halt the instant communications on which the West’s governments, economies and citizens have grown dependent,” a _New York Times_ report warned. The U.S. has not formally responded to the perceived Russian threat, but the _Times_ report quoted a Navy spokesman who said, “It would be a concern to hear any country was tampering with communication cables.” Coincidentally, President Obama had designated October as “[National Cyber Security Awareness Month](http://www.dhs.gov/national-cyber-security-awareness-month)” to raise awareness about cyber security.

**What Is at Stake?**

The consequences would be huge in the event of “a systematic, large-scale attempt” to break undersea cables that proves difficult to remediate, said Wharton risk management professor [Robert Meyer](https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/205/). It could disrupt up to 90% of global Internet traffic and financial transactions, he added. Meyer is also co-director of Wharton’s [Risk Management and Decision Processes Center.](http://riskcenter.wharton.upenn.edu/) However, he said it isn’t clear if Russia would want to damage the cables. “If you are sitting on a limb, [would] you want to cut off the branch?” Such damage is more likely caused by terrorists, he added.

> “The more viable option is to build a more geographically diverse network of cables.” –Nicole Starosielski

Undersea cables routinely snap and get quickly repaired, noted [Nicole Starosielski](http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/faculty/Nicole_Starosielski), professor of media, culture and communication at New York University’s Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. She rated attempts to protect undersea cables with patrolling ships as an unviable idea, given the vastness of the network. “The cables could be broken by any boat that drops an anchor,” she said. “The biggest threats are regular, unintentional breaks” – not intentional disruption.

“The more viable option is to build a more geographically diverse network of cables,” said Starosielski. She is also the author of _The Undersea Network_, a book that looked at the collection of undersea cables built over 150 years. She noted industry groups have for long sought policies that would facilitate the development of cable networks that avoid the concentration of pressure points along both U.S. coasts.

Meyer and Starosielski discussed ways to mitigate threats to subsea cables on the Knowledge at Wharton show [on Wharton Business Radio on SiriusXM channel 111](http://businessradio.wharton.upenn.edu/). (Listen to the podcast at the top of this page.)

Starosielski noted that while concerns about the security of undersea cables are not new, they are heightened now because of the widespread dependency on them. She pointed out that it is difficult to calculate the economic cost of damage to those cables, but added that some estimates put it at more than a billion dollars for South Korea and $3 billion for Australia, for example.

**Perils of Concentration**

Starosielski pointed to tele-geography maps that reveal the “pressure points,” or the concentration of the cable landings in the U.S. Many cable landings are around New York, in Long Island and New Jersey, among other locations, and then around Miami – but there are no other cable landings in between those two clusters on the U.S. East Coast. On the U.S. West Coast, the major cable landings are concentrated around Los Angeles, San Francisco, central California and Oregon, she noted.

“In the U.S., we have about 50 cables coming in to about 20 zones – they are not evenly distributed along the coast; they are clumped together,” said Starosielski. Typically, if a cable is cut, and it does not exclusively belong to any country, the traffic it carries is re-routed to another cable because they are not all full, she explained. But there could be major problems if the cables that are cut are in the pressure points.

> “The biggest threats are regular, unintentional breaks – not intentional disruption.” –Nicole Starosielski

The concentration of cable landings occurs because cable companies find it more economically viable to go to an existing cable station, where they can interconnect with all the other networks, said Starosielski. “There is not an economic incentive to diversify the network.”

One comforting fact, according to Starosielski, is that much of the U.S. communications infrastructure is within the country in the form of data centers and Internet exchanges, unlike some other countries that depend on overseas infrastructure. “If you were to sever these [cables], it would cause a catastrophic impact, especially on financial institutions, but it would not necessarily sever us from all networks,” she said. “But that is not true for all countries.”

**Low Threat Visibility**

Meyer pointed to inadequacies in the perceptions of those threats faced by undersea cables and landing stations. “Many people, including in government, are not aware of the scale of the importance of cables and how they are the lifeblood of global communications,” he said. Starosielski noted that that the each cable is usually the size of a garden hose, but carries massive amounts of information. “An entire country could make phone calls at the same time through one of these cables,” she noted.

Meyer recalled the findings of a survey last year at the World Economic Forum of 900 business leaders and academics, in which cyber attacks ranked No. 10 on a list of potential threats. When respondents were asked about which attacks would have the greatest impact, cyber attacks did not even make it to the Top 10, he added. Meyer attributed those responses to a mistaken belief that inherent redundancy would take care of any attack on the cables. “The mere knowledge that we have these wires going underneath the ocean that one can clip … would be a wakeup call for a lot of people.”

**Repairs and Re-routing**

As it happens, repairs of undersea cables are not exactly high-tech, although they could be expensive if they are far out in the ocean, said Starosielski. Typically, damaged cables are brought up from the deep ocean and the two ends are spliced together on the surface before being lowered again in the sea. Repairs to cables in coastal locations sometimes prove difficult and time-consuming as they require permits from governments, she added.

> “The mere knowledge that we have these wires going underneath the ocean that one can clip … would be a wakeup call for a lot of people.” –Robert Meyer

The ordinary citizen does not feel disruptions because redundancies in the system absorb the re-routing of traffic from broken cables, said Starosielski. However, when cable breaks occur in any of the pressure points, or zones of concentration of landings, the impact could be huge, said Starosielski.

For example, the 2006 Hengchun earthquake off Taiwan triggered an undersea landslide that severed nine of the 11 cables running through the Luzon Strait between Taiwan and the Philippines, and took 49 days to be repaired, said Starosielski. However, the 2011 Fukushima earthquake in Japan did not cause as much disruption because the cable networks were more diverse and not concentrated, she added.

**Facing Vulnerabilities**

According to Meyer, the biggest concern is not that the cables would be cut, but the threat of hack attacks into the information they carry. He noted that cable networks are typically managed by remote software installations. “If a terrorist were to get hold of the management system and take the information from there, they would get access to the financial information which is flowing,” he said. “That would be much scarier and more difficult thing to control than simply cutting the cables, because — as Nicole [Starosielski] said — we could get a ship out and splice it back together again.”

Meyer called for a stronger appreciation of the repercussions of attacks on undersea cables to drive business and policy responses. He talked of “a tendency to worry about … the failures [that are] most easy to imagine.” Even if damaged cables could be repaired, an understanding of “how people’s lives would be disrupted by a five- or six-day shutdown of all financial transactions and the Internet would have a profound impact,” he said. “It is one of a number of risks that are sitting out there and would have very large impact that people don’t particularly think about, and the hope is we don’t have to worry about it.","The article 'Managing Risks for the World’s Undersea Cable Network' provides a comprehensive discussion on undersea cables, including direct mentions of their risks, potential for being cut, and the implications for global internet connectivity and financial transactions.

**Published Date:** November 03, 2015

A small, bipartisan group of senators including Chris Murphy, D-Conn., have written to the secretaries of defense, state and homeland security, asking for information on ""steps taken to enhance the security of our vital undersea network,"" after recent reports of Russian ships operating near undersea fiber optic cables.

The majority of the world's telecommunications and Internet traffic flow through these cables, which are usually 1 to 2 inches thick.

""Undersea communication cables are responsible for moving trillions of dollars in global business, more than 95 percent of daily communications, and matters extremely significant to our national security,"" the senators' letter says.

The senators are ""increasingly concerned"" about cables whose locations are well known and carry data important to our economy and military.

The first transatlantic cables were laid in the 1860s, according to Thomas Fedyszyn, a member of the Naval War College's Naval Security Affairs faculty.

""It's always been presumed that militaries will always have additional cables that will carry classified materials,"" Fedyszyn said.

The New York Times last month reported that ""Russian submarines and spy ships are aggressively operating near the vital undersea cables that carry almost all global Internet communications.""

Murphy stated, ""Maybe it's just a threat, but the Russians wouldn't be snooping around these undersea cables unless they are trying to send a message that they have the capacity to interrupt undersea communications.""

The U.S. government considers the undersea cables ""critical infrastructure."" The Obama Administration's 2015 National Security Strategy states: ""We are fortifying our critical infrastructure against all hazards, especially cyber espionage and attack.""

In their letter, the senators requested information on what steps are being taken, and what steps need to be taken, in order to enhance the security of the undersea network on which the U.S. depends. They wish to discuss this matter further in a classified setting, while allowing the public to know they are taking every step to maintain their security.

As for the vulnerability of the cables, Fedyszyn said, ""If found and the enemy wants them cut, I would say very vulnerable.""","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, mentioning their critical role in global communications and national security.

It highlights concerns about their vulnerability, especially in light of Russian military activities nearby, and discusses the implications of what could happen if these cables were cut.

This aligns well with the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables, as it treats the subject as a central theme rather than a minor mention."

And its appearance coincides with what researchers say is a marked uptick in the instability of Internet traffic in that country.

The ship, named Yantar, is currently positioned off the coast of Lebanon and is moving on a northern track towards Syria. Dyn, a U.S.-based company that tracks Internet outages around the world, reports a dip in the number of available networks in Syria in recent days.

Undersea cables are frequently cut by accident, including by ship anchors dragging on the ocean floor. It’s possible that the Internet outages in Syria and Yantar’s presence in the neighborhood are merely a coincidence.

But the Internet in Syria has a history of going down at times that the regime of Bashar al-Assad has plotted military offensives, raising the possibility that Russia may be assisting in a communications blackout as its military forces pound rebel positions in the beleaguered city of Aleppo.

The ship is technically classified as a research vessel, but it’s equipped with a pair of remote submarines that U.S. officials have said are capable of severing the cables miles under the ocean’s surface that carry global Internet communications.

Yantar cruised off the coast of the United States last year en route to Cuba, and was monitored along the way by American intelligence satellites. At the time, officials said they were monitoring a surge in Russian submarine activity along undersea cable routes.

Defense officials told The Daily Beast that they couldn’t confirm the presence of the Yantar near the Syrian coast.

Undersea cable map  

Late last October David Sanger and Eric Schmitt wrote an interesting story in the New York Times outlining US concerns about Russian navy activity near the world’s undersea cables. They said:

> Russian submarines and spy ships are aggressively operating near the vital undersea cables that carry almost all global Internet communications, raising concerns among some American military and intelligence officials that the Russians might be planning to attack those lines in times of tension or conflict.

> The issue goes beyond old worries during the Cold War that the Russians would tap into the cables — a task American intelligence agencies also mastered decades ago. The alarm today is deeper: The ultimate Russian hack on the United States could involve severing the fiber-optic cables at some of their hardest-to-access locations to halt the instant communications on which the West’s governments, economies and citizens have grown dependent.

You got the sense from the story that intelligence officials wanted to get the story out:

> In private, however, commanders and intelligence officials are far more direct. They report that from the North Sea to Northeast Asia and even in waters closer to American shores, they are monitoring significantly increased Russian activity along the known routes of the cables, which carry the lifeblood of global electronic communications and commerce.

Let’s think about this for a minute. If a war were to take place between NATO and, say, Russia, what would be some likely Russian strategies? Clearly US officials are expressing concern here about undersea cables, which carry the bulk of internet traffic globally — most specifically between the US and Europe.

In such a scenario it would make sense for Russia not simply to cut these cables, but instead to mine them — and mine them in multiple locations. Indeed you could argue it would make sense to mine them in advance of any possible conflict, but merely as a contingency. So maybe they already are? And it might be also logical to conclude that NATO might do the same, though that seems a little less likely.

If an adversary could cut most or all commercial undersea cables simultaneously (nevermind the secret military ones) it would have a hugely destabilising affect on Western economies. Communications during or in the leadup to conflict are obviously critical, but since the end of the Cold War large portions of global commerce also rely on these undersea cables — which by their nature are vulnerable. Here’s some stuff from McKinsey, emphasis mine:

> New McKinsey research into the Internet economies of the G-8 nations as well as Brazil, China, India, South Korea, and Sweden finds that the web accounts for a significant and growing portion of global GDP. Indeed, if measured as a sector, Internet-related consumption and expenditure is now bigger than agriculture or energy. On average, the Internet contributes 3.4 percent to GDP in the 13 countries covered by the research — an amount the size of Spain or Canada in terms of GDP, and growing at a faster rate than that of Brazil.

Besides the affect on GDP, there’s also the affect on trading and international markets.

And don’t forget yourself: if those undersea cables were cut tomorrow, your reliance on cloud-based services would immediately become a liability. No more Google Drive, Gmail, Netflix, Dropbox, Amazon, or any of the other services you rely on daily for storing your files or organising yourself. In fact, try using your laptop for a day without internet access. Those of us who used computers in the early 1990s remember those days, but many people have no concept of what this feels like.

We have become so used to broadband and cloud storage that we forget nowadays that our computers are often merely dumb terminals, interfacing with a large infrastructure that does most of the heavy lifting.

If you were a worrier, I’d invest in some hard drives and store your key stuff locally. It’s good practice regardless of any future global conflagration.","The article discusses the vulnerabilities of undersea cables, mentioning potential threats from Russian military activity and the implications of cutting these cables.

It highlights the critical role of undersea cables in global communications and commerce, making it a central theme of the piece.

Key phrases such as 'cut most or all commercial undersea cables' and discussions about the impact on internet connectivity further substantiate its relevance to the criterion."

This week, the New York Times published a longer article, speculating the ""Yantar"" is part of a larger Russian intelligence operation collecting information about deep sea communication cables.

The newspaper has spoken to commanders and intelligence officials reporting significantly increased Russian activity along the known routes of underwater cables, from the North Sea to Northeast Asia. Pentagon officials suspect the vessel’s equipment is being used to surveil the seafloor for sensors, and may even be cutting underwater communication cables.

Underwater communication cables are vital to global data communications, both civilian and military.

While US spy agencies might believe the ""Yantar"" is a spy-vessel, the Russian Navy insists it is an oceanographic research vessel.

Northern fleet Commander Admiral Vladimir Korolev said in his speech while welcoming the vessel to Severomorsk that ""Yantar"" will help raise hydrographic and research activities in the Oceans to a new quality level. The Admiral said this would especially be the case in the Arctic. Photos of the vessel's arrival to Severomorsk is posted on the portal of the Russian Ministry of Defence.

The New York Times writes the vessel has two deep-diving mini-submarines on board. After cruising the East Coast of the United States on southbound route towards Cuba, the vessel crossed the Atlantic and was last weekend sailing northbound the coast of Norway towards Russia’s Kola Peninsula, where the Northern fleet has its main base in Severomorsk north of Murmansk.","The article discusses the Russian vessel 'Yantar' and its operations related to undersea cables.

Concern subs, spy ships could cut undersea Internet links or tap them (like NSA has).

A map of the (major) submarine cables connecting the United States and the rest of North America, the Caribbean, South America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Pacific. Much of global commerce is dependent on this network.

The Russian Navy's ocean surveillance ship Yantar, recently seen in the Caribbean following cable lays between islands.

The USNS Impeccable, the US Navy's newest undersea surveillance ship, conducts similar surveys and detects submarine operating areas.

The USNS Able, another Navy undersea surveillance ship, with its Surveillance Towed Array Sonar System (SURTASS) gear visible on its aft end. The low-frequency sonar array maps the sea floor and everything sitting on it.

The USS Halibut, the first special operations submarine of the US Navy known to have taken part in a cable surveillance operation. The USS Jimmy Carter is its latest successor.

_The New York Times_ reports that US defense and intelligence officials have been expressing increased concern about the ""aggressive"" activities by the Russian Navy's submarine and spy ship fleet in the proximity of critical undersea communications cables, perhaps assessing them for potential attack in the event of a crisis. There's no evidence that the Russians (or anyone else) have cut cables yet, but the intelligence agencies of the US and its allies have observed increased activity by the Russian fleet along cable routes, even close to the United States.

The US has long been known to have tapped undersea cables for intelligence collection. One early example is a US program in the 1970s called Operation Ivy Bells, which attached a listening device to Soviet communications cables in the Sea of Okhostsk linking facilities in the Kuril Island chain, recording unencrypted communications on tapes that were retrieved by divers monthly. The program ended in 1981 after a National Security Agency employee sold information about the program to the Soviets for $35,000.

While no US Navy or intelligence officials would go on the record regarding their concerns, the Navy's Commander of US Naval Forces Europe and US Naval Forces Africa, Admiral Mark Furguson, noted that Russian submarine patrols have risen in number by nearly 50 percent in the last year. Unnamed military and intelligence officials told the _Times_ that much of the activity is happening along cable routes. A European diplomat, unnamed by _NYT_, was quoted as saying, ""The level of activity is comparable to what we saw in the Cold War.""

In September, the Russian Navy's oceanographic research ship Yantar, carrying unmanned underwater surveillance vehicles, was observed operating near the US Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and elsewhere in the Caribbean. According to reports, it was believed to be surveying Caribbean undersea cable networks. The US operates similar ships, including the USNS Impeccable (T-AGOS-23), which conduct underwater ""surveys"" with devices such as the Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System (SURTASS). One of those surveys happened in the South China Sea in 2009 and led to a confrontation with Chinese naval vessels.

While cable breaks happen all the time because of seismic activity or even shark attacks, a concerted effort to cut multiple undersea cables could cause disruption of the global Internet and have both economic and military repercussions. Despite its network of communications satellites, the US military is heavily dependent on undersea cables for much of its communications.

While it's possible that the Russians could simply be looking for locations where submarines can deploy gear and possibly divers to tap into communications cables for surveillance purposes, officials told the _Times_ it is more likely that they were looking for hard-to-reach locations to cut cables during future operations. Such locations would make it difficult and time-consuming to repair cables, maximizing the impact of cuts.","The article discusses the Russian Navy's activities near undersea cables and the potential for these activities to result in cutting cables.

While it does not explicitly mention 'cut sea cables,' it raises concerns about possible future disruptions and the strategic importance of these cables.

The focus on military activities and their implications for undersea cables satisfies the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables."

As the _New York Times_‘ David Sanger and Eric Schmitt report, “Russian submarines and spy ships are aggressively operating near the vital undersea cables that carry almost all global Internet communications, raising concerns among some American military and intelligence officials that the Russians might be planning to attack those lines in times of conflict.”

As Navy spokesman Cmdr. William Marks adds, “It would be a concern to hear any country was tampering with communication cables.” Indeed. Well, unless those tampering with international communication cables happen to be working on behalf of the “good guys” in the National Security Agency, or their equally good partners in Britain’s GCHQ. In that case, don’t consider it “tampering,” but rather something more akin to protecting the homeland from 21st century threats.

Of course whenever official Washington warns of a looming foreign cyber threat (China and Iran being the other favorite punching bags of the _Times_ in this regard), it’s worth remembering that it was in fact the U.S., in partnership with Israel, that was the first state to actually launch a major offensive cyber attack on a sovereign nation. The attack being the Stuxnet virus set loose back in 2009 on Iran’s peaceful nuclear program. Such aggression was codified earlier this year when the Pentagon formally unveiled a cyber warfare doctrine sanctioning the use of preemptive strikes. But down the memory hole, it appears, with all that.

And so with all that out of mind, it’s back to Russia’s rising “aggression.” At least as the paper of record would have it.

As Sanger and Schmitt continue, “American concern over cable-cutting is just one aspect of Russia’s modernizing Navy that has drawn new scrutiny.”

Adm. Mark Ferguson, commander of American naval forces in Europe, speaking in Washington this month, said the proficiency and operational tempo of the Russian submarine force was increasing. Citing public remarks by the Russian Navy chief, Adm. Viktor Chirkov, Admiral Ferguson said the intensity of Russian submarine patrols had risen by almost 50 percent over the last year. Russia has increased its operating tempo to levels not seen in over a decade. Russian Arctic bases and their $2.4 billion investment in the Black Sea Fleet expansion by 2020 demonstrate their commitment to develop their military infrastructure on the flanks, he said.

Left unmentioned by either Adm. Ferguson or the _Times_ is the fact that the U.S. Navy’s fiscal year 2016 budget comes in at an astounding $161 billion. (For comparison, the _entire_ Russian military’s FY 2016 budget is projected to come in just over $90 billion.) If scrutiny then is to be applied, one would think that the U.S. Navy’s budgetary windfall would offer plenty of fodder. For starters, it’s worth considering just how many food-insecure American children could be fed with $161 billion.

Capturing the essence of the official propaganda campaign seeking to depict Russia as some sort of dangerously revisionist power, Sanger and Schmitt go on in their piece to quote Adm. James Stavridis, NATO’s former top military commander and current dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. As Stavridis puts it, Russia’s supposed stepped up surveillance of undersea cables offers “yet another example of a highly assertive and aggressive regime seemingly reaching backwards for the tools of the Cold War, albeit with a high degree of technical improvement.” Russia has indeed deployed its military forces in the last year to both Ukraine and Syria. (A fact _Times_ readers are certainly well aware of.) But if that is a sign of a “highly assertive and aggressive regime,” what are we to make of a regime that in the past decade alone invaded and toppled governments in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya? What shall we call a regime that has bombed Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Libya, Yemen, Syria, and Pakistan? What about a regime that unleashed a preemptive cyber attack on Iran? How about a regime with over 800 foreign military bases? Or one that exported nearly $50 billion in arms in the last year alone?

Global public opinion has of course already settled on what we are to call such a regime. According to a 2013 WIN/Gallop poll surveying the opinions of individuals from 65 nations around the world, it is the U.S. that constitutes “the greatest threat to peace in the world.” Russia didn’t register in the poll.

The recent historical record, then, reveals the latest Russian hit piece offered by the _Times_ to be little more than Washington projection. The Russian Navy, all propaganda aside, hardly possesses much of a noteworthy threat to the U.S. Navy, let alone global Internet communications. To find the greatest threat to global Internet communications we must once again heed global public opinion and come face to face with the menace within.","The article titled ""NYT Hypes Russian Threat to the Internet"" by Ben Schreiner discusses concerns regarding Russian military activities near undersea cables, which are crucial for global internet communications.

Almost all the countries in the world expect their foreign intelligence services to tap and sift through international telecommunications. For that reason, network operators whose lines cross international borders are legally obliged to make certain intersection points available to the authorities. Britain's Tempora program, for instance, had perfectly legal access to the information it obtained - at least when it passed through British territory.

But fiber-optic cables can also be tapped secretly, without the knowledge of the operators - though this is not exactly easy. To understand how it works, one has to look more closely at how the data actually passes through the cables.

A standard fiber-optic cable laid across land consists of 144 individual glass fibers, while undersea cables consist of a maximum of eight individual fibers. Using laser technology, the electronic data is initially turned into ultra-short flashes of light. These flashes represent the zeros and ones that all digital information is comprised of. A photodiode at the end of the cable turns the light flashes back into electrical signals.

Around 10 billion such flashes of light run through these cables every second, and each one can also transfer between 1.2 and 5 gigabytes of data per second. But since the capacity of fiber optics is never completely used up, in practice the data flow is usually equivalent to between one and five standard CDs.

**Fiber optics need amplifiers**

But after a certain distance, the data signal drops. Every 80 kilometers or so, the signals have to be re-amplified, explained Klaus-Dieter Langer of the Fraunhofer Heinrich-Hertz-Institute in Berlin.

Thousands of miles of fiber optic cables are laid across the ocean floor. This is done with the help of a ""regenerator."" Undersea cables also have regenerators, which are supplied with electricity by copper cables laid across the ocean floor, together with the fiber optics.

These regenerators are the system's weak point. At these spots, the fiber optics can be more easily tapped, because they are no longer bundled together, rather laid out individually (since each fiber must be amplified separately). At these points, data piracy is not necessarily easy - but that, as Langer puts it, is ""just a technical hurdle.""

A vigilant network operator can spot such hacking attempts. ""You need very sensitive measuring instruments,"" said Langer, ""then you can see when the signal strength suddenly dips.""

**Order in the data chaos**

Once a spy has succeeded in hacking into a cable, the bigger challenge emerges - sifting through the immense mass of data. This needs to be done quickly. Even if a single glass cable is operating only at 50 percent capacity, it can still deliver 10 terabytes of data in an hour. ""Since storage capacity is finite, the trick is to analyze these 10 terabytes within an hour, and filter out what you're looking for,"" said Langer.

A lot of the data needs to be decrypted - which also means being temporarily stored. At the same time, intelligence agencies must proceed very selectively so as not to get bogged down in the flood of data. Langer believes that agents probably concentrate on single fibers belonging to certain operators of particular interest. ""It makes more sense to search for certain content, rather than, for example, email conversations, telephone connections and the like.""

**Wire-tapping contest under the ocean**

Hacking a cable only makes sense if you have large server capacity immediately available, which is why Langer is skeptical of recent media speculation about the USS Jimmy Carter, a nuclear submarine said to be on a mission to tap underwater cables. ""It seems bizarre,"" said Langer.

Huge server capacity must be immediately available to sift data. But Peter Franck, spokesman for the Chaos Computer Club digital rights collective, considers the submarine reports ""absolutely believable."" Though tapping underwater cables is so secret ""that it would never be publicly talked about,"" so far reports in the American media have not been denied by the government.

Franck can imagine a number of ways in which data could be moved from the submarine to servers on shore. He speculates, for instance, that the data could be pre-filtered on board and then broadcast to a base via the normal radio communication. Or a device that records the data could be left on the ocean floor. ""An extra vehicle could then come and pick it up,"" Franck suggested.

Such underwater cables are certainly of considerable interest to intelligence agencies, since a huge part of international communication travels through them. It could certainly be the case that a lot of the world's fiber optic cables are being tapped - and not only in countries where respective intelligence agencies are based.","The article discusses undersea fiber-optic cables in detail, focusing on their vulnerability to tapping by intelligence agencies.

While it does not directly mention 'cut sea cables', it addresses the implications of such cables being tapped and their significance in international telecommunications.

The central theme revolves around the challenges and methods of accessing data from these cables, making it relevant to the topic."

Washington, DC 20003",-,"2015-11-06","English","War on the Rocks","The recent New York Times article about the concerns that Russia might be prepared to cut the submarine cables carrying voice and data traffic between North America and Europe conveys the impression that this is new territory for the United States. It is, in fact, not, and as an earlier War on the Rocks article noted, it was something that the United States experienced at the hands of the Germans during World War I. But the United States has itself cut cables in wartime as a means of disrupting the ability of an enemy power to command and control its distant forces. It conducted these operations during the short Spanish-American war of 1898. These actions reflected careful and innovative thinking by naval officers about the strategic significance of a technology central to the global economy of the day.

Documents at the Naval History and Heritage Command website offer a window into the prewar planning and execution of the cable-cutting operations. In addition, a number of participants wrote first-person accounts that appeared in popular and professional journals. Lt. Cameron McRae Winslow, who commanded one of the small craft used to attack cables in the Battle at Punta de la Colorados, published his in The Century Magazine in November 1898. Also, Capt. Caspar F. Goodrich discussed his direction of the cable-cutting efforts of the auxiliary cruiser St. Louis in the United States Naval Institute’s Proceedings in 1900.

The first attacks occurred in the Philippines, as Commodore George Dewey prepared for his extended stay in Manila Bay following his defeat of the Spanish squadron there in May 1898. When the Spanish governor-general refused to grant Dewey the use of the submarine cable from Manila to Hong Kong, Dewey ordered the USS Zafiro to find and sever the cable. Doing so denied both powers rapid electrical communications with their home countries, but Dewey could remain in contact by sending the revenue cutter McCulloch the 600 or so nautical miles to Hong Kong with dispatches. Dewey subsequently ordered the severing of another cable from Manila to Capiz, which cut the rest of the island chain off from Manila.

The more dramatic attacks on the cables were in the Caribbean theater, where Spain was dependent upon other countries for its cable communications with the colonies of Puerto Rico and Cuba. Two cable connections served Puerto Rico, including one at the capital of San Juan. But Cuba’s connections were more important. On the north side of the island, Havana connected to Key West by cable, making it easy for the United States to silence that connection in Florida. On the south side, several cables linked Cuba’s ports together and connected Cuba to other islands in the West Indies. The critical node was the port of Cienfuegos. If the cables there could be cut, then Havana and the western part of the island would be cut off from Santiago in the east, and thus also cut off from Spain and the rest of the world. Cutting the cables would help to make the blockade more secure.

As Lt. Cameron McRae Winslow later recounted in his Century Magazine article, the initial strikes occurred on May 11. Raiding parties from the cruiser Marblehead and the gunboat Nashville, carried in steam cutters and oar-powered sailing launches, attempted to locate the cables near the Colorados Point lighthouse at the entrance to Cienfuegos. The raiders, a mix of sailors and Marines, brought wire-cutting pliers, axes, hacksaws, and hammers to work over the heavy shore end of the cables they would find. Meanwhile, the Marblehead and Nashville were to provide covering fire against dug-in infantry along the shoreline and attempt to destroy the hut on shore where the cable connected to the telegraph network. The crews lacked any real idea where the cables were located, and the extensive coral prevented easy dragging with grapples. After some effort, however, the crews raised the first heavy cable, which took 30 men to lift onto the steam launches. One of the launches nearly swamped when the cable caught on coral and prevented the vessel from riding the heavy waves. The crews dragged the cable into deeper water, where it took more than 30 minutes to hacksaw. The raiders had to come closer toward the shore to attack the second cable, and as the work carried on Spanish reinforcements arrived at the coast. Lt. Winslow, spotting a third cable almost by accident, decided to attack this smaller one as well, but by this time the boat crews were coming under sustained rifle fire from the Spanish Mausers. Some of the sailors and Marines returned fire, a running gun battle raging while the shells from the Marblehead and Nashville crashed into the rocky shore close enough to spray the crews with rock fragments. As the fighting had become intense, and because the third cable was not important, the raiders withdrew to safety. It is remarkable, in retrospect, that 51 of the 112 Congressional Medals of Honor awarded in the Spanish–American War went to participants in this attack.

Within days the Navy stepped up its attacks on the remaining cables. Capt. Caspar F. Goodrich, who commanded the auxiliary cruiser St. Louis, later recounted in his article for Proceedings a conversation aboard the converted warship among his officers about how to make their ship more useful in the war effort. They settled on attacking cables, something that they had not done before. On May 13, the ship dragged up the cable between Puerto Rico and St. Thomas and cut it. Five days later, the St. Louis with the assistance of the Wompatuck attacked the cables off Santiago de Cuba that connected to Jamaica, while exchanging fire with the Spanish batteries around Morro Castle. They could not find the cables connecting Santiago to Cienfuegos. Goodrich recalled:

> We made altogether in the St. Louis and Suwanee no less than fourteen drives for them at points varying from just outside the harbor mouth at Santiago to ten miles distant but we never succeeded in getting the wire or bringing up anything more than the grapnel itself with its prongs straightened out like the ribs of an inverted umbrella. The Santiago-Cienfuegos cables were our conspicuous failure.

The last attacks occurred on July 7, when the St. Louis attacked three more cables in Guantanamo Bay that connected Cuba to Haiti and Puerto Rico. The auxiliary cruiser Yankee and the cruiser Marblehead provided covering fire against both shore batteries and two Spanish gunboats determined to score some successes against the attacking Americans.

The efforts by the United States to cut Spain off from all contact with her colonies was not simply a spur of the moment action by clever officers. U.S. officials had considered these moves before the war. These wartime actions would provide important precedents and lessons about the rights and responsibilities of belligerents and neutrals over submarine cables in the future. Several of the cut cables belonged to British and French companies, not the Spanish. But the value of these cables negated their presumably neutral status. Not surprisingly, the British government would accept that cutting a neutral’s cable could be a proper military measure in wartime — a right that Britain herself would want, and would use, as a belligerent in the future. The strategic importance of cutting an opponent off from the rest of the world would be one of the important lessons drawn from the war, as Capt. George O. Squier of the U.S. Army Signal Corps would describe in an article for National Geographic magazine in 1901. Cables owned and operated by the enemy would become not only targets but valuable war prizes to be kept by the winner after a war. And, dependence upon a neutral’s cable network could become a vulnerability — in the eyes of some officers, the United States would only be safe if its own cable connections to places like the newly acquired Philippines were in U.S. hands. Such precedents and lessons continue to inform thinking about the security of international communications today.

Russian submarines and spy ships have been observed in the North Sea, in waters near Northeast Asia, and even in locations closer to American shores such as off the coast of Cuba.

The fiber optic cables are crucial for American communication with allies as well as the flow of global commerce. More than 95 percent of daily communications are transmitted via these undersea cables, and financial institutions finalize transactions on them every second, amounting to more than $10 trillion in business every day.

The cables are commonly severed due to natural disasters and dragging anchors, but this generally occurs near landing points on shore, making the damage easy to repair quickly. Russian vessels appear to be scouting cable locations at significant depths where any damage would be difficult to locate and fix. Pentagon officials are also worried that Russia might be seeking secret cables in undisclosed locations that are used for United States military operations.

It is also possible to tap into undersea cables and acquire the information that is flowing through them. Intelligence officials indicated that the United States Navy submarine _Jimmy Carter_ is capable of doing just that.

The Russian ship Yantar was observed last month conducting operations near the American naval base in Guantánamo Bay, where a major communications cable lands. Navy officials reported that Yantar carries two deep-sea submersibles that can descend miles into the sea to cut cables.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The presence of Russian submarines and spy ships near undersea cables carrying most global Internet communications has U.S. officials concerned that Russia could be planning to sever the lines in periods of conflict, the New York Times reported on Sunday.  

The Times said there was no evidence of cable cutting but that the concerns reflected increased wariness among U.S. and allied officials over growing Russian military activity around the world.  

The newspaper quoted naval commanders and intelligence officials as saying they were monitoring significantly greater Russian activity along the cables' known routes from the North Sea to Northeast Asia and waters closer to the United States.

Naval officials said the ship and the submersible craft were capable of cutting cables miles (km) deep beneath the sea, the Times said.  

While cables are frequently cut by ship anchors or natural disasters and then quickly repaired, Pentagon officials are concerned that the Russians seem to be looking for vulnerabilities at much greater depths where cable breaks are harder to locate and repair, the paper said.

"A Fiber-Optic Silk Road","Discusses vulnerabilities of underwater fiber optic cables with hundreds of disruptions yearly due to anchor drags, emphasizing their importance in global connectivity.","https://thediplomat.com/2015/04/a-fiber-optic-silk-road","2015-04-02T00:00:00.000Z","Nadège Rolland",Yes,"Nadège Rolland","Arlington, Virginia, USA","100000","2015-04-02","English","Diplomat Media Inc.","**A Fiber-Optic Silk Road**

Not even two years into what will be a ten-year tenure at China’s helm, Xi Jinping has already made his mark on China’s foreign policy, in particular with the launch of the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, also known as the New Silk Road. This initiative will manifest in a vast network of transportation, energy and communication projects, all of which are supposed to boost intraregional trade and ultimately give China and its neighbors a sense of “common destiny.”

Although not as well publicized, the planned improvements in telecommunications infrastructure are as critical to business and economic development as the railroad projects that are to be technically and financially supported by China through its New Silk Road initiative. The virtual cloud of cyberspace relies on a physical infrastructure that constitutes the sinews of the Internet. Because cables can be laid easily along rail lines, the future Eurasian fiber optic backbones will benefit from the transportation infrastructure that will soon stretch along the Silk Road. For landlocked countries such as the Central Asian Republics, this will mean greater access to international data networks, at a cost averaging a tenth that of satellite communications and with a bandwidth significantly enhanced by fiber optic technology.

A number of projects are already underway. In 2006 the telecom giant ZTE was commissioned by Afghanistan to establish the country’s first fiber optic cable network, the same year that Huawei, another Chinese firm, received a contract from the government of Tajikistan. China and Russia have also partnered in building major terrestrial telecommunication links across the Eurasian continent, including the world’s longest terrestrial cable link, the Trans-Europe Asia (TEA), in addition to the Europe-Russia-Mongolia-China network, the TransEurasian Information Superhighway (TASIM), and the Diverse Route for European and Asian Markets (DREAM). The last of these is an ambitious Eurasian fiber optic communication land line whose launch was announced by Russia’s MegaFon in October 2013; it will be built with equipment supplied by China’s Huawei.

While domestic networks are mostly terrestrial, underwater fiber optic cables carry the vast majority of international data traffic. Thus Asia and Europe are currently digitally connected, via the Suez Canal thanks, among other things, to the world’s longest submarine cable, the 39,000 km SEA-ME- WE 3 system. Digital packets transmitted from Western Europe to Japan either have to traverse Europe, the Middle East, the Indian Ocean and the China Seas, or ride through the Atlantic, the U.S., and then the Pacific Ocean. The global undersea system experiences several hundred disruptions per year, especially at heavily trafficked choke points such as the Strait of Malacca or the Suez Canal, where too many cables pass through a narrow maritime passage. Regular disruptions occur when ships drag their anchors across cables lying on the ocean floor. In addition to increasing the connectivity of landlocked countries that stretch along the Silk Road, the envisioned terrestrial trans-Eurasian networks will alleviate the possible risks of disruption to maritime cables and add redundancy: Terrestrial cables also face disruptions, but they are easier to repair and maintain than the ones that lie 8,000 meters underwater.

The land digital highways will also increase the speed of data exchanges between Europe and Asia, a major challenge that telecommunication companies are racing to meet. Investors are willing to spend several hundreds of millions of dollars to gain a few milliseconds in highly profitable “high frequency trading” – a system where computers buy and sell automatically and electronically. By some estimates, a one millisecond advantage could be worth up to $100 million a year for hedge fund companies. Shorter routes are therefore the key to speed – and profit. The melting of the Arctic ice cap has created the possibility of opening new routes linking Asia to Europe and Trans-Arctic Ocean submarine cables are now being installed, with the aim of reducing by 30 percent the time a packet takes to travel from Tokyo to London. But maintaining the cables remains an obvious challenge and the Silk Road routes offer a sound alternative for customers looking for increased speed and reliability.

In addition to commercial motivations, the new fiber optic Silk Road could also have geopolitical and strategic implications. Russia and China evidently share a desire to shield themselves from U.S. and other Western intelligence agencies and probably believe that their own communications – both with one another and to and from Europe – will be better protected if cables run across their own territory rather than through the Indian Ocean or the U.S. The same motivation explains the announced Telebras cable, which will connect Brazil to Portugal without any U.S. technology, and the BRICS cable project, which will link Vladivostok to Brazil, via China, India and South Africa. There is a growing wariness among these countries that when their data traffic goes through hubs in Europe or the U.S., it incurs a greater “risk of potential interception of critical financial and security information by non-BRICS entities,” according to Andrew Mthembu, a South African businessman who is promoting the BRICS cable.

Together with planned roads, rail and pipelines, the fiber optic “Silk Road” will tie the Central Asian states more closely to China and Russia. These countries may also hope that the new cables will circumvent NSA attempts to eavesdrop on the data sent through U.S. IT companies. But they may well find themselves subjected to increased electronic surveillance by Beijing or Moscow, or both. Russia and China’s perceived security risks, reinforced by Edward Snowden’s revelations about the electronic surveillance carried out by the U.S. government through digital channels, will lead to more alternative routes provided by non-American companies, conceivably making it easier to seal off the global network if deemed necessary. Paradoxically, the emergence of alternative networks could eventually increase the digital balkanization of some parts of the world.

The hi-tech ship, launched in May of this year, was designed by Almaz Central Marine Design Bureau in St. Petersburg and crossed the Atlantic in August, sailing past the Turks and Caicos Islands on 1 September, briefly stopping at Havana port on 4 September, then continued along the Cuban coast. In doing so, Yantar ruffled feathers at the Pentagon, passing close by / over the landing spot of an important communications cable connecting the American naval station at Guantanamo Bay to the US.

The Yantar’s movements have drawn comments from US officials who have been worried for months about the increase in tempo of Russian naval activities, particularly submarine activity near important cable exchanges. One European diplomatic source recently described the intensity of Russian submarine patrols as having risen by 50% in the past year and are “now at a level comparable to that of the Cold War.”

The Yantar, with two remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) capable of carrying out deep sea operations has cable surveying and cutting potential. According to the New York Times, “Cables carry global business worth more than $10 trillion a day, including from financial institutions that settle transactions on them every second. Any significant disruption would cut the flow of capital. The cables also carry more than 95 percent of daily communications.” The severance of a single major cable could cause billions of dollars of financial damage and majorly disrupt a wide range of communications.

Whilst it is common for cables to be damaged and severed by ship anchors, storms and natural disasters, breakages usually occur a few miles offshore and can be repaired in a few days. What particularly worries the Pentagon is that Russia appears to be probing for weaknesses in cable systems at much greater depths, a long way from shore, where a severance would be very difficult to repair. MarineTraffic data on the Yantar’s return transatlantic voyage shows the vessel spent nine days surveying a patch of the Atlantic over 1000km east of Grenada with depths ranging from around 2000m – 4000m.

The United States is of course no stranger to subsea cable operations and tapping. In 1971 the US Navy carried out Operation ‘Ivy Bells’ during which a modified submarine, the USS Halibut was sent into the Sea of Okhotsk acting on intelligence received about a Soviet communications cable. Divers working from the submarine found the cable and installed a 6m long device around the cable pipe that recorded all communications travelling through it. Today the USS Jimmy Carter is believed to carry out a great deal of undersea intelligence gathering.

Survey ships come in a range of shapes and sizes and carry out a wide scope of work. Discovery was delivered to the UK’s National Environment Research Council (NERC) in July 2013 and has since completed nine scientific research voyages. At the time of writing, Discovery was south of the Canary Islands, destined for the Bahamas on a Rapid Climate Change Programme (RAPID) mission where it will collect data from NERC moorings in the Atlantic.

Survey ships also play a commercial role, with operators such as Dutch company Fugro running vessels which carry out surveys on behalf of energy companies. Advanced technology carried on-board survey ships includes multi-beam echo-sounders and sub-bottom profiler systems, enabling seismic surveys to be conducted. Visual representations of the sea floor and what lies beneath it can be created from data collected by seismic surveys. These in turn help geologists predict the location of hydrocarbons and direct exploratory drilling.

A detailed picture of the ocean floor can be of critical importance when working out the parameters and method for a search operation. For this reason, in June 2014 Fugro was awarded a contract by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) as part of the search for missing flight MH370. Advanced survey vessel Fugro Equator began mapping over 200,000 square kilometres of uncharted Southern Indian Ocean seabed using state-of-the-art multibeam echosounder equipment. The resulting bathymetric maps enabled a defined search for the missing aircraft to begin. In October 2014 Fugro Discovery commenced deepwater search operations, equipped with side scan sonar, underwater video and aviation fuel detection sensors.","The article discusses the activities of the Russian Navy’s survey ship Yantar, particularly its proximity to important undersea communication cables.

The mission, code-named “Ivy Bells” was so secret that a majority of the submarine’s sailors had no idea what they had accomplished. The success led to a concealed world of cable tapping.

And a decade ago, the United States Navy launched the submarine Jimmy Carter, which intelligence analysts say is able to tap undersea cables and eavesdrop on communications flowing through them.

But now the same ghost haunts America as Russian submarines and spy ships are aggressively operating near the vital undersea cables that carry almost all global Internet communications, raising concerns among American military and intelligence officials that Russians might be planning to attack those lines in times of tension or conflict.

This fact has caused growing wariness among senior American and allied military and intelligence officials over the accelerated activity by Russian armed forces around the globe. At the same time, the internal debate in Washington illustrates how the United States is increasingly viewing every Russian move through a lens of deep distrust, reminiscent of relations during the Cold War.

Amid concerns of cybersecurity and cyberwarfare, there is a related security topic that receives far less attention: vulnerabilities of the physical cables that enable telecommunications traffic and the Internet. Journalist Kate Murphy has a good, brief, non-technical analysis of the problem in today’s NYT, ""[The Cyberthreat Under the Street](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/sunday-review/the-cyberthreat-under-the-street.html?_r=0)""(NYT, Sunday Review, November 8, 2015).

Murphy reports that within the last year there have been sixteen “so-called fiber cuts in the San Francisco Bay Area … someone or some group has been going through manholes to sever fiber optic cables that supply telecommunications to the region.” Ominously, following each incident, affected residents “couldn’t make land or mobile calls, not even to 911, or send texts or emails.” The problem, Murphy says, is that when we talk about the Internet, we talk about clouds and ether. But the Internet is not amorphous. You may access it wirelessly, but ultimately you’re relying on a bunch of physical cables that are vulnerable to attack. It’s something that’s been largely forgotten in the lather over cybersecurity. The threat is not only malicious code flowing through the pipes but also, and perhaps more critically, the pipes themselves.

These physical cables have particular points of vulnerability - the “throughways and junctures” that handle vast quantities of Internet traffic - think by analogy of major freeway interchanges and what would happen to traffic in all directions if those junctures were brought down. Murphy reports that there isn’t even a good map of the Internet’s highways and byways, one that would show “locations that, if taken out, would severely hamper the system.” The most important points for possible disruption are the “Internet exchange points,” or I.X.P.s, where the “networks come together” to trade traffic; a handful of vital I.X.P.s, Murphy says, are located in major US metropolitan areas, carrying domestic as well as international traffic. If these major hubs were “taken out by natural disaster … or a strategic attack, much of the United States, if not much of the world, would have hindered Internet access or none at all, depending on the severity and sophistication of the strike.” Remarkably many I.X.P.s are housed in old, unprotected buildings … Often it’s possible to lease adjacent office space in the buildings. Sometimes there aren’t even security guards in the lobby. And the manholes around the buildings are also unprotected … The Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for critical infrastructure, has no requirements for the physical protection of I.X.P.s nor does it have any rules against ownership by companies affiliated with a hostile foreign state.

Experts interviewed by Murphy point to two different strategies for protecting this infrastructure. One is to increase security at the critical junctures, perhaps even concentrating traffic within those specially protected sites. The other is to disperse the system far more than it is now, so that no single juncture is as critical as now and the system is protected through redundancy. If you create redundancy, says Bill Woodcock of the research institute [Packet Clearing House](https://www.pch.net/), it “doesn’t matter if it’s in a mop closet.” He refers, Murphy says, to one “heavily trafficked I.X.P. in a former janitor’s closet on an upper floor of an old building.”","The article discusses the vulnerabilities of physical cables critical for telecommunications, including instances of fiber cuts that disrupt internet connectivity.

A story in the New York Times this week has started a conversation about the vulnerability of these cables and consequently, the Internet itself.

The Times reported that the Pentagon is increasingly concerned about Russian naval activity in proximity to key cables. The suggestion is that the Web could be crippled by Russian attack in the event of a confrontation with the West.

“We depend pretty extensively on these cables,” says Jon Hjembo. “In fact, pretty much everything that we do, all of our communications, eventually traverses fiber optic cables at some point. We talk a lot about the cloud, for example, but really the cloud is under the ocean, it’s under the ground. It’s not something nebulous in the sky. Even our wireless communications — the wireless connection is really a connection between your phone and a base station. From there it traverses fiber optic cables.”

There are about 300 undersea cables around the world, and they’re only about the width of a garden hose. So they are often broken by anchor cables, trawlers, and undersea disasters like earthquakes and landslides. Even shark bites. Many of the cables converge on certain hubs — like New York, Miami and Los Angeles — making these nodes especially vulnerable.

“There are at least 100 breaks on these systems every year,” says Hjembo. “But the beauty of networks is that there is a lot of built-in redundancy. So usually when a break occurs, we don’t even feel it.”

So any deliberate hostile attempt to sabotage the cable network would have to be pretty widespread to overwhelm all that built-in redundancy. “It would have to be a concerted attack on multiple systems at the same time,” says Hjembo.

That makes Hjembo skeptical about the probability of such a move. “If we saw any kind of movement towards multiple systems at the same time, I’m sure that an interception would occur before anything were to happen.”

He also points out that an attack on the Internet would in some ways be self-defeating, since the attacker would also suffer from the resultant chaos.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, referring to them as ""the arteries of the Internet"" and elaborating on their vulnerability to various threats, including natural disasters and human activities.

**Published Date:** 11/19/2024  

European officials are looking toward Russia after two submarine internet cables in the Baltic Sea were suddenly disrupted in an apparent sabotage operation, just weeks after the United States warned that Moscow was likely to target critical undersea infrastructure.

A cable between Lithuania and Sweden was cut on Sunday, according to Telia Lithuania, the telecommunications company that runs the link. Separately, the state-controlled Finnish telecoms company Cinia said one of its cables, which connects Finland and Germany, was disrupted on Monday.

The Swedish Prosecution Authority said Tuesday that the country’s National Unit against International and Organized Crime had opened a preliminary investigation into suspected sabotage over the cut cables. Finland’s National Bureau of Investigation also said it had launched an investigation.

While the exact causes of the incidents are still being investigated, Germany’s Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said he believed it was likely sabotage.

”Nobody believes that these cables were accidentally severed,” he told reporters on Tuesday morning ahead of a ministerial meeting in Brussels, Belgium. “We have to know that, without knowing specifically who it came from, that it is a hybrid action and we also have to assume that, without knowing by whom yet, that this is sabotage,“ Pistorius said.

His comments came after the foreign ministers of Finland and Germany said in a joint statement on Monday evening that they were “deeply concerned” about the severed cable between their nations, and raised the possibility of the incident being part of a “hybrid warfare.”

“The fact that such an incident immediately raises suspicions of intentional damage speaks volumes about the volatility of our times. A thorough investigation is underway,” the statement continued. “Our European security is not only under threat from Russia‘s war of aggression against Ukraine, but also from hybrid warfare by malicious actors.”

However, two US officials familiar with an initial assessment told CNN Tuesday that as yet there were “no indications of nefarious activity, nor intentional damage to seafloor infrastructure” and suggested the disruption was likely caused by an anchor dragged from a passing vessel.

Tracking data from Kpler and Spire did not show any ships near the area where the cables are believed to have been cut. All vessels above a certain tonnage are required by international law to have automatic identification systems that allow them to be tracked, and must keep them on at all times.

There are some instances where these might be turned off, and military ships are not required to have it turned on. Vessels that have it turned off are frequently involved in illicit operations such as oil smuggling and illegal fishing.

However, ship tracking data analyzed by CNN shows at least one ship crossing the Lithuania-Sweden cable.

The cutting of the cables on Sunday and Monday fits the pattern of attacks that have been linked to Russia. Additionally, it is no secret that Russia has been showing increased interest in undersea cables in recent months, patrolling close to critical maritime infrastructure often far from its shores.

Two US officials told CNN in September that the United States believed Russia was now more likely to carry out potential sabotage operations.

They said Moscow has been beefing up its dedicated secretive marine unit that deploys fleets of surface ships, submarines and naval drones to survey the seabed.

Known as “GUGI,” the Russian acronym for the “General Staff Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research,” the unit was previously spotted lurking around critical infrastructure.

A joint investigation by the public broadcasters of Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland found in April 2023 that Russia had deployed a fleet of suspected spy ships in Nordic waters as part of a program of potential sabotage of underwater cables and wind farms in the region.

European security officials and experts have been warning for months that Russia was waging a hybrid war against the West – accusations prompted by a series of seemingly random arson attacks, hackings and explosions that occurred across multiple European cities in recent months.

These included arson attacks against a bus garage in the Czech capital of Prague, the Museum of Occupation in Riga, Latvia, a warehouse of a Ukrainian company in London and a shopping center in Warsaw, Poland. Multiple hacking attacks and spying incidents have also been reported in different European countries. As the same time, the European Union has accused Russia and Belarus of weaponizing migration by pushing asylum seekers from third countries to its borders.

Rod Thornton, a senior lecturer in defense studies at King’s College London, said that Moscow has been using sabotage as an alternative to a full-on war with NATO, which would be disastrous for Russia.

Instead, Russia is trying to cause disruption without crossing the threshold that would trigger a forceful response from NATO. The principle that an attack against one member country is an attack against the whole alliance is the cornerstone of the group’s defense pact.

Thornton said it was telling that the disruption happened at the time Russia is trying to increase pressure on Ukraine and the West.

“It could be seen as Russia ramping up the war and the effects of the war in Ukraine before (US President-elect Donald) Trump comes into power to increase the willingness of Western powers to bring an end to the war,” he told CNN in an interview.

“You can see how Trump wants to bring an end to the war, and if the Russians increase pressure on other Western countries and show them the effects of the war, then those Western countries might be more amenable to supporting Trump in his desire to have a ceasefire,” he explained.

Nobody has so far claimed responsibility for the damage. If Russia was behind it, it is unlikely to admit so.

All of the sabotage attacks that have been linked to Russia earlier this year had one thing in common: they were done in a way that allowed Moscow to deny any involvement, usually by low-level operatives or common criminals paid to conduct them.

“This is important because international institutions like the UN can’t blame Russia because the evidence isn’t there. The circumstantial evidence is there, but not the real evidence, there’s no actual kind of smoking gun that can be linked back to them,” Thornton said.

Oleksandr V. Danylyuk, an associate fellow at Royal United Services Institute, a UK defense and security think tank, and a former Ukrainian defense and foreign intelligence official, said this kind of deniability has long been Russia’s strategy.

“The idea is to conduct the operation in the way that everybody understands that it was done by Russia, but at the same time, it leaves some room for the victim to pretend they didn’t know, because the victim is not interested in escalation,” he said, also pointing to the events leading to the annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea by Russia in 2014.

“Those little green men, everybody knew that they were Russian forces, but because the West wasn’t ready to do anything, they could say ‘oh, it’s not certain, we should check what’s going on, maybe it’s some kind of local militia,’” he said.

The extent of the disruption, if any, caused by the damage to the cables is unclear. Accidents that cause damage to undersea cables are rare, but they do happen, so most providers run services through several different routes to avoid blackouts.

The limited disruption could have been intentional, making the impact serious enough to be seen as an escalation, but not enough to spiral out of control, for now.

“It does take it that that one stage further, but it’s cutting a cable that isn’t going to offend too many countries. They could have gone to the Atlantic and cut a cable there between the US and the UK, or between Europe and the US, which could have major, major consequences, so this is a kind of warning shot,” Thornton said.

Cinia said in a statement that services running through the C-Lion1 cable that connects Helsinki with Rostock were down, but added that Finland’s international telecommunication connections were routed via multiple links.

The company said a repair vessel had been dispatched to the scene and, while it did not yet know how long it would take to fix the issue, added that it typically takes between five and 15 days for submarine cables to be repaired.

Telia Lithuania’s chief technology officer Andrius Šemeškevičius was quoted by Lithuanian media as saying that the cable that was disrupted – BCS East-West – handled roughly a third of Lithuania’s internet capacity. He added that traffic has been restored since the disruption.

CNN’s Stephanie Halasz, Billy Stockwell, Paul P. Murphy and Jim Sciutto contributed reporting.","The article titled 'European officials cry sabotage after two internet cables are cut in the Baltic Sea' from CNN directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables.

But that’s exactly what unnamed Pentagon officials say they worry could be in the works, according to a New York Times article published last week.

""The ultimate Russian hack on the United States could involve severing the fiber-optic cables at some of their hardest-to-access locations to halt the instant communications on which the West’s governments, economies, and citizens have grown dependent,"" the Times reported.

Experts, however, say that scenario is highly unlikely. While secret undersea cables used by the military might be at risk, the dozens of commercial cables beneath the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans ensure an alternate route in case one or two break.

""Cutting one or two [submarine cables] is not a big deal, really,"" said Alan Mauldin, director of research at TeleGeography, a Washington telecommunications consulting firm. ""Also bear in mind a lot of content is hosted in the US in massive data centers, so even if all the trans-Atlantic cables were cut, you’d still be able to use Facebook – it might be a bit more challenging for your friends in Europe to like the photos of your baby.""

Still, a network of fiber-optic cables does crisscross the world’s oceans, connecting countries and continents. Each cable is about three inches thick. At its center are several fiber-optic fibers that transmit data as pulses of red light. Submarine cables carry around 99 percent of transoceanic communications, according to Mauldin.

That means 99 percent of telephone and Internet data that crosses an ocean – from Europe to the US, from Canada to Asia, from Iceland or Australia to anywhere else – travels through a thin strand of optical fiber bundled into a cable and laid across the ocean floor.

Dozens of commercial cables cross the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, connecting the Americas to the rest of the world. Their locations are well-known. The telecom market research firm TeleGeography publishes an interactive map every year, and submarine cable locations are also marked on nautical charts. The cables also tend to follow long-established routes dictated by international agreements and undersea conditions.

Thanks to Edward Snowden, we know that the US and Britain tap those cables extensively. The practices date back to at least the 1970s, when a US submarine tapped a military submarine cable off the Russian coast. The US even has a submarine, the USS Jimmy Carter, that reportedly specializes in tapping undersea cables.

Sabotage is also common, according to a recent blog post by Doug Madory, director of Internet Analysis at Dyn, a company that monitors Internet performance. ""Unfortunately, accidental submarine cable cuts, along with acts of telecom sabotage, occur with varying degrees of regularity,"" Mr. Madory wrote. ""In either case, service is generally restored in hours, days or weeks and life carries on.""

The Egyptian Navy caught divers cutting a submarine cable near Alexandria in 2013. A submarine cable off the coast of Gabon, in West Africa, suffered the same fate earlier this year. There was even a string of sabotage to terrestrial fiber optic cables in the Bay Area that drew attention from the FBI.

The biggest danger to submarine cables, however, is also the most mundane: Ship anchors are responsible for the majority of cable breaks. Natural disasters like typhoons and earthquakes can even damage submarine cables. Then there are accidents. In 2011, a 75-year-old woman in Georgia took all of Armenia and parts of Georgia offline when she accidentally clipped a terrestrial fiber-optic cable while scavenging for copper.

Many of those incidents were incredibly disruptive, knocking out bandwidth for entire regions of the globe. But the sheer number of cables connecting the US to the rest of the world means that traffic can easily reroute around minor breaks to trans-Atlantic or trans-Pacific cables, according to Mr. Mauldin.

Major damage to trans-Atlantic cables would be most disruptive to the financial sector, which has grown to depend on quick global communications, according to Madory. The Internet would route around the damage quickly, and some of the difference could be made up with satellite links, Madory wrote.

That was the case when Hurricane Sandy took major networks hubs offline in 2012, according to an analysis of network traffic by Dyn. While the storm took down some websites hosted in flooded Manhattan data centers, the overall effect on global Internet traffic was negligible.

Rerouting traffic and switching to satellites couldn’t replace the lost bandwidth from a major submarine cable sabotage, according to Madory. Still, he agreed with Mauldin that a scenario where someone cuts enough submarine cables to significantly degrade US Internet access seems impractical.

""It would truly take a Hollywood scenario to even temporarily degrade the Internet for a country as richly connected as the United States,"" Madory wrote. ""Short of massive solar flares or some other civilization threatening global calamity, the Internet will continue to function as designed and with only sporadic localized failures.""

Those localized failures can pose major problems, especially in an emergency. The US government also has its own secret submarine cables that carry military data, according to the Times. Russia could be searching for their location, the Times said, citing unnamed US officials. Those classified cables could be at greater risk than commercial cables if there are fewer of them because there would be fewer alternate routers if one or more are sabotaged.

But for now, experts say, the public Internet is safe.","The article discusses the risks associated with undersea cables, including direct mentions of 'undersea cables' and 'submarine cables'.

Strange though it may seem, the world is strung together like a gigantic submarine zither. Optical fiber pipes—the plucked strings of the Internet—carry our music, our chatter, our data across the globe.

One can understand why American defense officials might be worried then, that a Russian spy ship has been snooping around these wired routes. As a _New York Times_ article earlier this week suggested, one cannot rule out the possibility of a devastating attack against these vital lines—""the ultimate Russian hack on the United States,"" if you will. The Pentagon, for one, has certainly contemplated such a doomsday event.

Should the rest of us be concerned? I asked Doug Madory, director of Internet analysis at Dyn, which keeps close tabs on the performance of Internet infrastructure, for his thoughts. He maintains that these networks—though they suffer cable breaks somewhat regularly (especially in shallow, anchor-prone waters)—are phenomenally resilient. A concerted attack, however, might pose a bigger problem.

""If someone did sever cables in the most extreme Hollywood scenario,"" he said, ""any kind of international commerce or communications could be severely impacted."" Still the greatest impact, he suggested, might be psychological.

""It does sound a little James Bond,"" he added. ""But I guess that’s what the Navy is paid to defend against.""

Such telecom attacks have a precedent—if not yet at the scale imagined by the _Times_. A spate of mysterious cable cuts hit California this year. Saboteurs in Gabon recently sliced submarine wires amid a labor dispute. And the Egyptian Navy arrested divers who damaged undersea lines with explosives while apparently scavenging for scrap metal in 2013. Madory describes these events and others in a blog post of his own here.

I mulled these incidents and incursions while visiting AT&T’s global network operations center earlier this week. (More on that to come.)

In March 2018, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai proposed banning local communities from using the FCC’s Universal Service Fund to buy equipment from Huawei. In 2012, a House Intelligence Committee report argued in favor of barring Huawei from any U.S. mergers or acquisitions, arguing that it was an arm of the Chinese government and a threat to national security. The Trump administration is trying to persuade its allies to block Huawei from contracts to build 5G wireless networks, arguing that Huawei equipment might have built-in back doors that would allow the Chinese government to monitor others’ communications. Some allies are following the United States’ lead; others, including close allies such as Britain, are resisting.

However, 5G is not the only important communications network. In other parts of the world such as Latin America and Africa, Huawei is laying the submarine cables that carry most long-distance communications traffic. Other countries are more willing to work with Huawei because they know that the United States, too, has tapped into global cable networks.

**Huawei is building big parts of the world cable network**

On Sept. 4, the South Atlantic Inter Link (or SAIL, for short) went live, connecting Fortaleza, Brazil, to Kribi, Cameroon. This international submarine cable, which was buried just below the sea floor across the entire South Atlantic, is a new link in a network of cables that connect the globe and carry more than 95 percent of international communications traffic. SAIL was constructed by Huawei Marine and funded through a partnership with China Unicom, a state-owned Chinese telecommunications company.

Before SAIL went live, the only cable connecting South America with a continent other than North America was a semi-obsolete cable to Portugal laid in the late 1990s. In September, the South Atlantic Cable System (SACS), funded by Angolan firms and constructed by the Japanese company NEC, also entered service between Brazil and Africa. Three more cables are planned to connect Brazil directly to Spain, Angola and South Africa.

In the past, firms from the United States and Europe initiated and built such projects. But companies like Huawei are increasing their share of the international network. In addition to new connections in and around China, Huawei Marine has been laying cables and updating old systems on both coasts of Africa, throughout Latin America and in the Mediterranean.

For instance, in 2015, Huawei upgraded the West Africa Cable System (WACS), which runs along the entire western coast of Europe and Africa from Britain to South Africa. In 2012, it did the same for MedNautilus in the Mediterranean. Huawei is currently constructing the Pakistan and East Africa Connecting Europe (PEACE) cable, which will connect the three continents sometime after 2020.

This Huawei expansion concerns some U.S. allies. In 2017, Australia raised red flags over a proposed international cable project between Sydney and the Solomon Islands to its north, explicitly citing security concerns over Huawei’s involvement. The Australian government then funded the $78 million project itself.

**The response is more equivocal than the United States would like — because other countries don’t trust the United States, either**

International cables give governments an enormous opportunity to collect information from other governments, businesses and private citizens alike — because all communications must flow through them. In the 1970s, the United States began Operation Ivy Bells to spy on submarine cables laid by the Soviet Union. Examples of such espionage date back at least as far as World War I, with Britain intercepting German communications.

However, some countries are as worried about U.S. surveillance as they are about Chinese threats. In 2013, Edward Snowden revealed that the National Security Agency was collecting international communications traffic traveling through the United States using these cables. The leak suggested that it was risky for other countries to have cables built by U.S. firms that almost exclusively went through the United States.

After the leak, South American governments, especially Brazil’s, became increasingly concerned about depending on the United States to communicate with the rest of the world. In a 2014 address to the European Union, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff argued: “We have to respect privacy, human rights and the sovereignty of nations. We don’t want businesses to be spied upon.”

Five years later, Brazil and others are accomplishing this goal by splitting up their international connections among firms based in a variety of countries. While Chinese firms are working on SAIL, other connections are being built by companies such as France’s Alcatel. No two new cables are being built to the same country.

European and North American governments are worried that China might spy on their telecommunications traffic through imported technologies. But the Chinese-built submarine cables mean that international transmissions are already at risk and likely to become more vulnerable in the years ahead.

By taking advantage of the opportunity to tap into the world’s communications network, the U.S. government has damaged its ability to counter the expansion of Chinese and non-U.S. firms. Its current efforts to constrain Huawei and other Chinese firms in Europe do not address other countries’ lack of confidence in the proposed American alternatives.

China’s Huawei has had to battle suspicions and worries about the security of its networking equipment for many years, which most recently culminated in it being placed on a US blacklist by the Trump administration. Now, Huawei is officially bowing out of one line of business, by agreeing to sell off its undersea cable operations, and reportedly shrinking another, by reducing smartphone production orders with supplier Foxconn.

Huawei Marine Systems, in which Huawei holds a 51 percent stake, lays undersea fiber optic cables between continents in much the same way that Microsoft, Facebook, and Google have been doing. It was established in 2009 and has laid more than 50,000km of cable across 90 projects, according to its website. In recent times, however, the toxicity of Huawei’s reputation as an alleged Chinese spying facilitator has made it increasingly difficult for Huawei Marine Systems to win contracts, as the FT reports. That report cites Fergus Hanson from the International Cyber Policy Centre at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, who says “It’s becoming a more difficult environment when trying to negotiate deals to build cables because [Huawei] is so much in the spotlight.”

Hengtong Optic-Electric, another Chinese company, is buying Huawei’s share of the submarine cable operation, and it made the planned sale official in a filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The price of the transaction has not been publicized.

In other Huawei news, a report from the South China Morning Post indicates that Foxconn, leading production and assembly partner to many smartphone makers, “has stopped several production lines for Huawei phones in recent days as the Shenzhen company reduced orders for new phones.” This appears to be a direct response to Huawei’s placement on the Trump blacklist, which deprived the company of its Android license, effectively neutering Huawei’s European Android smartphone business until further notice.

The SCMP goes on to report that Foxconn had apparently been hiring new staff earlier in the year to help it cope with Huawei’s growing demand, and Huawei was indeed on a path to becoming the world’s biggest smartphone vendor by the end of 2019. Reaching that goal has now been substantially delayed by the US ban setback and may even become impossible, depending on how long Huawei’s enforced estrangement from Google and other US partners continues.","The article titled 'Huawei is selling off its undersea cable business' discusses Huawei's operations in the undersea cable sector, including the sale of its undersea cable business and the implications of this decision.

A story in the New York Times this week has started a conversation about the vulnerability of these cables and consequently, the Internet itself.

The Times reported that the Pentagon is increasingly concerned about Russian naval activity in proximity to key cables. The suggestion is that the Web could be crippled by Russian attack in the event of a confrontation with the West.

“We depend pretty extensively on these cables,” says Jon Hjembo. “In fact, pretty much everything that we do, all of our communications, eventually traverses fiber optic cables at some point. We talk a lot about the cloud, for example, but really the cloud is under the ocean, it’s under the ground. It’s not something nebulous in the sky. Even our wireless communications — the wireless connection is really a connection between your phone and a base station. From there it traverses fiber optic cables.”

There are about 300 undersea cables around the world, and they’re only about the width of a garden hose. So they are often broken by anchor cables, trawlers, and undersea disasters like earthquakes and landslides. Even shark bites. Many of the cables converge on certain hubs — like New York, Miami and Los Angeles — making these nodes especially vulnerable.

“There are at least 100 breaks on these systems every year,” says Hjembo. “But the beauty of networks is that there is a lot of built-in redundancy. So usually when a break occurs, we don’t even feel it.”

So any deliberate hostile attempt to sabotage the cable network would have to be pretty widespread to overwhelm all that built-in redundancy. “It would have to be a concerted attack on multiple systems at the same time,” says Hjembo.

That makes Hjembo skeptical about the probability of such a move. “If we saw any kind of movement towards multiple systems at the same time, I’m sure that an interception would occur before anything were to happen.”

He also points out that an attack on the Internet would in some ways be self-defeating, since the attacker would also suffer from the resultant chaos.","The article discusses the vulnerabilities of undersea fiber optic cables, directly addressing the topic of cut sea cables.

When Donald Trump effectively called for Russia to hack into Hillary Clinton's emails, the GOP nominee's remarks touched off a media firestorm. Here was a presidential candidate encouraging a foreign government to target American interests with cyberspying, which could expose national security information and undermine U.S. security infrastructure.

Cyberwarriors working for Moscow and other regimes are already probing our networks, so Trump's words were not particularly damaging. However, it serves as an opportunity to discuss state-sponsored hacking and remind that the U.S. is equally active in this domain.

The U.S. military employs submarines as underwater hacking platforms, which represent a crucial part of America's cyber strategy. They not only defend against digital attacks but also carry out cyberattacks. According to Rear Adm. Michael Jabaley, the U.S. Navy's program executive officer for submarines, there is a significant offensive capability that is highly prized.

Historically, the U.S. has used submarines to tap undersea communications cables off the Russian coast since the 1970s, recording messages between Soviet forces. The NSA continues this practice by monitoring underwater fiber cables as part of its intelligence-gathering efforts.

Modern U.S. submarines are equipped with advanced antennas to intercept and manipulate communications, especially on weak or unencrypted networks. Stewart Baker, former NSA general counsel, noted that cyberattacks are easier to execute than to defend against.

One notable submarine, the USS Annapolis, is part of a broader U.S. spying network disclosed during the Edward Snowden leaks, performing numerous ""computer network exploitations"" weekly.

The Navy aims to enhance its capabilities by turning submarines into motherships for underwater drones, allowing for closer maneuvers and operations while the submarines remain at a distance.

R. Miller and C. T. Rose contribute an article on this subject in the Engineering Supplement of Siemens Magazine (Oct.-Nov., 1942). In submarine cables, particular care has always to be exercised in dealing with the joints, and every endeavour is made to limit their number by manufacturing individual cable lengths as long as possible, consistent with the methods of transport, storage accommodation, etc., available, and the scheme of laying to be adopted.  
With submarine cable-laying under normal conditions, it is unlikely that more than one sea joint will be necessary, the cable being laid in two parts, one section from each shore termination. This necessitates cutting the cable at a convenient position, buoying the end, and picking up again after the other section has been laid. The joint is then made on the ship and on completion is cast overboard, after due precautions have been taken.  
The article refers to both communication cables and power cables, the latter for voltages, for example, up to 33 kV.

July 18, 2013  

Documents published last week by the Australian website Crikey revealed that the U.S. government compelled Telstra and Hong Kong-based PCCW to give it access to their undersea cables for spying on communications traffic entering and leaving the U.S.  

The significance of the disclosure is obvious; today, more than 99 percent of the world's internet and telephone traffic is now carried by undersea fiber optic cables.  

Since the late 1960s, as part of its ECHELON spy project, the United States has been tapping undersea cables to extract communications and signals intelligence.  

In fact, projects such as Operation Ivy Bells, a joint Navy-NSA secret intelligence program directed against the former Soviet Union, were designed to do just that.  

A year later, AT&T whistleblower Mark Klein told Wired Magazine that the NSA was tapping directly into the world's internet backbone.  

Whatever submarine operations the NSA still carries out with the U.S. Navy and ""Five Eyes"" surveillance partners, access to information flowing through undersea cables means that the U.S. government is well-positioned to scoop up virtually all global communications.  

Economic Espionage  
Reporting by Australian journalists confirm information published July 6 by The Washington Post, revealing that overseas submarine cable companies doing business in the United States must maintain an internal corporate cell of American citizens with government clearances.  

Access to undersea cable traffic by the FBI and any U.S. governmental authorities entitled to effect Electronic Surveillance is an explicit condition for doing business in the United States.  

Classified NSA maps provided by Snowden revealed the locations of dozens of U.S. and allied signals intelligence sites worldwide.  

The paper also reported that a new state-of-the-art data storage facility at HMAS Harman is currently under construction to support Australian intelligence agencies.  

We now know, based on documents provided by Snowden, that the infiltration of computer networks by U.S. secret state agencies is useful not only for military secrets and mass spying but also for economic and industrial espionage.  

By the end of the 1990s, the U.S. administration claimed that intelligence activity against foreign companies had gained the U.S. nearly $150 billion in exports.  

At the time the Telstra pact was signed, the Australian telecommunications and internet giant was 50.1% owned by the Australian government.  

This document illustrates the deep ties between U.S. intelligence and corporate interests, showcasing the ongoing surveillance and the implications for global communications and economic competition.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, focusing on their role in global communications and U.S. government surveillance.

When we talk about modern tech warfare, we’re usually focused on nuclear reactors, water pumps, or transportation systems. We might think of the super-virus deployed by the United States and Israel to slow down Iran’s nuclear program in 2010. We don’t typically consider the miles of undersea cables that, according to the US Federal Reserve, carry $10 trillion in transactions every day.

Now, the US government is concerned the Russian military could attempt to sabotage these cables in a time of conflict, according to the New York Times. The newspaper reported an uptick of activity by Russian submarines near several major cables.

Although internet cables close to shore tend to be bulky and well-armored, those that run along the deep sea are often much thinner, according to Nicole Starosielski, a communications professor at New York University and author of The Undersea Network. These cables, like the one we’ve illustrated above, are just a centimeter or two in diameter and protected only by an outer layer of insulation.

Cables are generally safest out in the deep sea, but it’s not uncommon for them to be accidentally damaged by fishing operations. “An undersea grapnel could easily cut a cable, as can an anchor,” Starosielski wrote in an email. “It happens all the time.”

“It wouldn’t be much trouble at all” for the Russian military to deliberately sabotage such a cable, Starosielski said.

Damage to cables that are close to shore can be fixed fairly quickly. Not so for broken lines in the middle of the ocean. ”Since ships have to cross the ocean before getting to the line, this unavoidably takes time,” Starosielski said.

Still, undersea cable damage and repair is a regular practice, and most internet traffic to and from the US can travel over multiple routes, avoiding any cables that have been disabled.

US government sources have revealed to the New York Times growing concerns that Russian naval vessels may be threatening the global internet infrastructure. Russian ships have been seen tracing out the routes of the trans-oceanic cables that carry the vast majority of the world's internet traffic around the world. Russian ships seem to be deliberately staying close enough to these cables to use their attached submersibles, which the US says could descend and sever the lines -- or perhaps tap them. The sheer number of ships involved has been described by senior diplomats as comparable to the Cold War.

The issue stems from the fact that these ships seem to be threatening these deep-sea cables in the deep sea, as opposed to near shore where the vast majority of natural or accidental damage occurs. A piece of the internet backbone, severed miles undersea, could potentially take weeks or months to find and repair. Analysts did say that the ships could be trying to find the location of secret cables laid down, mostly the US, for military or other private uses. Ships don't necessarily need to be anywhere near a deep sea cable to cut it, so in a way the cables are safest from Russian tampering while Russian ships still float directly above them.

On the other hand, take this piece of news in concert with another one from earlier in the month: Russia is running tests on the feasibility of cutting itself off from the global internet. In other words, Russia may be actively researching whether it can maintain certain modern abilities with a Russian-bloc intranet and only semi-permeable junctions of interaction with the outside world. With ships now seemingly looking into the possibility of creating such a reality, it's a troubling situation.

If this is indeed anything more than saber rattling, it could be intended to function in one or both of two ways: as a long-term cultural tactic, or as a short-term military one.

Vladimir Putin could be looking into the possibility of re-creating some version of the Iron Curtain (Silicon Curtain? Digital Curtain?) to cut his people off from outside influences. He's been very outspoken about what he calls the imperialism of the West in the former Soviet countries, both military and cultural. More to the point, it's difficult to maintain a narrative of victimhood when your citizens can readily consume the internal cultural offerings of a population that genuinely has no interest in conflict. Despite firewall and filtering efforts, Western European and US media are far more accessible to modern Russians than 30-40 years ago.

The problem with that plan, of course, is that in the modern world, connection is synonymous with success. At the extreme end of the path of censorship is North Korea, a country where radio transceivers come welded so they can only receive the government channel, and where it's thought millions may currently be starving. Russia has had trouble stabilizing its economy in recent years, so any move to further cut off the outside world will be risky. At the least, it forces the country to double down on old-world pillars like oil and gas, or good old fashioned goods production. Neither of those seem like safe bets in the short or long term.

Satellite internet may be expensive, but it could ease this worry.

On the other hand, you can be sure there are some American generals getting quite antsy at the prospect of a much more aggressive severing of the cables. Whether a purely malicious move meant to sow economic chaos, or a strategic prelude to some more direct military action, shutting down the global internet could be an incredibly powerful move. Just the possibility of such an attack might push the US and others to start looking longing to some recently proposed plans for global satellite internet.

Still, we're a long way from any sort of outright military move for World War Three -- which severing the internet backbone would be, given its importance. It's worth noting, though, that just running the ships along a certain route has made the US Navy sit up and take notice, and it's once again put Russia in the driver's seat in international affairs. The US has once again shifted into wait-and-react mode -- absolutely not the sort of place that the US likes to be.","The article discusses Russian naval activities near undersea cables, highlighting the potential threat to these cables and their importance for global internet connectivity.

But Moscow’s willingness to cut off civilian populations from the Internet — a tactic it has already used against regional political threats — may be cause for alarm.

The Times article quoted U.S. and European military and intelligence officials as saying they have observed a 50 percent increase in Russian naval patrols over the past year, including along critical points of the global Internet infrastructure — thousands of miles of fiber-optic cables, often sunk in hard-to-monitor depths of the ocean. Officials, speaking anonymously, told the Times that the increased submarine and spy ship activity has exacerbated concerns about underwater infrastructure being vulnerable to attack in the event of some future international conflict.

It would be “the ultimate Russian hack on the United States,” the officials said, halting “the instant communications on which the West’s governments, economies and citizens have grown dependent.”

Experts say the threat of such a far-reaching cut remains largely hypothetical, however. There have been cases where a country's sole access point was damaged — by a ship's anchor, for instance — but critical data infrastructure in the U.S. is designed to be highly resilient, with dozens of different pipelines and access points on its shores. In a globalized economy, it would also be difficult to target just one country; deliberately cutting off connectivity to a big financial center like the U.S. would send shockwaves across the globe.

Still, Russia watchers say Moscow has been testing its ability to disrupt Internet infrastructure on a more localized scale as part of its wider military spending spree since oil revenues spiked in 2007. “Yes, there is a program by Russians to do this,"" said Keir Giles, an expert on Eurasian security and director of the Conflict Studies Research Centre at the Chatham House think tank in London. “And yes, it has been intensified over the last decade along with every other Russian military activity.”

The most credible fear, at least for the U.S., is that Russia might try to interfere with the secret cables that carry classified data about American military and intelligence work across the globe, Giles said. Unlike most other undersea data cables, these are not mapped. That is why some officials suspect the recent Russian submarine exploration may be aimed, in part, at gathering intelligence on where these pipelines run. Many countries, including the U.S. and Russia, are capable of tapping these cables to steal information, but cutting them would go a step further. It could even force the U.S. to revert to less-secure channels of communication, potentially undermining the intelligence-sharing apparatus.

But for now, the greater vulnerability lies far from U.S. shores. In both Crimea and the Baltic Sea, Russia has tried to disrupt undersea cables at weak points in the infrastructure, according to an excerpt from a forthcoming Chatham House paper, “Russia's New Tools For Confronting The West.” Last year, Russian special forces “selectively disrupted cable connections” at Crimea’s Simferopol Internet exchange point — the only point of access on the peninsula — to shut residents off from anti-Russian media and other sources of politically sensitive information. Coupled with the ban on pro-Ukrainian television programming, the result was Russia’s “total information dominance of the region.”

While countries scale up their cyber-defenses, fearful that viruses and malware pose a growing threat to national security, the underwater cables that carry nearly all global Internet communications remain largely unprotected. In cases like Crimea, where a state can gain physical access to this infrastructure, “you don’t necessarily need sophisticated technology or a Stuxnet,” Giles said, referring to the cyber worm, allegedly created by U.S. and Israel, that struck Iran in 2010. “You just need a few guys with bolt cutters to open the door and a few guys with expertise to cut the cables. Hence the need for civilian infrastructure to be better protected.","The article titled 'Could Russia really cut the Internet?' directly discusses the potential for Russia to cut undersea data cables, describing it as a tactic that could cause significant damage to military and commercial interests.

It highlights increased Russian naval patrols near critical points of global internet infrastructure, emphasizing concerns about the vulnerability of underwater cables to attack.

The article cites experts who confirm that Russia has tested its ability to disrupt internet infrastructure, particularly in regions like Crimea, where cable connections were disrupted to control information flow.

The discussions on the implications of cutting these cables and the historical context provided indicate that the topic is central rather than a minor mention.

Recently a New York Times article on Russian submarine activity near undersea communications cables dredged up Cold War politics and generated widespread recognition of the submerged systems we all depend upon.

Not many people realize that undersea cables transport nearly 100% of transoceanic data traffic. These lines are laid on the very bottom of the ocean floor. They’re about as thick as a garden hose and carry the world’s internet, phone calls, and even TV transmissions between continents at the speed of light. A single cable can carry tens of terabits of information per second.

While researching my book, I realized that the cables we rely on remain largely unregulated and undefended. Although they are laid by only a few companies and often funneled along narrow paths, the ocean’s vastness has often provided them protection.

The biggest problem with cable systems is human error. Because they run underground, underwater, and between telephone poles, cable systems populate the same spaces we do. As a result, we accidentally break them all the time. Local construction projects dig up terrestrial lines, boaters drop anchors on cables, and submarines can pinpoint systems under the sea.

Most of the recent media coverage has been dominated by the question of vulnerability. Are global communications networks really at risk of disruption? The answer is not black and white. Any individual cable is always at risk but likely far more so from boaters and fishermen than any saboteur. Over history, the single largest cause of disruption has been people unintentionally dropping anchors and nets.

Sabotage has actually been rare in the history of undersea cables. The fact is it’s incredibly difficult to monitor these lines. Cable companies have been trying to do so for more than a century, but the ocean is too vast and the lines simply too long.

The thing that protects global information traffic is redundancy. When there is a break, information is automatically rerouted along other cables. Although individual companies look out for their own networks, there is no economic incentive or supervisory body to ensure the global system as a whole is resilient. If there’s a vulnerability to worry about, this is it.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, including their vulnerabilities to being cut or damaged.

Granted the distance that Russian submarines are maintaining, authorities in the US are worried that the global communication lines will be tapped into or severed in case conflict arises.

The US government has grown wary about Russia's increased naval activity near undersea fiber optic cables, which serve as highways for most of the instant communication and data services that citizens within the West have been dependent on. The danger that the current situation presents goes beyond that of the Cold War between the now dissolved Soviet Union and NATO along with its allies.

Moreover, given that the underwater cables carry 95 percent of daily global communications and commerce, having them cut in hard-to-access areas means paralyzing almost the whole world for a significant amount of time before it can be repaired.

""It would be a concern to hear any country was tampering with communication cables,"" said Navy spokesperson Cmdr. William Marks.

According to a Sunday report by the publication, there is yet to be evidence of the cables being cut or tampered with. Nonetheless, the whole situation causes the US to be suspicious and question Russia's increased military presence and activity throughout the globe.

""I'm worried every day about what the Russians may be doing,"" Rear Adm. Frederick J. Roegge said.

The New York Times also alleges that Russia's increased naval activity follow the known paths of the undersea cables, which are the veins of global commerce and electronics.

Furthermore, Yantar, a spy ship from Russia, which is rumored to be equipped with deep-water submersible crafts, was spotted as it travelled towards Cuba. Note that another underwater cable runs along the Cuban seas.

""The risk here is that any country could cause damage to the system and do it in a way that is completely covert, without having a warship with a cable-cutting equipment right in the area,"" Michael Sechrist, who used to be a manager for a project that the Department of Defense funded, explained.","The article discusses the proximity of Russian submarines to critical underwater cables, emphasizing concerns about potential tampering or severing of these cables.

"A New Cold War Deep Under the Sea?","Explores the critical role of undersea cables in global communications amid rising military threats, emphasizing the need for their protection against potential disruptions.","https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-cold-war-under-the-sea_b_8402020","2015-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","Admiral Jim Stavridis (Ret.)",Yes,"Admiral Jim Stavridis (Ret.)","New York City, U.S.",-,"2015-10-28","English","HuffPost","**A New Cold War Deep Under the Sea?**  
Virtually all of the world's information moves deep under the sea. Well over 95 percent of everything moving on the global Internet passes through 200 or so highly active cables, some as deep under water as Mount Everest is tall. On a normal day, that information is safe and sound, humming along the protected fiber optic strands upon which moves the information that is the backbone of the world's economy.

But recent reports by a variety of sources indicate renewed interest by Russian submarine forces in surveillance of those cables, including detailed monitoring and targeting of the system. The tactical reasons for doing so are plain: in the case of heightened tensions, access to the underwater cable system represents a rich trove of intelligence, a potential major disruption to an enemy's economy and a symbolic chest thump for the Russian Navy.

Placing the submarine activity in the larger context of Russian geopolitical strategy, it is possible to see the broader rationale for these moves at this moment. First, such actions play well to a domestic Russian audience that wants to see Russia as the global counter-weight to the U.S. Russian President Vladimir Putin above all else craves respect, and his actions -- from invading Georgia to annexing Crimea to muscling into Syria on the side of the reprehensible Assad regime to active surveillance -- enhance his international importance and profile.

The movement of information is the lifeblood of the global economic system: it needs to be more secure from accident and attack.

Second, these types of high tech, delicate and complex undersea maneuvers constitute important training and preparation for the Russian Navy. The ability to tap these cables for intelligence as well as attack them with precision is a skill-based activity that requires detailed knowledge and real precision work at depth according to many reports. Practice is vital.

Additionally, the underwater maneuvers are a signal to the U.S. and its allies, much like the other recent aggressive international moves coming from Moscow. Russia is reaching for many other Cold War tools as well, including aggressive long-range bomber patrols above NATO nations (particularly the Baltic states) and building up significant military capability in the Arctic.

Are we headed back to another Cold War? Probably not, despite the ominous range of activities. We should remember that we still cooperate with Russian on a wide range of activities: counter-piracy patrols off the Horn of Africa, counter-terrorism information sharing, counter-narcotic activity in Central Asia, support to Afghanistan and constructing the controversial but widely accepted counter-proliferation agreement with Iran. Unlike the Cold War, there are zones of U.S.-Russia cooperation today.

We should convene an international conversation about protecting the underwater fiber optic grid system, much as we do for air and sea lanes of communication.

The Cold War dwarfed in size and scope anything we see today. The war saw millions of soldiers facing each other across the Fulda Gap in central Europe; two immense battle fleets grappling with each other across the oceans of the world; and two massive nuclear arsenals on a hair-trigger alert, ready to launch within minutes. We are not remotely at that point today.

So what we should do in response to Russian behavior around the world, including reports of underwater cable surveillance? We must avoid stumbling backwards into a new Cold War. This means maintaining open lines of communication, searching for zones of cooperation where we can find them (from the Arctic to Arms Control) and taking a deep breath when we see provocations before we respond militarily. We should convene an international conversation (to include Russia of course) about protecting the underwater fiber optic grid system, much as we do for air and sea lanes of communication.

But we must also stand firmly behind established principles of international law: nations should not simply annex the territory of their neighbors, as was done in Ukraine; nor should they support brutal, lawless, illegal regimes like that of Assad in Syria. We should rally as much international support as we can muster to criticize such behavior, and when it is particularly egregious -- as in Ukraine -- impose sanctions.

Our naval forces need to be ready to defend our submarine cables, exactly as we defend our electrical grid, industrial base and transportation networks.

Another important component is operational. Our naval forces need to be ready to defend our submarine cables, exactly as we defend our electrical grid, industrial base and transportation networks. That means a robust, highly technical and capable undersea Navy. The U.S. leads the world in operations underwater, and we absolutely must maintain that edge. In this context, exercises and operations with key allies and friends to protect this shared and vital undersea infrastructure is a good signal to send to the Russians as well. NATO allies, Japan, Australia and many other friends have significant undersea capabilities: by practicing and operating together, we help create a stable and protected global communication grid.

Finally, we need to build more resiliency and redundancy into the underwater cable network. It is far too vulnerable to sabotage, especially at the terminals where the cables are in relatively shallow water. We need more ""dark cables"" that are not operational but kept in reserve. The movement of information is the lifeblood of the global economic system: it needs to be more secure from accident and attack.

Russia's robust Cold War-like moves should be concerning, but we should remember what a weak hand of cards Russia actually holds: a declining population, high rates of alcoholism and drug abuse, few real allies and an economy that is a one-trick pony. As Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has said with a bit of hyperbole, Russia is ""a large gas station masquerading as a country.""

Despite these fundamental weaknesses, under Putin, the Russians will reach for Cold War tools in an effort to prove their global relevance. It will not broadly succeed as a strategy, and we should not overreact. Instead, let's take sensible steps to maintain a dialog, cooperate where we can, confront where we must and protect our vital infrastructure and interests around the world -- including in the deepest parts of the sea.","The article discusses the significance of undersea cables and the potential threats posed by Russian military activities.

It may sound far-fetched at first, but there’s a growing fear of the damage a newly aggressive Russia might inflict in a time of tension or conflict simply by damaging or cutting the undersea cables that carry almost all of the West’s internet traffic.

The New York Times reported that Russian submarines and spy ships were aggressively operating near the vital undersea cables. Could they be preparing for a new form of warfare?

The perfect global cyber attack could involve severing the fibre-optic cables at some of their hardest-to-access locations in order to halt the instant communications on which the West’s governments, military, economies and citizens have grown dependent. Effectively this would cripple world commerce and communications, destabilise government business and introduce uncertainty into military operations. A significant volume of military data is routed via this internet backbone.

The fibre-optic cables that carry the majority of the globe’s internet traffic follow designated paths under the oceans. To cause world chaos, all that is needed is some “wire cutters” (realistically a submarine with a depth charge would do). This is not rocket science and there will be no need for clever hackers.

While there is no evidence yet of any “cable snipping”, there is concern among senior US and allied military and intelligence officials over the accelerated activity by Russian armed forces around the globe. At the same time, the internal debate in Washington illustrates how the US is viewing Russian moves with distrust. Surveillance activity shows a significant increase in Russian activity along the known routes of the cables and more than a dozen officials confirmed in broad terms that it had become the source of significant attention in the Pentagon.

**Information warfare**

Talking to the BBC’s Gordon Corera, the deputy director of the US National Security Agency (NSA), Richard Ledgett, warned of the increasing danger of destructive cyber-attacks by nation states in addition to criminal organisations. A concerted cyber-attack against another nation state can result in the breaking down of society and the loss in ability to defend itself. Information warfare (IW) is an extension of electronic warfare, but importantly it embraces cyber warfare.

More than 50% of effort in future conflicts will be in both cyberspace and electromagnetically in the ether – this will be known as “information warfare”. It will disrupt radio communications, radar and intelligence surveillance, military command and control, weapon systems control, aircraft navigation, national infrastructures, emergency services, and all internet communication. Severing internet backbone networks will cause major worldwide disruption causing widespread suffering without firing a single shot in anger.

In March 2003, allied forces led by the US began Operation Iraqi Freedom. In the first few days of that conflict an information war took place that completely neutralised the ability of Iraq to use the electromagnetic spectrum and the internet. Its armed forces and its civilian infrastructure was virtually paralysed. The conflict lasted just 43 days and Iraq had a formidable and well equipped military.

Russia has long realised that this “soft” warfare is the equal partner to the familiar hard-weapons side and is planning to spend billions perfecting techniques required. Cyberwarfare has become an important weapon in the military arsenal.

**Attack on Estonia**

In April 2007, denial of service (DoS) attacks targeted Estonian websites including the Estonian parliament, banks, ministries, newspapers and broadcasters, amid the country’s disagreement with Russia on the relocation of the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn (a Soviet war grave monument) together with Soviet war graves in Tallinn.

Cyber analysts concluded that the cyber-attack on Estonia was well planned and sophisticated with no precedent. Although Russia vehemently denied involvement the foundations for future IW were becoming established. Military strategists worldwide study the attack to for its inclusion into an order of battle, and to develop mitigating measures.

**Georgia was next**

Military and government strategists did not have to wait long for another example of information warfare. On July 20 2008, just prior to the Russian military invasion of Georgia to support the self-proclaimed republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, a massive Russian-based internet DoS attack against Georgia began. Targets for the DDOS attack included websites of the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, the OSInform news agency and OS radio station. It was also reported that key sections of Georgia’s internet traffic had been rerouted through servers based in Russia and Turkey, where the traffic was either blocked or diverted – effectively closing the internet in Georgia for the duration of hostilities.

There was also circumstantial evidence that the Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline control system was targeted by a sophisticated computer virus similar to Stuxnet which led to an uncontrolled pressure incident. The Russian government again distanced itself from any cyber involvement and blamed the Russian criminal fraternity. However, observers have acknowledged that the resources needed for this level of attack point to a nation state involvement.

**Ukraine as electronic war lab**

The escalating military conflict in Ukraine has featured a mirrored cyberwar between the two sides with DDOS and malware attacks against public websites, banks, radio and television channels and public utilities. At the same time Ukrainian forces have grappled with formidable Russian electronic warfare capabilities.

Russia has deployed its new multi-functional Krasukha-4 electronic warfare systems to support Ukrainian separatists and “volunteer” Russian combat troops. It is the Krasukha-4 that has been deployed to Syria. Russia has again denied any involvement in the Cyber-attack and blames criminal organisations. But this is the first time a fully integrated IW has been witnessed.

Lieutenant-General Ben Hodges, the commander of the US army in Europe, has described the Russian capability as “eye watering” and confirmed that US army personnel from NATO are working alongside their counterparts in the Ukrainian army to gain first-hand experience of information warfare from a state-based adversary.

Is Russia is developing the capability to repeat Operation Iraqi Freedom on a global scale? If its investment in information warfare is any measure we should be concerned – this investment in information warfare is not being matched by the US and Europe combined.

Western leaders should be made aware that we need to accelerate our development of information warfare capability and train more people to deal with it, but above all we should stop isolating Russia in the world and putting it in a position where it feels the need to cash in on this investment.","The article discusses the potential threat of Russian attacks on undersea cables, explicitly mentioning 'cutting the undersea cables' and 'severing the fibre-optic cables'.

Four senators sent a letter to three top Obama administration officials seeking information on ""what steps are being taken, and what steps need to be taken, in order to enhance the security of the undersea network"" of cables.

There are fewer than 300 fiber-optic submarine cables crisscrossing the world, connecting every continent except Antarctica. Most of the cables are approximately three inches in diameter and heavily insulated, though deeper sections of the cables are less protected. Despite being perhaps the most critical element of the global communications system, the cables go largely unnoticed by most of the world’s population.

“We are increasingly concerned with what a targeted attack on the cables the U.S. depends on could result in.”

But the Russian government recently spooked American officials by sending a submarine equipped to cut undersea cables down the East Coast of the United States. The move sparked fears that Russia could enhance a kinetic war with physical sabotage of the Internet’s central nervous system.

This concern motivated Sens. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), James Inhofe (R-Okla.), and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) to send their letter to Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, and Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson.

“Due to increased Russian aggression and their presence in waters these cables rest in, we are increasingly concerned with what a targeted attack on the cables the U.S. depends on could result in,” the senators wrote.

Sabotage isn’t the only concern. Natural disasters can also rupture the cables. Nine of them snapped during the 2006 Hengchun earthquake in Taiwan, and the massive 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami damaged a cable that connected Japan and the western United States.

Because of the interdependence of these cable systems, a rupture in one country can take down access to large parts of the Web in countries on the other side of the continent.

Although there is significant redundancy in the transatlantic cable system, underserved areas like the Middle East and Africa are vulnerable to massive disruptions from a single cable break. The Mediterranean and the Middle East suffered widespread service disruptions during three incidents in 2008 that remain unsolved. (One contested theory is that abandoned or improperly dropped anchors damaged the cables.)

The senators’ request for information about cable protection will likely meet with resistance from the military, which is typically reluctant to discuss the specifics of defensive measures. But the letter, which urged the creation of “a national security strategy that incorporates the vulnerability of our undersea network,” could spur action on Capitol Hill to formally adopt such a strategy.","The article discusses 'undersea Internet cables' and highlights concerns regarding their vulnerability, particularly in light of Russian military actions aimed at potentially cutting these cables.

Granite Island bills itself as “the internationally recognized leader in the field of Technical Surveillance Counter Measures (TSCM), Bug Sweeps, Wiretap Detection, Communications Security, Technical Counter-Intelligence, and Spy Hunting,” and Atkinson himself has a similarly elaborate profile description: “Student, Soldier, Spy Hunter, Scientist, Electronics Engineer, Computer Programmer, Cyberoperations, Computer and Digital Devices Forensics.”

Atkinson lists “SCARAB Remotely Operated Vehicle Design Work” as his focus from 1992-1996. Here’s the part on thrilling submarine spycraft:

He further describes his works as the “undetected penetration of the cable itself, and of splitters, repeaters, and amplifiers modules.” This was done, in Atkinson’s account, with AT&T Bell Labs, the U.S. Special Collection Service, the U.S. navy, and at submarine shipyards. The Special Collection Service is a joint NSA/CIA venture, tasked with collecting information on communication not just passing through the United States but, according to documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, as they’re observed elsewhere in the world.

Atkinson’s work at the time, as spelled out plainly in his profile, worked with nuclear-powered attack submarines to see if they could become spy machines, with remotely operated vehicles cutting into and splicing the communication cables under the sea.

According to Adam Weinstein and William Arkin, writing last year for Gawker’s intelligence and national security blog, Phase Zero, the Annapolis is a premier computer network exploitation (CNE) toolkit, a portable hacking platform that snoops on any designated target, be it another country’s infrastructure, military troops, or its underwater communications cables.  
The subs represent an important part of America’s cyber strategy. According to two U.S. Navy officials at a recent Washington conference, they not only act defensively to defend themselves and the country from digital attack, but also interestingly they play a part in carrying out cyberattacks.  
“There is an offensive capability that we are, that we prize very highly,” said Rear Adm. Michael Jabaley, the U.S. Navy’s program executive officer for submarines. “And this is where I really can’t talk about much, but suffice to say we have submarines out there on the front lines that are very involved, at the highest technical level, doing exactly the kind of things that you would want them to do.”  
American submarine fleet has been using information technology to gain a competitive edge over the enemy. For instance, in 1970s, the U.S. government would use its submarines for unauthorized connections to the Soviet submarine cable and record messages, exchanged between the armed forces of the USSR. (The National Security Agency (NSA) has continued that tradition; wiretapping submarine cables has become part of the action covering the entire world of the U.S. intelligence apparatus. In some cases, the government even entered into the transaction with the owners of cable networks, which provided American spies secure access to the information communicated on such cables.)  
Some U.S. subs these days come armed with sophisticated and powerful antennas that can be used to intercept and even manipulate other people’s communications, particularly in poorly protected or unencrypted networks.  
In a typical week, a leaked slide showed that the Navy carries out hundreds of so-called “computer network exploitations.”  
“Annapolis and its sisters are the infiltrators of the new of cyber warfare,” wrote Arkin and Weinstein, “getting close to whatever enemy – inside their defensive zones – to jam and emit and spoof and hack. They do this through mast-mounted antennas and collection systems atop the conning tower, some of them one-of-a-kind devices made for hard to reach or specific targets, all of them black boxes of future war.”  
However, this is nothing. The next the Navy wants to do is to be able to turn its submarines into motherships for underwater drones that can move themselves even closer to shore and carry out jamming or hacking operations while letting the sub to work at a distance.  
“We want the boat to grow longer arms,” said Rear Adm. Charles Richard, director of the Navy’s undersea warfare division. “We are at all-ahead flank [speed], both on unmanned aerial and undersea vehicles.”  
When it comes to submarine-based cyber offense, there is no clarity as to how far behind or ahead other country’s navies are. However, one thing is clear that U.S. military have some of the most complex information networks ever designed, and they are using them to infiltrate into foreign computer systems as a part of developing cyber strategy.","The article titled 'U.S. using submarines to hack other countries' discusses the role of U.S. submarines in cyber warfare, specifically their capabilities to target and manipulate underwater communications cables.

President Trump's executive order and the Commerce Department’s ""Entity List"" create new challenges for Huawei’s 5G wireless technology in the U.S. But in the meantime, the Chinese telecom giant is racing ahead under the world’s seas.

**Why it matters:** Globally, about 380 submarine cables carry the vast majority of international data, from cloud computing to text messaging. These cables will only become more important with the arrival of 5G and other services that will increase the speed and volume of data being transferred.

**Where it stands:** The underseas cable market is changing with the entrance of new players.  
- A decade ago, Chinese companies were involved with just a handful of cables, almost exclusively in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong.  
- Now China wants to dominate the global market. Huawei is building or improving nearly 100 submarine cables around the world.  
- At the same time, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and other leading content providers are investing in their own underseas cable projects.

**Between the lines:** China’s digital silk road is where two of Xi Jinping’s signature policies meet:  
1.  Made in China 2025 is aggressively growing high-tech industries with state subsidies and ambitious targets, including capturing 60% of the global market for fiber optic communications.  
2.  The Belt and Road Initiative is an avenue for Chinese firms to expand into foreign markets and reach these targets, backed by a promised trillion dollars of infrastructure spending.

**Flashback:** History cautions that today’s commercial activities carry strategic stakes as well. In World War I, Britain was best positioned to maintain global communications among its forces and to monitor and disrupt enemy messages thanks to its network of cables.

**The bottom line:** So far, U.S. actions are focused on limiting Huawei’s access to Western markets. But to shape tomorrow’s communications networks, it would also have to compete in developing and emerging markets — especially in Asia and Africa, where 90% of global population growth by 2050 is expected.

Washington is worried about Moscow’s ability to disrupt global Internet communications.

Russia has been stepping up its submarine patrols near remote locations of fiber optic cables laid on the ocean floor and carrying digital data across continents. Pentagon officials and European diplomats compared Russian activities to Cold War levels, when both East and West repeatedly tried to tap undersea cables for intelligence.

The United States is particularly concerned about Russia’s capabilities to interrupt global internet traffic by cutting undersea cables in the event of a conflict. Russian submarine patrols have risen by over 50 percent in the last year.

However, the precise nature of Russian activities remains highly classified. A U.S. Navy spokesman stated that they do not discuss specifics due to the classified nature of submarine operations.

It is also known that the U.S. has been the most active in tapping undersea cables for intelligence. Most people are unaware that global digital connectivity relies on fiber optic cables at the bottom of the oceans. Ninety-nine percent of transcontinental Internet traffic travels through these cables.

Most cable cuts occur due to ship anchors, natural disasters, or fishing nets. While the reliability of these cables is high, international politics have created chokepoints where outages could have severe consequences. These chokepoints are closely monitored by U.S. and allied naval assets.

In the event of a cable cut, repair times can vary greatly, depending on how quickly the involved parties can respond. Some countries are known to delay repair permits, which poses a significant risk to global connectivity.

Rather than focusing solely on the threat from Russia, the real issue is the bureaucratic red tape that can delay repairs, impacting global communications and economies.","The article 'Undersea Cables: How Russia Targets the West’s Soft Underbelly' discusses the vulnerability of undersea cables, particularly in the context of Russian submarine activities.

Hidden beneath the world’s oceans lies an extraordinary technological feat — a network of cables stretching across the ocean floor for hundreds of thousands of kilometers, serving as our underwater power grid and information superhighway. Submarine cables, also known as subsea cables, are key to accelerating the green energy transition and form the backbone of the communication revolution.

There are currently around 600 in-service and planned submarine cable systems, stretching nearly 1.4 million kilometers across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and other strategic passages. Subsea power cables, particularly those using high-voltage direct current (HVDC) technology, can transmit substantial amounts of power across long distances. For example, the spans around 760 kilometers between the U.K. and Denmark and has a capacity of 1,400 MW, which is enough to power some 1.4 million homes. Subsea telecom cables, meanwhile, are capable of transmitting and offer the fastest and most reliable method of data transfer available today.

The fact that data and electricity travel between continents through cables not much thicker than a garden hose is a remarkable feat of engineering and multilateral collaboration. Given their pivotal role in facilitating data transfer and expansion of new technologies like AI, subsea cables have become critical to maintaining order and driving economic growth in the digital age. So, what is a submarine cable made of and how is it installed?

**Critical subsea infrastructure**

Submarine cables can be divided into two categories: high-voltage power cables and telecommunication cables. High-voltage power cables carry renewable power from offshore energy farms to the land, whereas telecom cables ferry data between continents. Each type has a different core, insulator, and armoring to ensure the cable can perform its intended function.

Cable routes are meticulously planned to avoid fault zones, fishing and anchoring areas, and other potential hazards as they form the backbone of the global internet. Damage to these cables, whether accidental or intentional, poses a significant challenge. Man-made threats, such as shipping activities, can inadvertently damage cables through anchoring or trawling. More concerning are deliberate acts of sabotage, where cables are intentionally cut or tampered with. Such actions can cripple communication networks, disrupt financial markets, and even pose national security risks.

In the context of national security, the integrity of these networks has become a matter of national interest as well as regional and global concern. As such, countries are increasingly focused on ensuring that this critical infrastructure is secure and protected. This involves not only safeguarding the physical cables but also ensuring that they are constructed and maintained by trusted manufacturers and suppliers. By doing so, nations aim to mitigate the risks associated with potential vulnerabilities and ensure the continued reliability of global communication networks.

**Optimizing cables in the era of AI**

Resilient cable infrastructure can reduce the impact of potential disruptions, and can play a significant role in its construction, maintenance, and optimization. In fact, the private sector owns and operates a substantial portion of the global submarine telecommunication network, with tech giants estimated to own or lease a majority of all undersea bandwidth between them. In the era of AI and cloud computing, these investments are crucial as the digital landscape evolves, driven by the increasing reliance on AI, edge computing, and Internet of Things (IoT). As these technologies grow, so does the number of data centers, requiring a corresponding expansion in power infrastructure to handle AI’s vast energy consumption. In fact, the demand for subsea power cables has already surged in recent years as governments and companies seek ways to transmit power across long distances. And based on the global renewable energy pipeline, the market for undersea power cables is expected to grow substantially, with governments increasingly in favor of cross-border power sharing to accelerate the green transition.

**Building better cables**

As data centers’ demand for electricity continues to rise, power cables will need to carry higher voltages, and advanced insulating materials can help achieve the necessary performance levels while improving overall efficiency and conductivity. Better insulators are therefore crucial for subsea power cables, especially when building high voltage grids for the energy transition.

Hanwha Solutions Chemical Division, with its cable insulation technologies including cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE), Super Extra-High Voltage (SEHV), and Compound LDPE Natural Submarine (CLNS), is helping to build better cables that can more efficiently transmit energy from offshore energy farms to data centers. In 2022, Hanwha Solutions became the first Korean company to develop a semiconductive material that is needed to manufacture high-voltage power cables. This year, it reached another milestone by becoming the first Korean company to develop a specialized insulator for cables, positioning itself as a leader in this sector. With an impressive annual production capacity of 110,000 tons, Hanwha’s XLPE production ranks third globally, underscoring its competitive edge in the market.

Given their ability to transmit large amounts of electricity over long distances, subsea power cables enable the integration of renewable energy sources into the power grid, making them essential for the push toward a more sustainable and resilient energy system. According to CRU, a raw materials analysis firm based in the U.K., the global demand for subsea cables is projected to increase from $4.6 billion in 2022 to $21.3 billion in 2029.","The article titled ""Submarine cables and the digital revolution"" discusses submarine cables, their critical role in telecommunications and power transmission, and the implications of damage to these cables.

If the Americans could locate sunken subs and retrieve satellites from the supposedly inviolable deeps, their underwater black ops directly threatened Soviet security.

When a July 2015 undersea tremor triggered a rockslide between the islands of Saipan and Tinian in the Northern Marianas Islands, it cut the only fiber-optic cable connecting the archipelago to the global network. Air traffic control grounded flights, automated teller machines shut down, web and phone connections broke.

All the feared impacts of a cyber attack became real for the islanders. A Taiwan-based cable repair ship eventually restored the link, but that was a single break from one natural occurrence. How much more disruption could a deep-sea-faring nation cause its rivals through malicious intent?

Though often mentioned in passing, the fact that the overwhelming bulk of Internet activity travels along submarine cables fails to register with the public. High-flying satellites orbiting the crowded skies, continent-spanning microwave towers and million miles of old 20th Century copper phone wire all carry but a fraction of the Earth’s Internet traffic compared with deep-sea fiber-optic cables.

All that buzz occurs in the dark cold parts of inner space and a few very quiet places on land. If you want to tap into that buzz, those quiet places where the sea cables make landfall—from the onshore facilities out to deep-water offshore—are your prized targets. The U.S. has developed exquisite abilities to access underwater things.

One of America’s greatest techno-spy capers of the Cold War involved tapping Soviet Navy communications via a submarine cable in the 1970s and 1980s. Before IVY BELLS ended with its unmasking by Soviet spy Ronald Pelton, its clandestine aquanauts, spy sub and nuclear-powered “bug” made espionage history.

If, however, you wish to practice hybrid warfare—disruption and degradation with little overt engagement—then the ability to cut submarine cables at will and at depth gives you a very powerful weapon. Cut up undersea hydrophone networks and you deafen your adversary. Cut Internet cables and you have the ultimate denial-of-service cyber weapon.

In the 1960s, America’s advancing deep-sea capabilities alarmed the Soviets for good reason. Amidst a wave of 1960s deep-sea activity—including its saturation-diving SEALAB program, its search & recovery missions for USS Thresher, USS Scorpion, a lost H-bomb and a new submarine-rescue approach—Admiral Hyman Rickover got his dream sub built. Launched in 1968, the NR-1 was a marvel of American ingenuity—a nuclear-powered four-man minisub able to dive over 3,000ft and stay there for weeks.

During the later Cold War, the USSR developed its own very sophisticated underwater black ops capabilities. Targets included the US Navy’s SOSUS underwater hydrophone system which ran along the Atlantic from Greenland to the United Kingdom at depths of up to 12,000ft. With its primacy in titanium metallurgy and skill in nuclear technology, the Soviet Union built several competitors to the NR-1.

The Russian Federation inherited these assets along with the Ministry of Defense branch (GUGI, or Main Directorate Deep Sea Research) that supervised those programs. The Russian deep-sea clandestine systems survived the collapse of the USSR and received funding even during the lean years during the 1990s. Even as the United States lost the NR-1’s capabilities to retirement, Russia bolstered its deep-sea black activities.

Between August and October 2012, a Russian Arctic expedition mapped the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean to locate resources and establish maritime boundaries. A deep-sea “research” submarine placed a small Russian flag on the ocean floor some 13,200ft below the North Pole to mark Russia’s claims.

The “research sub” was in fact one of Russia’s secret deep-sea assets, the nuclear-powered minisub Losharik. With Losharik, its sister sub Nelma and the two bathyscaphes Rus and Consul, the GUGI commands the largest manned deep-sea fleet in the world. Whether domestically produced or foreign imports, these assets can be quietly moved around within Russia itself. Combined with its growing submarine-rescue fleet and Naval Spetznaz outfits, Russia now fields a very powerful undersea hybrid warfare capability. Let’s hope the US Navy is on the case.

**Author:** Monica Blaylock  
**Published Date:** 08/01/2013  

Government surveillance and the tapping of communication cables is not a new threat to public privacy. Edward Snowden may have brought to light some of the NSA’s more recent eavesdropping strategies, but citizen surveillance in America has a much older history. In fact, tapping civilian communication lines dates all the way back to the late 1800s and America's occupation of the Philippines, which in part served as a test-run for the US to figure out how they could create a surveillance state in the burgeoning information age.

Long before whistleblower Edward Snowden or any mention of the PRISM program, people were intercepting one another’s phone calls. Early phone systems required a human operator to patch through a call, and that human connection made it very easy for a third-party to eavesdrop. But it wasn’t until the creation of operator-free phones that we saw the invention of modern cable tapping.

In order to try and get a better sense of how the history of surveillance has evolved since people first learned how to use a telephone, I gave surveillance expert and NSA critic James Bamford a call. He’s an American best-selling author of a book called Body of Secrets in which he explores the history of citizen surveillance in America, to find out more about how cable tapping originated.

Bamford explained that, “in the early 20th century a lot of communication cables were made from copper, which made tapping them quite a bit easier than today’s fiber optic cables.”

He also noted that a hacker, “wouldn’t need to use any invasive measures to tap a copper cable,” because they radiated electromagnetic energy. Instead of splicing it, Bamford explained you would only need to wrap the cable in a bugging device that could pick up the vibrations of its passing information.

Throughout the last century there have been plenty of examples of American governments tapping domestic and foreign communication lines. Including 1945’s Project SHAMROCK where the Armed Forces Security Agency received a microfilm copy of every telegram that entered and left the country. Or the Watergate Scandal in which President Nixon attempted to wiretap the Democratic National Committee headquarters.

But just as these types of above-land interceptions began to become commonplace, Russia, the Cold War threat, moved their communication cables somewhere very out of reach—the bottom of the ocean floor.

But don’t worry, America found a way to tap that too. They implemented Operation Ivy Bells, a covert operation to tap the Russian submarine communication cable in the Sea of Okhotsk. This cable was in an important location that joined the major Soviet Pacific Fleet naval base at Petropavlovsk on the Kamchatka Peninsula to the Soviet Pacific Fleet's mainland headquarters at Vladivostok. As Bamford pointed out, “the US had a big _big_ interest in finding out what was going on on that cable. So they sent a navy submarine called the USS Halibut to tap it, even though it was in enemy waters”. He continued, “the submarine stayed close to the shorelines. To find the cable they searched for signs along the coast directing local fishing boats to steer clear of underwater lines.”

In the instance of operation Ivy Bells, the US army felt the cable could divulge invaluable information about Russian missile operations, and so it’s relatively easy to understand their motives for surveillance. But after the Cold War, these methods did not disappear. In fact, they grew stronger and stronger as world-wide underwater communication cables grew alongside the rise of the Internet.

Today, every single country is plugged into hundreds of inter-connected submarine communication cables that are collectively known as the “backbone of the Internet”. Together these lines communicate about 99% of all Internet data around the world. The image below shows exactly where most of these underwater cables are located. Unsurprisingly, many submarine communication cables have landing points on US or US friendly soil.

Because of the relatively easy-to-hack nature of copper cables, as well as their limited capabilities, most of the modern submarine communication networks run using fiber optics. Unlike their radiating predecessors, fiber optic cables use a beam of light to transfer data and that beam cannot usually be detected outside of the cable itself. That means that you cannot easily tap fiber optic cables without risky invasive procedures. But even so, there are a couple of ways to do it and Bamford walked us through the first one:

“Fiber optic cables don’t use electricity like copper cables do; they use photons, a beam of light, to transfer data. To tap a fiber optic cable you put a prism into the cable itself so it forms a sort-of crystal triangle. When the light beam hits the prism one light beam then splits into two light beams. The original light beam continues on to wherever it was going—an email, Facebook, another country, whatever. Then the second light beam—this new mirror image—is directed to a nearby surveillance data center.” Well, I guess now we know where the PRISM name comes from.

The second way to tap a fiber optic cable is by bending the cable until it leaks light. This method is both non-invasive (so it’s harder to detect by security systems) and relatively cheap. For around $1000, any hacker can purchase the equipment necessary to pull off a fiber optic cable tap on land, although if the cable happens to be underwater the cost would probably be a lot higher.

Both tapping methods are an effective way to source private internet data and we know, thanks to Snowden, that these methods have been employed by the NSA. In fact, as Bamford explained to us, there is a still active US navy submarine called the USS Jimmy Carter that was rumored to have been outfitted with a hull specifically designed to allow technicians to tap fiber optic submarine cables while remaining underwater.

The PRISM revelations brought to the world by Edward Snowden and the Guardian showed the world that cable tapping is common practice in government surveillance, and it probably isn’t going anywhere. One only needs to recall the Five Eyes—an intelligence partnership finalized in 1980 between Canada, the United States, England, Britian, and New Zealand to completely spy on the world—to realize this is nothing new. Although the methods of tapping communication gateways has evolved from bugging telephone lines and tapping submarine cables to collecting internet metadata and filling up military data centers with digital information, the heart of the operation remains the same.

For a very long time, our governments have been tapping civilian communication lines without public knowledge, in order to gain access to our most intimate information. The frightening truth is that it probably won’t stop. So maybe the next time you’re thinking of sharing some important piece of information via email, try hand delivering a note instead. Or try something really novel and have a conversation in person. It’s more secure that way.

On Wed, May 23, 2001, there was a discussion about the NSA allegedly tapping undersea fiber optic cables, with claims that the USS Jimmy Carter, a nuclear-powered sub, is being retrofitted for this purpose. The challenge lies not only in tapping the cables but also in processing the massive amounts of data generated.

The NSA's task has evolved from intercepting signals in the air to tapping into fiber-optic cables, which presents significant technological and legal challenges. The agency has attempted undersea taps in the past, but the results have been mixed due to the overwhelming volume of data.

The article also highlights that undersea cable taps could create vulnerabilities in the telecommunications infrastructure and raise legal issues regarding the interception of communications.

Despite these challenges, the NSA continues to pursue advancements in this area, including the retrofitting of submarines for potential future operations.

For further details on the complexities and implications of these operations, please refer to the full article at [Cryptome](https://cryptome.org/nsa-fibertap.htm).","The article discusses the NSA's efforts to tap undersea fiber optic cables, which implies a concern for the vulnerabilities of these cables.

Although it does not explicitly mention 'cut sea cables,' it addresses the implications of tapping these cables and their impact on telecommunications and data security.

The central theme revolves around the challenges and risks associated with accessing undersea cables, making it relevant to the topic."

April 24, 2019 7:35 AM

Google-funded Curie cable touched down in Valparaíso, Chile, on April 23, 2019.

Google announced a milestone in its bid to control the world’s internet infrastructure as its first privately funded intercontinental subsea cable touched down in Chile yesterday. The technology titan first revealed the Curie project last January, alongside two other new cables, while touting itself as the “first major non-telecom company” to build a private international cable.

Curie runs 10,000km from Los Angeles, California all the way down the Pacific coast to Valparaíso, some 120km northwest of Chile’s capital, Santiago.

Though Curie represents the first fully Google-owned international subsea cable to be completed, it is actually one of 13 the company has invested in over the past decade.

**Unity (2010)**

Stretching 9,620km from Chikura, Japan all the way to Redondo Beach, California, Unity is co-owned by a number of well-known companies, including Google, Telstra, Singtel, KDDI, Airtel (Bharti), and Time.com.

**Southeast Asia Japan Cable (SJC) (2013)**

Opened for service in 2013, the Southeast Asia Japan Cable (SJC) spans 8,900km of ocean, with landing points covering Chikura, Japan; Chung Hom Kok, Hong Kong; Nasugbu, Philippines; Shantou, China; Telisai, Brunei; and Tuas, Singapore.

**Faster (2016)**

Faster went into service in 2016 and stretches 11,629km from Bandon, Oregon (U.S.) to Tanshui, Taiwan, with additional landing points in Chikura and Shima, both in Japan.

**Monet (2017)**

Reaching 10,556km from the U.S. to Brazil, Monet went into operation in 2017 with three landing points: Boca Raton, Florida and Fortaleza and Santos in Brazil.

**Junior (2018)**

Running 390km from Rio de Janeiro to Santos, Junior was technically Google’s first fully owned subsea cable, but given that it runs to and from Brazil, it’s not “international.”

**Tannat (2018)**

Tannat runs 2,000km from Las Toninas, Argentina to Santos, Brazil — with an additional landing point in Maldonado, Uruguay.

**Pacific Light Cable Network (PLCN) (2019)**

The PLCN cable is co-owned by Google, Facebook, and Pacific Light Data Communication Co. Ltd., which is a subsidiary of China Soft Power Technology Holdings. The cable is expected to be completed by Q3, 2019.

**Indigo (2019)**

The Indigo cable project constitutes two segments — Indigo-Central, which runs 4,850km from Perth to Sydney in Australia, and Indigo-West, which is 4,600km long.

**Havfrue/AEC-2 (2019)**

The Havfrue/AEC-2 undersea cable spans 7,200km from Wall Township, New Jersey to Western Europe.

**Japan-Guam-Australia South (JGA-S) (2019)**

The JGA-S cable will run 6,200km from Piti, Guam to Australia — with landing points in Maroochydore and Sydney.

**Hong Kong-Guam (HK-G) (2020)**

The HK-G cable is expected to be operational by 2020, stretching 3,900km across the Philippine Sea.

**Dunant (2020)**

Dunant spans 6,400km from Virginia Beach in the U.S. to Saint-Hilaire-de-Riez, France.

Google’s increasing investment in submarine cables fits into a broader trend of major technology companies investing in the infrastructure their services rely on.","The article titled 'How Google is building its huge subsea cable infrastructure' discusses various subsea cable projects that Google has invested in, including the Curie cable, which is highlighted as a significant milestone for the company.

It seems like something more fitting of a Cold War-era James Bond movie script than present-day reality: unnamed Pentagon officials circulating reports that Russian naval vessels and submarines are lurking around undersea cables that link the United States to Europe and Asia.

The unnamed officials speculate the Russians might be trying to tap those links — or even worse, completely sever them during a time of crisis.

That’s exactly what unnamed U.S. military and intelligence officials have been telling influential news outlets such as _The New York Times_.

They’re not alone. Last week, retired NATO Supreme Commander Admiral John Stavridis warned that undersea fiber-optic cables handle almost all the world’s Internet communications and represent a serious security vulnerability should an adversary attack them.

This week, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators requested information from the secretaries of state, defense and homeland security regarding the safety of nearly 200 fiber-optic cables that link the globe electronically.

""Due to increased Russian aggression and their presence in waters these cables rest in, we are increasingly concerned with what a targeted attack on the cables the U.S. depends on could result in,"" the senators said in their request.

**Cables cut all the time**  
""Nearly all the world’s Internet traffic passes at some point through an underwater cable,"" said Doug Madory, director of Internet research at the cyber-intelligence firm Dyn. ""And rarely a week goes by that there isn’t a submarine cable break somewhere in the world.""

According to the firm TeleGeography, approximately 200 active submarine cables crisscross the ocean’s floors. These cables electronically link all of the world’s continents, except Antarctica, and nearly every island with a human population.

Undersea cables are generally around a mere 3 inches in diameter and composed of various layers of insulation, steel cables and water protection. Deep inside are bundles of thin optical fibers — tiny, flexible fibers marginally larger than a human hair. Each can each carry huge amounts of digital data; together they handle over 95 percent of all Internet and phone data between continents.

Some nations, such as Cuba or New Zealand, have only one main cable connecting them to the global Internet.

""For countries relying on a single submarine cable, the loss of that cable could be crippling for their Internet service,"" Madory told VOA. ""They may be able to fall back on bulk satellite service, but satellite has much greater latency and less capacity.""

The U.S., by contrast, has several dozen cables connected to its Atlantic and Pacific coast hubs.

**Shark snack**  
Exposed along the vast expanses of ocean seafloor, these cables face a wide range of hazards, including dragging anchors and, in some areas, sharks that inexplicably like chewing on the cables' polyethylene sheathing.

""When close to shore, these cables are encased in protective metal shielding and buried up to 3 meters deep in the seabed, but out in the deep sea they are unprotected and as thin as a garden hose,"" said Madory. ""If someone was able to locate these cables at sea, they could easily cut them.""

So could one nation sabotage another by simply mapping those cables and tapping into them — or, worse, cutting them?

""The U.S. and the former Soviet Union repeatedly tapped each other’s land lines during the Cold War,"" noted Christopher Harmer, senior naval analyst with the Institute for the Study of War and retired deputy director with the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet.

""The U.S. Navy tapped the Russian Pacific Fleet data lines for at least a couple of years,"" said Harmer.

Harmer and Madory agreed that in most areas, undersea cables could easily be cut and that the Russians have a few vessels capable of deep sea maneuvers.

Harmer said the Pentagon has long been aware of the cables' vulnerabilities to potential threats.

""Transoceanic cables are high-value targets that are extremely vulnerable to attack,"" Harmer told VOA via email. ""The U.S. Navy is highly aware of the threat, has simulated the scenarios, understands the risks, but does not have the assets to mitigate the risks.”

**Cutting vs. tapping**  
However, Madory downplays the size of the problem for the U.S.

""There are multiple cables crossing the Atlantic and Pacific, providing enormous capacity and resilience for the Internet in North America,"" Madory wrote via email. ""To even make a dent in U.S. international connectivity would require simultaneously taking out multiple cables.

""If a perpetrator with a submarine wanted to cause maximal downtime, they could attempt to cause multiple breaks at harder-to-reach locations on multiple cables, but the impacts would be fleeting,"" said Madory. ""So would such a Hollywood scenario be worth trying to pull off?""

""I don't think the Russians have a significant advantage here,"" said Harmer. ""Their economy has devolved into a resource extraction economy; they need customers for it. Cutting data lines also cuts off their customers in Western Europe from communication with North America. The real threat is IT [Internet technology] theft by China or Russia.""

Madory disagrees. ""Experts in the industry are very doubtful that it is possible to tap a fiber-optic cable on the seabed without it being noticed,"" he said.

Perhaps not, said Harmer. But that doesn’t mean that someone isn't trying.","The article discusses the vulnerabilities of undersea cables to being cut, including explicit mentions of the potential for sabotage and the geopolitical implications of such actions.

It provides expert insights on the risks associated with these cables and their importance for global internet connectivity, thus directly addressing the topic of cut sea cables."

**By Victor Abramowicz**  
  
Russia’s Navy is a highly visible and generally well-understood instrument of Moscow’s military power that has been on a slow process of re-equipment from its 1990s nadir. It now wields a fairly impressive range of capabilities, from new medium-sized ships, such as corvettes and frigates, nuclear-powered attack and ballistic missile submarines, and advanced weapons, including the Kalibr cruise missile first demonstrated attacking targets in Syria. There is, however, another far more shadowy force available to Moscow which forms Russia’s “Secret Navy”: the Main Directorate of Deep-Sea Research, or Glavnoye Upravlenie Glubokovodsk Issledovanii (GUGI).  
  
The Directorate was formed in 1976 and since then has existed separately from the rest of the armed forces administratively, physically, and operationally. For example, rather than being part of the Navy, it circumvents that chain of command and reports directly to the Ministry of Defence. Further, its staff and vessels are housed at discrete bases held apart from other military facilities, notably at Olenya Bay near Russia’s border with Norway, where a specialised covered dock keeps the most sensitive assets hidden from surveillance.  
  
Such measures are justified by the specialised and exotic nature of GUGI’s operational responsibilities. These range from oceanographic survey to the placement and maintenance of deep-water military equipment, including submarine-detection systems, as well as the identification, tapping, and potential destruction of subsea communications cables.  
  
With President Vladimir Putin revealing the Kanyon/Status-6 long-range nuclear torpedo (now officially named Poseidon) this year, GUGI will likely become responsible for this weapon system too, rendering the Directorate a key component of any Russian second-strike effort should atomic war erupt.  
  
To achieve such a diverse array of missions, GUGI has a range of equipment that appears almost James Bond–esque. Among the more standard units it has are a range of “ocean research vessels”, such as the Yantar, which hold specialised equipment, including miniature submarines, able to identify and interface with underwater communications cables.  
  
More broadly, GUGI has advanced unmanned assets, including some of the world’s largest autonomous vessels, the Harpsichord series, and the (potentially nuclear-powered) Harmony surveillance system planned for the Arctic.  
  
But such assets pale in comparison to the Directorate’s fleet of eight or more nuclear-powered special-mission submarines, the largest and most diverse force of its kind in the world.  
  
These come in two main groups. First, there is a range of fairly small vessels, ranging from the 40-metre Nelma to the modern 74-metre Losharik capable of diving as far down as 2500 metres. These submarines are equipped with advanced position-keep equipment and specialised robotic arms that enable them to approach, deploy, retrieve, maintain, and interfere with underwater infrastructure.  
  
These vessels are transported around the world by two large mother-submarines, modified versions of Delta-III and IV ballistic missile units, from which they detach and reattach underwater, beyond prying eyes. The mother-submarines provide the additional food, water, and living space for the smaller vessels’ crews to reach distant areas of operations (being nuclear-powered, range is not a constraint for such craft).  
  
However, perhaps the most impressive GUGI asset, still yet to be completed, will be the enormous Belgorod, which when finished will be the longest submarine in the world. This vessel will likely serve to provide yet another highly modern mother-submarine for the rest of the GUGI fleet, and will also be able to launch the Poseidon torpedo. At 24 metres long and nearly 1.5 metres wide, this weapon is so large that it will be far too big to fit in an unmodified submarine (a regular torpedo is nearly 30 times smaller), leaving its use restricted to the Belgorod and another specialised unit, the Khabarovsk.  
  
While GUGI is of course small compared to Russia’s primary naval forces, it has outsized relevance to NATO, and potentially also Australia. Its submarines and surface vessels have been increasingly active, particularly around transatlantic communications cables. By some estimates, 99% of global international data (including phone and internet) moves through these cables rather than paths such as satellites, meaning Russia, through tapping the cables, has access to an extremely rich source of peacetime intelligence information, and the ability to hold it at-risk should tensions rise.  
  
Notably, Australia is just as dependent on cables. The government has demonstrated recent sensitivity in keeping foreign firms, such as Huawei, from involvement in building such regional infrastructure. Russia could seek to tap our communications too, aiming to access sensitive information through a “soft underbelly”, as it once did through the spy-ring which led to the formation of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.  
  
Alternatively, having its own interests in Antarctica, Russia would doubtless be willing to apply the technology and lessons learned by GUGI in the Arctic.  
  
Considering these issues, it might be well worth paying as much attention to Moscow’s other Navy as is currently directed towards the more standard ships and submarines of Russia’s fleet.","The article discusses the operations of Russia's Main Directorate of Deep-Sea Research (GUGI), specifically mentioning their role in identifying, tapping, and potentially destroying subsea communications cables.

During the Cold War, the USS Halibut was modified for 'Underwater Engineering', a euphemism for covert intelligence gathering operations. In 1965, within 5 years of entering service, she was converted into a secret spy submarine.  

Halibut is most famous for performing the first wire-tap on the Soviet military's undersea communication cables in the Sea of Okhotsk in 1970. The missions were known as **IVY BELLS**.  

The tap itself was a large cylinder which had to be put in place by divers operating from the hovering submarine. Key to IVY BELLS' success were the USN Divers who lived in a pressure cylinder mounted above the rear torpedo room.  

The USS Halibut was also the only nuclear-powered submarine designed to launch nuclear cruise missiles. It had a massive hangar for the missiles and was a significant submarine during its time.

The [USS Parche](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/spy-submarine-no-other-come-aboard-uss-jimmy-carter-48812)—pronounced Par-chee—remains the U.S. Navy’s most decorated vessel ever in American service.

The [USS _Parche_](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/spy-submarine-no-other-come-aboard-uss-jimmy-carter-48812), commissioned in 1974, originally began life as a Sturgeon-class nuclear-powered fast attack submarine. After serving for several years in that role, the _Parche_ was selected for a different, more specialized role of top-secret reconnaissance. What would be the submarine’s target? The Soviet Union’s underwater communications cables.

In that role, the [USS Parche](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/spy-submarine-no-other-come-aboard-uss-jimmy-carter-48812) was modified several times to allow the sub greater maneuverability and to make space onboard for extra communications equipment, cameras, thrusters, landing skids, and additional sonar arrays.

The enormous amount of observation equipment that the _Parche_ carried came at a cost, however. Almost all of the submarine’s torpedoes were removed to create extra space onboard—leaving the submarine with a paltry four shots for defense in case of detection. Like other Navy submarines tasked with clandestine wiretapping missions, the _Parche_ carried a [dangerous secret](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/us-navy-submarine-terrified-russia-simple-reason-42377).

In the event that the _Parche_ was in danger of being captured by the Soviet Union, the submarine carried 150 pounds of HBX explosives onboard—a last resort scuttling charge that would preserve the submarine’s secrets and cost all the submariners their lives.

**Ivy Bells**

Perhaps the most significant (known) mission that the _Parche_ took part in was the clandestine [tapping of a Soviet underseas communication cable](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/intelligence-coup-how-one-us-nuclear-submarine-tapped-russian-undersea-cables-159086) in the [Sea of Okhotsk](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/why-did-us-air-force-send-b1-bombers-russia%E2%80%99s-doorstep-159111). The cable, running along the ocean floor, connected one of the Soviet Pacific Fleet’s bases at Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky on the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia’s far east, with the Fleet’s headquarters in Vladivostok.

The cable would be [a tough nut to crack](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/how-super-secret-us-navy-submarine-tapped-russias-underwater-21370). Not only was it within Soviet territorial waters, it was also protected by an array of acoustic listening devices that could detect surface ships and submarines. The Sea of Okhotsk also hosted Soviet Navy drills on occasion, complicating efforts to penetrate the area.

Despite the challenges, a large wiretap recording device was successfully planted in 1971 by a different espionage submarine, the [USS Halibut](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/heres-what-we-can-now-tell-you-about-uss-halibut-americas-cold-war-spy-submarine-113861)_._ Once the _Halibut_ was decommissioned, however, the _Parche_ became one of the submarines that took over the wiretapping and recording device recovery role. _Parche_ was never detected.

The USS _Parche_ also took part in cable detection and tapping operations near the North Pole and in the Barents Sea. _Parche_ would win a staggering amount of honors, including ten Presidential Unit Citations, nine Navy Unit Citations, and thirteen Expeditionary Awards.

**Postscript**

After thirty years of continuous service, the USS _Parche_ was decommissioned in 2004 and scrapped two years later. It is likely that the special spy role conducted by the _Parche_ has since been taken over by the [USS Jimmy Carter](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/we-now-have-details-uss-jimmy-carter-spy-submarines-secret-mission-129272), a modified [Seawolf-class submarine](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/us-navys-seawolf-submarine-just-sent-message-russia-168371). Today, the USS _Parche’s_ sail is preserved and on display near the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Washington.

No, the U.S. Navy is probably not using a multi-billion dollar submarine to listen in on your phone calls and emails on behalf of the National Security Agency. But it could.

A long line of secretive Navy spy submarines, most recently a nuclear-powered behemoth named USS _Jimmy Carter_, have for decades infiltrated remote waters to gather intelligence on rival states’ militaries, insurgents and terrorists on behalf of the NSA and other agencies using a range of sophisticated devices, including special equipment for tapping undersea communications cables.

Before NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed the agency’s phone and Internet monitoring programs targeting U.S. and European citizens, the mainstream press paid little attention to the elusive, subsurface warship. But following Snowden’s disclosures in 2013, several publications including the Huffington Post and the German _Der Spiegel_ speculated that the _Jimmy Carter_ was aiding the NSA’s surveillance of citizens’ communications in the U.S. and Europe.

The modified _Seawolf_-class sub, built by General Dynamics Electric Boat in Connecticut between 1998 and 2004, is almost certainly able to tap the undersea communication cables that carry much of the world’s phone and Internet traffic. But just because the warship can tap cables doesn’t mean it routinely does.

At the Navy’s request, Electric Boat inserted an extension in the middle of _Jimmy Carter_‘s hull that added 100 feet to its standard 350-foot length — plus nearly $1 billion to the baseline $2 billion price tag. Commander Christy Hagen, a Navy spokesperson, declined to comment on the warship’s modifications.

But Owen Cote, a submarine expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said _Jimmy Carter_‘s hull extension most likely contains a “moon well” — a floodable chamber to allow divers, robots and machinery to move between the sub’s interior and the water, retrieving objects off the seafloor or carrying monitoring devices and other surveillance equipment.

With this, _Jimmy Carter_ could, in theory, tap seafloor fiber-optic cables, said Norman Polmar, a naval analyst and author who has advised the government on submarine-building strategy. “You hook something on to the cable,” Polmar said, “and come back in a month and remove the tape and take it back and analyze it.”

But underwater wiretapping is probably unnecessary. “I don’t think you need to use _Jimmy Carter_ to do that,” Cote said. “It would be a waste of that asset.”

It’s far easier for the NSA to monitor Americans’ communications on land, Cote pointed out in an interview, with the consent of phone and Internet providers.

But it wasn’t long ago that _Jimmy Carter_‘s predecessor subs were involved in undersea eavesdropping — against America’s Cold War rivals. That espionage took place during a technologically simpler time, when Washington had fewer ways of listening in on communications.

“Fifty, 60 years ago, this was best method of collecting certain intelligence,” Polmar says of eavesdropping submarines. Before _Jimmy Carter_, there were the modified submarines _Halibut_, _Seawolf_ and _Parche_, fitted with special equipment for monitoring and accessing objects on the seafloor, including communications cables. _Parche_, the last of the old breed, was decommissioned in 2004, just as _Jimmy Carter_ was nearing completion.

The subs’ secret missions, the subjects of repeated investigations by high-profile reporters including Seymour Hersh in _The New York Times_, were practically the stuff of fiction.

In 1968, the Pentagon deployed _Halibut_ to the Pacific to search for the wreckage of a sunken Soviet submarine that would later be partially recovered by a CIA team aboard a purpose-built salvage ship. Trailing a four-mile long cable rigged with cameras, _Halibut_ found the Soviet vessel in 16,000 feet of water after just three weeks.

In the 1970s, _Seawolf_ and _Parche_ took risky missions penetrating the Soviet navy’s main North Atlantic bastions to tap military communication cables. The two subs sailed under the Arctic at speeds of just a few miles per hour to avoid icebergs, dodging Soviet vessels and excitable seals and walruses that might betray the U.S. ships’ locations.

The special subs placed on the cables clamp-like devices that recorded passing signals, giving Washington valuable insight into Soviet naval activities. In 1980, a former NSA employee named Ronald Pelton betrayed the subs’ operations to the Soviets in exchange for around $35,000. Pelton was arrested in 1986, tried and convicted. He remains in federal prison.

The Soviets’ discovery of the undersea wiretap alerted America’s rivals, making such missions much more difficult. “People are now aware that that’s a technological capability that we have — and that puts them on guard,” Polmar says.

The disclosure, and new technology advances, has led to an apparent shift in the spy subs’ tactics. When North Korea shelled a South Korean island base in 2010, _Jimmy Carter_ reportedly surfaced nearby and launched a small, quiet drone spy plane to photograph the damage. Since then _Jimmy Carter_ has undoubtedly stayed busy performing other surveillance missions and, in 2013, entered a roughly yearlong period of maintenance at a shipyard in Washington State.

Now that the submarine has returned to the fleet, it will surely resume its secret duties as America’s main underwater spy. But the special sub probably won’t be listening in on your phone and Internet conversations. Too dangerous against military rivals and unnecessary for domestic surveillance, submarine wiretaps seem to have fallen out of favor.

You’re still being spied on — just not by a submarine. Exactly what _Jimmy Carter_ is doing is hard to say.

1. **The Beginning of Submarine Cables**  
The first submarine cable was laid in the English Channel in 1851. The cable, which was mistaken for a new kind of seaweed, was quickly severed and became unusable the next day, but the idea spread rapidly. About 20 years later, in 1872, with the laying of submarine cable between Nagasaki, Japan and Shanghai, China, Japan was incorporated into the global network of submarine cables. The laying of submarine cables became a key national policy at that time.

In the latter half of the 19th century, Western countries actively advanced overseas. Submarine cables were used as a tool for overseas expansion. In 1881, King Kalakaua of Hawaii, which was an independent kingdom, visited Japan and requested the construction of an underwater cable between Japan and Hawaii, but Japan, being in the middle of the political upheaval of Meiji 14 (1881), could not meet this request. At the beginning of the 20th century, 60% of the world's undersea cables were owned by the British Empire or its state-owned companies. Hawaii was the last place on the Pacific route to which the British Empire was trying to connect, but it was blocked by the United States, which had great interest in Hawaii. When the Spanish-American War broke out in 1898 and the United States acquired the Philippines and Guam, it became necessary to secure a route from the west coast of the United States to Guam, and as a result Hawaii was annexed to the United States. Submarine cable installation to Hawaii became a challenge, but it was accomplished without government subsidies by businessman John W. Mackay.

Hawaii and undersea cables played an important role in raising US interest in the Pacific. For 100 years, submarine cables have been associated with geopolitical factors.

2. **Submarine Cables and War**  
When World War I broke out, Britain issued a declaration of war on Germany and, as soon as it came into force, severed German submarine cables in the North Sea. The purpose was to block much of Germany's communications and to divert them to Sweden, a neutral country, in order to facilitate wiretapping.

During World War II, wireless telegraphy was often used in addition to wired communications. As a result, the role of telegraph undersea cables has relatively declined, but it is no exaggeration to say that wiretapping determined the outcome of the war. The interception and breaking of the Japanese Purple code and the German Enigma code are well known.

As many undersea cables had been destroyed in World War II, wireless communications were used extensively after the war. However, since wired communications were harder to intercept than wireless communications, the remaining wired undersea cables were also used. As the Cold War intensified, Operation Ivy Bells was launched in the Sea of Okhotsk to intercept Soviet submarine cables. Submarine cables at that time used copper wire as the core and, when a communication signal ran through the cable, a weak signal was emitted from the cable. The United States installed equipment on Soviet seabed cables to monitor the signal, and regularly collected the equipment to analyze the data. The Soviet Union did not even encrypt communications in such places, not realizing they would be intercepted. However, a Soviet spy in the US government notified the Soviet Union of the US' wiretapping of the submarine cables, and the Soviet Union reportedly recovered the equipment.

In the 1980s, the technology to put optical fibers instead of copper wires in the core of cables was established, and communication capacity increased dramatically. The signals flowing through the cable were changed from electrical signals to optical signals, making it impossible to intercept submarine cables at the bottom of the sea like in Operation Ivy Bells.

3. **Changes in Operational Domains**  
In June 2013, Edward Snowden, who worked at the National Security Agency (NSA) facility on the island of Oahu in Hawaii, handed over top-secret NSA documents to journalists, revealing some of the Agency's activities. In the leaked documents we found a description of programs called PRISM and UPSTREAM. It is believed that the former meant acquiring data from platform companies such as Google, while the latter meant acquiring information on submarine cables. Although it is extremely difficult to intercept optical fiber cables at the bottom of the sea, the NSA is believed to have been able to intercept signals on land with the cooperation of telecommunications carriers. The NSA has not confirmed the authenticity of the leaked information, but it appears to be part of a larger surveillance of communications by the US government since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001.

Since around 2010, the US military has regarded space as its fourth operational domain and cyberspace as its fifth, in addition to the conventional operational domains of land, sea, and air. However, unlike the other four operational areas, cyberspace is an artificial domain. Cyberspace consists of physical entities such as communication terminals (PCs and smartphones), wired and wireless communication lines connecting them, and data centers that contain servers.

As long as they are physical, they can be physically damaged or destroyed. In fact, many submarine cables have been damaged by fishing nets, anchors and earthquakes. In 2013, a submarine cable was intentionally severed in Egypt. In 2015, the New York Times reported that ""Russian submarines and spy ships are aggressively operating near the vital undersea cables"" and in 2019 Admiral James Stavridis (retired) argued that ""China's next naval target is the Internet's underwater cables"", thus raising awareness that submarine cables could become targets for destruction.

4. **Submarine Cable Industry**  
Looking at the submarine cable industry, Subcom in the United States holds around 40% share in the manufacturing of submarine cables, NEC in Japan (via its affiliate OCC) roughly 30%, Alcatel-Submarine Networks (ASN) in Europe approximately 20%, and Hengtong Optic-Electric (which acquired Huawei's submarine cable division) in China less than 10%. In addition to the importance of the cables themselves, vessels for laying and repairing submarine cables, power feeding equipment (PFE) and submarine line terminal equipment (SLTE) in landing stations are also important factors in considering the safety of submarine cables.

Amid growing interest in submarine cable security, one case that garnered attention was the suspension of the PLCN (Pacific Light Cable Network). The cable, which was owned by Google and Facebook in the US and the Dr. Peng Telegraph & Media Group in China, was intended to connect to Hong Kong across the Pacific from Los Angeles on the US West Coast. However, as the trade and technological friction between the United States and China as well as the demonstrations in Hong Kong intensified, the US government refused to allow the landing in Hong Kong. The PLCN was changed to land in the Philippines and Taiwan.

Then, in August 2020, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the ""Clean Network"" project to exclude Chinese products from US apps, the cloud, submarine cables and elsewhere.

Communication monitoring is a measure implemented and emphasized by countries seeking to improve their cyber security capabilities. For example, at the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games, the US NSA collaborated with the UK Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) to share signal intelligence (SIGINT). This measure reportedly included monitoring of submarine cables.

5. **Summary**  
Submarine cables are strategic assets for governments in the information age. Since digital transformation (DX) is a key technology for the future economy, submarine cables based on clean technology are an indispensable element, and they are even more important for Japan, an island country that relies on submarine cables for 99% of its international communications.

It goes without saying that the Japanese government must exercise caution in monitoring communications bearing in mind the secrecy of communications (Article 21 of the Constitution and Article 4 of the Telecommunications Business Law). However, in order to prevent cyber attacks and communications-aided terrorist attacks, consideration should be given to surveilling communications, including those utilizing undersea cables, with supervision and auditing by democratic institutions.

**The Prize**

One of the Soviet Union’s important naval bases was located on the Kamchatka Peninsula, in Russia’s far east. The peninsula abuts the Sea of Okhotsk, a large bay west of Kamchatka and northeast of Japan. Though very far from Moscow, the Kamchatka Peninsula naval base was connected to another naval base at Vladivostok, near the Soviet Union’s border with China and North Korea. Their connection was more than figurative. It was discovered that an underwater communications cable connected the two bases and was used heavily to communicate with each other—and connected Kamchatka with Moscow.

The potential intelligence that could be gleaned from tapping the Kamchatka-Vladivostok cable was great, as would be the difficulty in gaining access to the cable. Most of the cable ran through the Sea of Okhotsk, a heavily protected bay that the Soviet Union considered to be part of its territorial waters. There were extensive anti-submarine obstacles and acoustic listening devices with which to monitor surface and underwater traffic. It would be a tough mission, but if successful, immeasurably valuable.

**The Boat**

Not just any submarine could be sent deep underwater to tap a cable however, a special sub was needed. The nuclear-powered USS Halibut was chosen for the tapping mission. Originally diesel-powered, Halibut had been converted to nuclear power and repurposed for special operations missions. To better serve as a special operations-capable sub Halibut underwent several modifications to support Navy divers. Special skids were installed to allow the sub to sit on the ocean floor, anchors were placed along the hull to keep the sub in place, a diving chamber mated to the deck to allow divers access to the outside, as well as an array of photographic and robotic equipment.

Though the Americans knew the Kamchatka-Vladivostok cable existed, they did not know exactly where. Looking for a slender cable on the seafloor would have been like looking for a needle in a haystack, and dangerous. The cables were allegedly found thanks to the signs posted on the shore where the cables left the sea, warning fishermen and boaters not to drop their anchors or nets in the areas indicated by the cables to prevent them from fouling.

**The Mission**

The top-secret nature of the Halibut’s mission precluded most of the sub’s crew from knowing what the true nature of the cable tap mission was. To protect mission secrecy, the crew was told that they would be attempting the recovery of a weapon over a Soviet missile range, which was in fact the mission’s secondary objective.

One of the technical challenges was gaining access to information being transmitted through the cable, without cutting into the cable itself. A breach could cause a short circuit and alert the Soviets that something was up. Instead of cutting into the cable, divers were able to pull information via induction by wrapping another cable around the main comms cable.

The first tap successfully harvested information, but not in a form that was actionable. The cable was actually about a dozen different lines all talking at the same time. Separating the speakers' voices into different audio channels was done in subsequent taps.

Ultimately Ivy Bells was a success. The twelve or so different lines of audio could be separated. The Soviet Union was so sure that the line was secure, not all of the communications that went through the line were encrypted. Ivy Bell’s secondary weapons harvest mission was also a success and American engineers were given enough of the recovered missile to make a reverse-engineered copy.

**Postscript**

Ivy Bells was eventually discovered, though not through any detection of the part of the Soviet Union. In 1980, an indebted former NSA intelligence analyst approached the Soviet embassy in Washington D.C. and revealed the existence of the Kamchatka-Vladivostok cable tap, ending its nearly ten-year run.

There appears to be renewed interest in undersea cables, however. Not secret communication cables, but fiber-optic internet cables that carry much of the world’s internet traffic which, if severed could potentially cripple governments or economies thanks to the degree to which the world depends on the internet. In a time of crisis, severing underwater internet cables could be catastrophic. We are it seems, going back to the future.

While General Dynamics Electric Boat was still putting the submarine together in 2001, NSA director Lt. Gen. Michael Hayden laughed off claims about breaking into undersea cables in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. “I’m not going to sit here and dissuade you from your views,” Hayden said, before refusing to comment on Jimmy Carter‘s mission. Two years later, the Journal again reported that the submarine’s role suggested an undersea spook, citing “people knowledgeable about it.” After more than a decade of apparently very active service, little else has slipped out about the ship or her operations.

On January 20, 2013, the Seawolf-class attack submarine USS Jimmy Carter left her home port in Bangor, Washington. Less than two months later, the submarine appeared at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii for repairs.

It was all quite mysterious. During her time at sea, we don’t know where Jimmy Carter was or what her crew of nearly 150 were precisely doing. The Seawolf class is one of the most secretive weapons in America’s arsenal, and information about the Navy’s “Silent Service” is difficult to discover. . . by design.

We know Jimmy Carter was on some kind of mission, which the ship’s official annual history vaguely referred to as Mission 7. “Performed under a wide range of adverse and extremely stressful conditions without external support, this deployment continued USS Jimmy Carter‘s tradition of excellence in pursuit of vital national security goals,” the history stated.

In this vessel’s official chronology, the mission warrants as much mention as a picnic in July and the crew’s Halloween party three months later. But Mission 7 was enough to earn the sailors a Presidential Unit Citation, which rewards “extraordinary heroism in action against an armed enemy,” according to an official Navy description.

As the last of the Seawolf-class attack submarines, Jimmy Carter is unique. During her construction, the Pentagon added a special one-hundred-foot-long, 2,500-ton module called the Multi-Mission Platform. By the sailing branch’s own admission, this space can accommodate undersea drones, SEALs and much more.

More importantly, the hourglass-shaped section might allow specially trained teams to find and tap undersea communications lines and plant listening devices on the ocean floor. It’s more than likely that the submarine is one of the Pentagon’s most stealthy spies.

Another clue is the Presidential Unit Citation for Mission 7. For the sailing branch, this is akin to giving the boat itself a Navy Cross, the service’s second highest award. The criteria makes it clear that the mission must have been “extremely difficult and hazardous.” But the Secretary of the Navy’s citation for the sub’s 2013 performance is equally obtuse.

Along with sailors from the even more obscure Detachment Undersea Research and Development, Jimmy Carter “successfully completed extremely demanding and arduous independent submarine operations of vital importance to the national security of the United States,” is how the memo described the operation. Both units “overcame numerous obstacles to safely execute these demanding and complex tasks without incident.”

Two pictures attached to the report show the ship’s captain, Cmdr. Brian Elkowitz, and other officers holding the framed citation and associated pennant. In both cases, Navy censors blacked out one individual’s face, ostensibly for privacy reasons.

War Is Boring obtained these documents through the Freedom of Information Act. Every year, all ships, subs, squadrons of aircraft and commands on land are required to turn a historical report over to the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington, D.C. But there’s no requirement that the narrative go into any great or specific detail. And Jimmy Carter‘s history is more a record of the secrecy surrounding the ship’s than her actual activities.

While already guarded about submarines in general, the Navy is especially tight-lipped about the Seawolf-class boats. Originally intended to be the most advanced undersea attackers, Washington slashed the program after the Cold War and the threat of equally high-tech Soviet submarines appeared to evaporate.

Instead of a planned fleet of nearly 30 ships, the Pentagon bought just three for more than $3 billion each. At more than 350 feet long and with a submerged displacement of more than 9,100 tons, the Seawolf class is the most expensive attack submarine ever built and the second most expensive undersea vessel of any type.

The sailing branch eventually grouped together the USS Seawolf, Connecticut and Jimmy Carter as the core of Submarine Development Squadron Five. The unit’s spartan Web site states it is responsible for testing new undersea listening gear and remote-controlled submersibles, either tethered to a larger sub or able to operate on their own.

The group is also in charge developing new tactics for fighting in the Arctic, a region where submarines can easily hide from their opponents. Despite their current mission, each ship still has eight torpedo tubes, which can also fire Harpoon anti-ship and Tomahawk cruise missiles.

The unit makes no mention of intelligence gathering. But while the name implies a solely experimental function, the sailing branch routinely uses these types of monikers for special or elite groups. The near legendary terrorist-hunting SEAL Team Six is officially called the Naval Special Warfare Development Group. The service describes the spy ships it runs together with the U.S. Air Force as “missile range instrumentation ships.” The squadron responsible for flying around the president and his staff is now simply called Marine Helicopter Squadron One, but still uses the acronym HMX-1—a nod to its “experimental” origins.

Further lending credibility to Jimmy Carter‘s real spying mission, the Navy retired the equally shadowy USS Parche just four months before putting the new submarine into action. The sailing branch says Parche is the most decorated ship ever, with nine Presidential Unit Citations among other awards.

Completed in 1974 as a Sturgeon-class attack sub, the Pentagon specifically upgraded the Parche to break into Soviet communications lines. Between 1978 and 1979, the submarine reportedly tapped into cables in the Sea of Okhotsk north of Japan as part of a mission dubbed Operation Ivy Bells.

“The Navy, with strong input from the NSA, was first sending Parche to Okhotsk to plant a second recording pod. . . to greatly increase capacity at the tap site,” Sherry Sontag and Christopher Drew wrote in Blind Man’s Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage. “She was being sent, in part, to prove herself before anyone dared to send her to that other, far more dangerous sea.”

Success at Okhotsk paved the way for missions in the far more crowded—and therefore dangerous—Barents Sea. To hide from Moscow’s sub-hunters, Parche hid under the cover of the Arctic ice as she sneaked into congested shipping lanes.

Nearly a decade later, the Navy sent Parche off for another overhaul. In 1991, the sailing branch sent the newly refurbished sub to join Submarine Development Squadron Five.

Though their book was published before the submarine was finished, Sontag and Drew explained that Jimmy Carter‘s expanded mid-section was to make room for the same gear Parche had carried into Soviet waters. No doubt the Navy and its partners at the NSA have made improvements since then.

While General Dynamics Electric Boat was still putting the submarine together in 2001, NSA director Lt. Gen. Michael Hayden laughed off claims about breaking into undersea cables in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. “I’m not going to sit here and dissuade you from your views,” Hayden said, before refusing to comment on Jimmy Carter‘s mission.

**Summary:** The crisis in the Red Sea, highlighted by Houthi assaults on commercial ships and Iran's proxy strategies, also brings to light the critical issue of undersea cables' vulnerability. These cables are essential for EU-Asia digital communication and trade, and their disruption could severely impact the global economy and EU's economic security. The article discusses the strategic importance of these cables, the limited repair capacities within the EU, the geopolitical challenges of cable maintenance, and the straightforward methods by which such cables can be targeted. It underscores the necessity for comprehensive maritime security that includes undersea cable protection, urging a unified NATO approach and the exploration of alternative data routes through the Arctic for enhanced digital resilience.

The ongoing crisis in the Red Sea has generated considerable discussions and debates, primarily focusing on the detrimental effects of the Houthis assaults on commercial ships and Iran’s “creative” use of its proxies as part of its forward defense strategy. Amid these discussions, however, an equally alarming prospect has received insufficient attention: the intentional damaging of undersea cables in the Red Sea and its impact on the global economy and the economic security of U.S. allies in the European Union (EU).

The strategic significance of undersea cables in the Red Sea for EU-Asia connectivity cannot be overstated. These cables serve as the backbone for digital communication and trade between Europe and Asia, rendering them prime targets for disruption by hostile actors. From an economic perspective, the EU’s heavy dependence on fast and reliable connectivity underscores the imperative to safeguard undersea cable networks. With over 70 percent of EU-based companies relying on online services like cloud computing, it is evident that any prolonged disruption would have significant repercussions for the EU’s economic security and global trade. Given the central role of social networks in Europe's highly digitalized societies, social life could be severely disrupted if these cables or their landing stations were to come under attack.

Any prolonged disruption could have dire consequences for the EU's overall security. Therefore, the vulnerability of these cables to intentional damage must be a significant concern on par with the current apprehensions regarding Houthi attacks on commercial vessels traversing the Red Sea. The reason behind this assertion is twofold.

First, while the immediate threat may appear distant, policymakers and strategic planners in Brussels must recognize the potential risks associated with factors such as the redundancy level of cable networks, the EU’s limited repair capacities, and the possibility of simultaneous attacks on both cables and landing stations.

Ten cable systems spanning the Red Sea, Suez Canal, Mediterranean, and Indian Ocean collectively form the core of digital connectivity between mainland Europe and the trading blocs of Southern and Eastern Asia. Of particular concern in this context is the European Union's constrained repair capacity and the recent politicization of cable projects, which are unfortunate byproducts of fast-intensifying geopolitical contestation between the United States and China.

Regarding the former, repair works are outsourced to external partners as part of the industry standard fuelled by a desire to cut costs and increase efficiency. Under the Mediterranean Cable Maintenance Agreement (MECMA), which covers the ten cable networks linking the EU with East/South Asia, the repair will be done by two cable ships stationed in Italy and France. However, due to the extensive geographical coverage area, repair capacities are notably limited, increasing the likelihood of prolonged outages in simultaneous attacks.

Low redundancy levels and a dire lack of alternative cable systems for rerouting data flow between the EU and East/South Asia pose a similar, if not more dire, challenge should the Mediterranean cables become inoperative. While not solely a consequence of the escalating digital divide between the West and China, the politicization of cable projects exacerbates this vulnerability. Initiatives like the Clean Network will likely curtail future cable projects, perpetuating the EU’s reliance on a limited number of networks and exposing it to continued outage risks. A clear illustration of this predicament is the fate of South East Asia–Middle East–Western Europe 6 (SEA-ME-WE 6), which was halted due to Washington’s objection to China’s involvement despite its predecessor, SEA ME WE 5, being a collaborative endeavor involving American and Chinese companies.

While damaging undersea cables may initially appear complex, carrying out such activities is not a sophisticated mission. Undersea cables can be targeted through various means, with physical destruction being the most common method. The least complicated approach involves “weaponizing” civilian vessels using improvised devices like anchors to cause damage intentionally. These attacks are cost-effective and do not require sophisticated undersea capabilities. Another form of physical attack is the use of undersea explosives, which can be carried out by a range of actors due to their relative ease of implementation. This method involves deploying maritime improvised explosive devices, and Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) naval branch has mastered this capability, considering it as a cost-effective strategy in the Strait of Hormuz.

Overall, if resilience is the main pillar of digital autonomy, geopolitical instability in areas like the Red Sea poses a significant yet understudied strategic risk. Specifically, there is a genuine concern for the spillover effects of political instability whereby non-state actors and their state supporters may view undersea cables in major data chokepoints as legitimate targets for retaliation against perceived illegitimate or illegal policies or actions.

As a vital conduit for connectivity between the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean, the Red Sea is a prime example of such a chokepoint where there is a potential for Iran-backed Houthi rebels to redirect their focus from passing vessels to targeting undersea cables as a more cost-effective and discreet form of offense. While there is currently no indication of intent from the Houthi leadership or the Iranian government to undertake such actions, it is imprudent to discount the plausibility of such a scenario in the future.

Moreover, the mere prospect of such hostile actions serves as a crucial reminder that maritime security in our fast-approaching digital era needs a rethink. Specifically, maritime security seems no longer confined to securing sea lanes of communication but also encompasses safeguarding what lies beneath, including undersea cables and critical mineral resources necessary for the green transition. This underscores the need for comprehensive approaches to maritime security that address both traditional and emerging threats.

For their part, the United States and its European allies must utilize their common NATO membership and develop a unified approach toward enhancing the security and resiliency of undersea cables. Currently, divergent approaches exist across the Alliance, with countries like France adopting a national security approach, leveraging their armed forces and security apparatuses to safeguard undersea infrastructure, while others like Denmark adopt a more industry-led approach. However, to ensure digital resilience across the Alliance, there is a pressing need for a unified NATO approach to undersea cables.

Additionally, the EU needs to scale and speed up efforts at diversifying data routes connecting Europe to Asia, especially considering the demand for fast and reliable data is set to rise. In this regard, Brussels should collaborate more systematically with its Nordic members, namely Norway, Sweden, and Finland, to expedite various connectivity initiatives at laying undersea cables to connect Europe with Asia via the Arctic. While technically challenging and financially demanding, undersea cables passing through the Arctic offer several advantages. They are shorter and, therefore, faster than those passing through the Red Sea, less susceptible to damage by natural causes, and face fewer intentional threats due to the limited passage of vessels in the Arctic. Most importantly, transforming Northern Europe into a data hub presents the EU with a reliable alternative and represents a significant step toward enhancing digital security.","The article discusses the strategic importance of undersea cables and their vulnerabilities, directly mentioning 'undersea cables' and their potential for intentional damage.

It explores the implications of such damage for EU-Asia connectivity and the global economy, emphasizing the need for enhanced maritime security.

The central theme revolves around the risks associated with these cables, making it a substantial discussion on the topic of cut sea cables."

The dangerous mission of installing a listening device on that cable was given to the navy's most secretive and unusual submarine.

It’s 3am in the morning, and James Bradely – Director of Undersea Warfare at the Office of Naval Intelligence – is sitting in his office, deep in thought. The information he received did not specify the telephone line’s route, but Bradely had a strong hunch. The two naval bases were many thousands of miles apart by land, but only a few hundred miles by sea. It would make geographic and economic sense for the Russians to lay an underwater cable between the two bases rather than a much longer land line.

Bradley, who also served on a sub in the navy, was very familiar with the US submarine fleet and knew that there was only one sub capable of carrying out such an exceptional mission: a mission christened “Operation Ivy Bells.”

The USS Halibut was designed as a missile platform but was refitted for a different role: finding stuff underwater. In 1968, the Halibut underwent a complete overhaul, fitted with advanced technologies including a two-ton, video-camera equipped mini-sub called ‘The Fish.’ The Halibut’s advanced capabilities made it perfect for James Bradely’s plans, which involved covertly scanning the Russian coast for signs warning of underwater cables and attaching an electronic listening device to it.

This mission was extremely dangerous, requiring the Halibut to silently cross the Sea of Okhotsk, evading detection and sailing right up to the Soviet coastline.","The article discusses a historical operation involving the US Navy and the NSA to locate and tap into a Soviet underwater communication cable.

This week, several media reported that agents of the Russian intelligence reportedly went to Ireland to inspect the undersea cables.

The Sunday Times reported that Russian intelligence agents have been sent to Ireland to gather detailed information on the undersea cables that connect Europe to North America. The news is alarming, as intelligence agencies fear that Russia plans new cyber-espionage operations by tapping the undersea cables or even sabotaging them.

""Russia has sent intelligence agents to Ireland to map the precise location of the fibre-optic, ocean-bed cables that connect Europe to America, gardai suspect. This has raised concerns that Russian agents are checking the cables for weak points, with a view to tapping or even damaging them in the future,"" reported The Sunday Times.

Ireland is a strategic location for intercontinental communications, as it is where undersea cables carrying internet traffic connect to Europe.

Garda and military intelligence agencies believe the Russian agents were sent by the military intelligence branch of the Russian armed forces, the GRU. The same branch is suspected to have been involved in the poisoning of former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal.

The Russian spies were also seen monitoring Dublin Port, prompting local authorities to intensify controls at critical infrastructures along the Irish coast. Experts believe that Ireland is a privileged target for Russian intelligence due to its lack of counter-intelligence capability.

Attacks against undersea cables are not new; in 2014, The Register published information on a secret British spy base located in Oman that allows the British Government to tap various undersea cables. The documents revealed the existence of other spy bases involved in similar operations.

In June 2014, new reports based on documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that undersea cables have become integral to the global mass surveillance system operated by GCHQ, supported by British telecommunications firms.

The data collected from undersea cables includes content from online messages, browsing sessions, VOIP calls, and emails, with British telecommunications company Cable & Wireless playing a crucial role in these operations.

After learning that this year’s National History Day theme would revolve around communication, I knew that I wanted to cover something related to espionage during the Cold War. I was intending to create a project based around the various communication methods used by famous spies in order to communicate their findings to their mother nations, but that theme was scrapped early on due to the lack of information yielded by the research I had done. After days of thorough research, I came across some articles on Cold War wiretapping, which eventually led me to Operation Ivy Bells.

After discovering the initial articles on the subject, I began scouring Google for any information I could find about Operation Ivy Bells. As I collected resources, I noticed that a large amount of the information on the missions was still classified to the general public, and I found it increasingly difficult to find credible sources. Nevertheless, I continued my research on the topic and was able to find articles on the events of the campaign, blueprints for the submarines that were used during the operations, and even interviews with some of the divers that participated in the missions themselves. In the end, there was just enough information available to the public eye to enable me to create this project.

I decided early on that I would be working alone this year, so I eventually concluded that I would create a website. I had all of the necessary information available to me, so it was only a matter of learning how to use the NHD website builder and making the site look presentable. Using the works of previous NHD winners as examples, I was able to learn how the program worked through experimentation, trial and error, and various guidebooks. Through this, I was able to give my website a simplistic, yet professional aesthetic.

Operation Ivy Bells fit this year’s theme of “Communication in History” in that it deals with the interception and utilization of communicated information. By the time World War II ended, the two global superpowers that were still standing were suspicious of each other’s activities. The American government jumped at a chance to gain the upper hand over the Soviets, who were equally as afraid of another global conflict as the Americans were, and created Operation Ivy Bells as a means through which to gather information. Using wiretaps and highly advanced rebreather equipment, the U.S. government was able to uncover a treasure trove of private Soviet data, which was eventually used to help ease the tension between the rival nations. Operation Ivy Bells was important in that without it, the Cold War could have either lasted even longer than it already did, or escalated further into a worldwide conflict.

**THE COLD WAR**

With the end of World War II in 1945, only two global superpowers remained in the world: The United States of America, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Tensions rose between the two nations; the rival nations resorted to espionage campaigns, thus beginning “The Cold War”. As this passive-aggressive information war continued, both nations developed highly advanced methods of gathering, spreading, encrypting, and decrypting foreign intelligence.

**THESIS**

The United States espionage campaign known as Operation: Ivy Bells, in which wiretaps were secretly placed on Soviet undersea communication lines, gave the U.S. unencrypted information on Russian nuclear strike capabilities, which ultimately led to the completion of the SALT II Treaty and indirectly had a hand in ending the Cold War.

**A PERILOUS GAMBIT**

The combined efforts of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), United States Navy, and the National Security Agency (NSA) produced one of the most dangerous and ambitious covert submarine operations in history in an effort to gain the upper hand in the rapidly evolving information war.

In 1971, Captain James Bradley pitched his idea to intercept information from Soviet communication lines in the Sea of Okhotsk via wiretapping. The Soviet Navy had established a high-priority, nuclear-armed submarine base at Petropavlovsk on the Kamchatka Peninsula, and Bradley believed that there was a communication line that ran from the remote base to Moscow’s Pacific Fleet headquarters in Vladivostok, Russia. Targeting the Sea of Okhotsk was a high-risk gambit, as the Soviet Union had forbidden other vessels from entering through constant patrolling and underwater sound detection devices. Additionally, there was no clear-cut evidence that there was a cable there to begin with.

Nevertheless, the American intelligence agencies jumped at the chance of any advantage over their adversary, and began developing plans to wiretap the alleged Soviet communication lines. In 1972, Bradley dispatched the _U.S.S. Halibut_ to Kamchatka to find the Russian communication line. The team was able to narrow down their search time significantly thanks to posted signs on the Siberian coastline warning ships not to lay anchor. Equipped with heavily modified rebreather equipment, the specially-trained saturation divers plunged into the icy depths in search of the line. Despite the physical risks, they uncovered the 3-inch wide cables at approximately 400 feet below sea level, only 120 miles off the Russian coastline. After attaching the 20-foot-long listening and recording device, the _Halibut_ was able to eavesdrop on Soviet military information being sent between the two Navy bases completely undetected.

**AN INFORMATION GOLDMINE**

Through the raw, unencrypted tape recordings recovered by the _U.S.S Halibut_, the United States was able to gain knowledge of the Soviet’s nuclear strike capabilities and limitations, as well as the rival nation’s recent tactical movements, which allowed them to gain an informational advantage over the USSR.

After recording as much information as physically possible, the _Halibut_ returned to America. Upon receiving the tapes, NSA intelligence analyzed the recordings for vital information, and found that most of the sensitive details were completely unencrypted. The _Halibut_’s tapes proved to be invaluable in gaining the upper hand over the Soviets.

The Secret Mission to Tap Soviet Undersea Cables, Dark Docs

**SUCCESSFUL NEGOTIATIONS**

The United States was only able to successfully negotiate terms for strategic arms limitations with the USSR during the SALT II discussions because of the information obtained via wiretapping the Soviet’s communication lines.

From the Operation Ivy Bells tapes, government officials were able to glean a ground-breaking truth: The Soviets were just as afraid of war as them, equipping American negotiators to deal with Soviet affairs during the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT II).

Their primary goal was to ease tensions between the nations and prevent the further production of Multiple Independently Targeted Re-Entry Vehicles (MIRV) by either country. With the completion of the SALT II treaties, and the subsequent limitations on nuclear armaments resulting from the agreements, submarine espionage became more commonly utilized in the remaining years of the Cold War.

**A NEW AGE OF ESPIONAGE**

The success of Operation Ivy Bells encouraged the use of wiretapping throughout the rest of the Cold War and beyond, allowing the United States to gain an advantage over both the Russians and any other potential adversaries.

Operation Ivy Bells missions continued unearthing an information goldmine from the unprotected Soviet cables, and America began to utilize both submarines and wiretapping in foreign espionage campaigns more regularly. Four years after the first Ivy Bells mission, the _Halibut_ was decommissioned, and the _U.S.S. Seawolf_ and _U.S.S. Parche_ rose to take its place.

**A CRIPPLING BETRAYAL**

If not for the betrayal of Ronald Pelton, an NSA analyst turned Russian mole, Operation Ivy Bells would have continued its regular missions and provided the United States with even more information regarding Russian military movements.

In 1981, satellites depicted Russian warships escorting a salvage ship towards the location of the tapped cable in the Sea of Okhotsk. When _U.S.S. Parche_ was sent on one of its biannual missions to retrieve and repair the listening device, the divers discovered that the six-ton, twenty-foot-long wiretap had been removed. After the _Parche’s_ return to America, the NSA began an in-depth analysis of how the Soviets could have found out about Operation Ivy Bells.","The article discusses 'Operation Ivy Bells,' which involved wiretapping Soviet undersea communication lines, thus closely relating to the topic of cut sea cables.

Mare Island Naval Shipyard had a major, top-secret role during the Cold War, refitting submarines as spy ships that slipped undetected into coastal Russian waters and tapped undersea telephone cables in risky U.S. efforts to head off Soviet Union military threats.

There was little public awareness of the purpose of the shipyard work and missions of the Mare Island-based spy subs until 1998, two years after the shipyard’s closure, with the publication of *Blind Man’s Bluff*, The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage, written by Sherry Sontag and Christopher Drew. Since its printing, the book has been a staple for anyone interested in the U.S. Navy’s clandestine “silent service” activity.

Mare Island historian Dennis Kelly, writing about the spy submarines in 2015, said that starting in the early 1970s the shipyard was home to what was known as the Ocean Engineering Program, “one of the most highly classified and important programs in the history of the U.S. military.” Under the program, Kelly, who was a longtime shipyard employee, said nuclear subs were secretly modified for intelligence-gathering assignments that were successful “until the American traitor Ronald Pelton sold out his country to the Soviets for $35,000 in the early 1980s.”

Pelton, a National Security Agency employee for 14 years, was arrested in 1985 after a Russian defector told authorities Pelton had sold the Soviets information on U.S. intelligence efforts, including the code-named “Ivy Bells” submarine spying. Convicted and sentenced to life in prison with possible parole, he was released from federal custody in 2015.

Mare Island work included 1971 modifications to the USS Halibut (SSN-587) that included a fake deep-submergence rescue craft mounted on the vessel’s deck. Actually, it was a decompression chamber that enabled divers to work safely at extreme depths outside the sub. Their first job following the shipyard modifications was to utilize the chamber 400 feet down in the Sea of Okhotsk while tapping a telephone cable linking two Soviet naval bases.

Capt. James Bradley Jr., director of undersea warfare at the Office of Naval Intelligence, came up with the wiretap plan. As a boy, he had seen “Cable Crossing – Do Not Anchor” signs on the Mississippi River, and had a hunch that there would be similar signs along the Russian coast. It took more than a week for the Halibut, running at periscope depth, to spot such a sign on a desolate beach and then find and track the five-inch-diameter cable as it ran out to sea from that point. About 40 miles offshore, divers placed a 3-foot-long external device on the cable, and the eavesdropping success resulted in a second Halibut voyage in 1972 to place a larger tap. The second device, nearly 20 feet long and weighing about six tons, was able to monitor many more phone lines and operate for months at a time.

At the start of the first trip, Halibut skipper John McNish kept most of his crew in the dark about the cable-tapping plan. But as the sub left on the second run, McNish briefed the men on their mission and the risks they faced. He also told his men that black boxes filled with explosives had been placed at forward, aft and midship locations, wired for self-destruct. If trapped, the sub would not be boarded and the crew would not be taken alive.

The Halibut returned to the Okhotsk site in 1974 and 1975, and other submarines, including the Mare Island-based USS Seawolf (SSN-575) and USS Parche (SSN-683), followed the same course. The Parche placed another large tap close to the first device and both taps remained in place until 1982 when the Soviets, alerted to their location by Ronald Pelton’s information, fished them out. One of the taps, marked “Property of the United States,” wound up in a Moscow museum for several years.

The Parche managed to tap a similar cable in the Barents Sea, resulting in a treasure trove of Soviet voice and data transmissions described by CIA, NSA and Navy officials as “the crown jewels.” The sub made four more voyages to the Barents Sea, and the Barents cable provided intelligence throughout the Cold War, which officially ended in 1991 with the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

By the end of her 30-year, special-operations career, the Parche had become the most decorated vessel in the U.S. Navy. The sub’s awards included nine Presidential Unit Citations, 10 Navy Unit Commendations and 13 Expeditionary Medals.

Other submarines directly involved in special-ops spying include another Mare Island-based sub, the USS Richard B. Russell (SSN-687), and in recent years the USS Jimmy Carter (SSN-23), USS Connecticut (SSN-22), and a new USS Seawolf (SSN-21). Many other Navy subs have had tasks such as providing cover or serving as decoys during secret missions.

“The special fleet of submarines equipped to tap cables made it possible to listen as Soviet naval headquarters detailed day-to-day frustrations, critiqued missions, and reacted to fears of an American nuclear strike,” Sontag and Drew wrote in *Blind Man’s Bluff*. “At a point in time when both superpowers could start nuclear war with a push of a button, this was a rare and crucial look at who the adversary really was.”

“There was always a huge risk of a destabilizing incident, even the risk that a submarine might spark real battle,” the authors added. “But when the Navy and the intelligence agencies weighed the gains against the possibility of a violent response, they relied on one simple fact: the Soviets were sending out their spies as well.”

“Perhaps the entire nuclear arms race was insane, but once it existed, spy subs became a crucial part of dealing with that insanity.”

The rumors are that the Navy's newest nuclear sub, the [USS Jimmy Carter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Jimmy_Carter_\(SSN-23\)), has been [designed for spywork](http://http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/20/politics/20submarine.html), with a ""special capability... to tap undersea cables and eavesdrop on the communications passing through them,"" according to the AP.

The rumors are right, Military.com's undersea warfare experts believe. Here's what retired Rear Admiral Hank McKinney, the former commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet's submarine force, had to say:

> _The Navy has for years carried out special surveillance missions with nuclear submarines. Most of these missions utilized attack submarines that were not extensively modified. Specialized communications intercept equipment were installed in existing spaces on board these submarines. A few have been modified for special oceanographic missions and capabilities. In the past, these included USS HALIBUT, USS SEAWOLF, USS RICHARD B. RUSSELL, and USS PARCHE. Each of these submarines was modified to accommodate these new missions. **In the case of USS JIMMY CARTER, all of the modifications were made before the submarine was delivered to the Navy**. This submarine will be utilized to conduct many specialized missions, some of which will be routine unclassified oceanographic research operations which will advance our knowledge of the ocean. Some of the missions will be highly classified missions which I am unable to comment on._ (emphasis mine)

Undersea thriller author, submarine authority, and Military.com columnist [Joe Buff](http://www.joebuff.com/) notes that a [2001 _Wall Street Journal_ article](http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-529826.html?legacy=zdnn) unveiled the NSA's desire to tap undersea cables. ""It is reasonable to presume that [the ability] to do this underwater, by properly trained Navy divers, is now achievable,"" Buff writes.

> _Ironically, an earlier nuclear sub named USS Seawolf, commissioned in the 1950s, was secretly modified with a hull section that allowed saturation divers to work on the seafloor at considerable depths. (Saturation divers spend a long period living and resting in a shirtsleeves environment with a mixed-gas atmosphere pressurized to equal the depth of their job site. After days or even weeks of daily work shifts, they then undergo a long period of hyperbaric decompression to be able to return to sea-level air. France claimed several years ago to have had men in ""soft"" scuba outfits -- not hard exoskeleton suits -- perform useful manual tasks on the bottom at 3,000 feet.)  
> In my opinion USS Jimmy Carter is highly likely to include such facilities, essentially a modern-era Sea Lab built into the submarine itself._

Click [here](https://www.defensetech.org/archives/001397.html) for more, as Buff goes deep into mechanics of listening in on undersea chatter.

> _The issue of how to collect the tapped communications in real-time also isn't new. In addition to the undersea tap referenced in the [Journal] article, which by the way affected the Soviet Navy's Pacific Fleet headquarters and waters in the Sea of Okhotsk off the western Pacific, another tap was emplaced to listen in on Northern Fleet communications near Murmansk on the Kola Peninsula on the Barents Sea off of the North Atlantic -- this tap was not betrayed by the spy mentioned in the article, because he did not know about it. The idea was seriously discussed in the American intelligence and submarine community of laying an undersea cable from that tap to Iceland, using submarines and divers, so that a listening station could monitor the cable's message traffic continuously. Open sources state that this cable wasn't built, partly because the Cold War ended and the cost didn't seem justified.  
> However, with technology at least fifteen years more advanced now, it is quite possible that Carter can carry within her 100-foot long, 42-foot diameter special ""wasp waist"" hull section's ""garage space"" a considerable length of fiber optic cable. (Wasp waist refers to the narrow inner pressure hull, which allows for the ocean-interface garage space volume between the pressure hull and the outer hull that conforms to the overall streamlined teardrop shape of the vessel.)  
> This hypothetical cable need not be led up onto land in friendly turf for it to be useful. It need only establish enough ""stand-off distance"" from the tap, out into neutral or international waters, where various means of transmission of intercepts are more feasible without enemy detection or interference. These include a hard-wired or acoustic-link modem station that is monitored by submarines that deploy there in rotation for Indications and Warning missions. Or, as the article says, various radio buoy transmitters and other means could be used to continually relay intercepts on to the NSA for detailed analysis. Spread-spectrum or frequency agile, super high frequency (SHF) or extremely high frequency (EHF) transmitters, with very low probability of interception, mounted on low-observable buoys, constantly ""talking"" to U.S. spy satellites, are surely within current technical means if budgeting were available.  
> These transmitters could be powered for lengthy periods using the latest generation of fuel cell or semi fuel cell technology, some types of which are open to the sea and in fact use naturally circulating seawater as their electrolyte. Such radio buoy bandwidth would be adequate to convey information from a fiber optic cable, especially given mathematical data-compression techniques and artificial intelligence routines in an attached computer that could quickly ""learn"" which cable lines and which message traffic were truly of strategic interest to the United States. (A communications laser might be used instead of a radio, just as some submarine/satellite comms links now use laser beams.)  
> It is also worth noting that the garage space and ""people tank"" facilities within Carter's added hull section are almost certainly mission reconfigurable, that is, easily altered to serve different mission profiles. This is the case with the USS Virginia design, and it appears likely that the same new, hyper-flexible approach to submarine architecture was applied to Carter's special modifications; the design and construction work of the two overlapped, witness both ships being commissioned into the Navy in 2004/2005. Thus Carter is able to do many different and exciting things with her 50 commandoes, her garage space, and her ocean interface for deploying and retrieving unmanned (and autonomous?) undersea vehicles and perhaps also aerial vehicles._

Though the tactics and threat are reminiscent of the Cold War, the Russians appear to be taking a page out of the book that the U.S. Navy and the NSA wrote in the 1970s in a series of undersea wire-tapping missions that became known as Operation Ivy Bells.

Briefly mentioned in the Times report, Operation Ivy Bells is written about extensively in the book “Blind Man’s Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage” by Sherry Sontag and Christopher Drew. The missions used submarines to listen in on previously untapped Soviet “hard-lines” to glean information about Soviet ballistic missile submarine deployments and strategy.

In 1970, at the height of the Cold War, James Bradley, the director of undersea warfare at the Office of Naval intelligence dreamed up one of the most daring submarine spy missions in modern history. He wanted to send the specially outfitted 350ft nuclear-powered submarine, the _Halibut_, to land over the ocean floor under the Sea of Okhotsk and tap a phone line that connected the Soviet submarine base at Petropavlovsk to its Pacific Fleet headquarters near Vladivostok.

Besides the risk of international incident if _Halibut_ was caught or detected, there was no evidence that the phone line even existed. The only evidence that Bradley had was the notion that the sub base in Petropavlovsk was probably required to give constant updates back to its higher headquarters. So Bradley, sitting in his Pentagon office at 3 a.m., thought back to his childhood, racking his brain to figure out where the Soviets might have laid their cables.

According to “Blind Man’s Bluff,” Bradley, in his predawn stupor, recalled from his youth written signs that had been posted along the Mississippi River to mark undersea cables. The signs, posted along the shore, were meant to prevent passing from hooking the cables with their anchors.

With this in mind, Bradley reasoned that there had to be similar signs near the shallower points on the Sea of Okhotsk.

So, with Bradley’s childhood in mind, “the most daring acts of tele-piracy of the Cold War” was born.

After an extensive multi-year refit that began in the late 60s, _Halibut_ was ready to depart from Mare Island Naval Shipyard outside of San Francisco for Okhotsk in 1972. One of the sub’s most noticeable additions was a giant hump mounted behind its conning tower, a hump that was publicly declared as a hangar for a deep sea rescue vehicle but was actually a “decompression and lockout chamber” for the team of divers that would exit the sub to tap the Soviet cables.

So in October 1972, the crew of _Halibut_ made its way across the Pacific, its older nuclear reactor pushing her across the sea at just over 10 knots. First the spy sub moved north to the Aleutian Islands, then past the Bering Straight and into the Sea of Okhotsk. The captain of the _Halibut_, Navy Cmdr. Jack McNish, had not told the crew where it was going—only that they were leaving home for three months and that they were searching for the remnants of a new Soviet infrared anti-ship missile that the United States was desperately seeking a counter-measure for.

Once inside the Sea of Okhotsk, the _Halibut_ slowly patrolled with its periscope up, scanning the coastline for Bradley’s signage that would mark the cables. And then, after a week of patrolling with no luck, the _Halibut_ found a sign on the northern shore of the Sea of Okhotsk that said something to the extent of “Do Not Anchor. Cable Here” in Russian.

The _Halibut_, after locating the sign, launched a specially designed submersible or “fish,” that then proceeded to search for the cables. The fish had a very basic video camera, and a higher definition camera. While the video was relayed in real-time back to the submarine, the film from the camera had to be retrieved from the fish and subsequently developed while the _Halibut_ was near the surface so that the sub’s dark room could properly vent or “snorkel” the chemicals used to develop the film.

Hours after the fish’s launch, footage began to come back of foot-long bumps in the sand, a sort of Morse code etched in the sea bottom. The _Halibut_ had found the cables.

According to “Blind Man’s Bluff,” the fish was then retrieved and the film developed, revealing the Soviet cables strewn along the seafloor.

After identifying the cables, McNish maneuvered the _Halibut_ well outside the 3-mile territorial limit of the Soviet Union and located a spot just above the cable where he could lower the submarine’s two massive anchors in a sort-of hover.

Using specially designed rubber wet suits that fit loosely and were pumped full of hot water to counter the freezing temperatures of the Sea of Okhotsk, the divers departed the _Halibut_ armed with pneumatic air-guns to blow debris off the cables and emergency oxygen bottles in case their “umbilical cords” that connected them back to _the Halibut_ were severed.

The wire-tap, according to “Blind Man’s Bluff,” was three-feet long and composed of a tape recorder and a lithium ion battery. A connector would wrap around the cable and draw out the words and data through induction. There was no cutting into the cable.

For the next few hours the recording device attached to the cable relayed Soviet communications back to a select group of spies aboard the _Halibut_ who would then, after the completion of the mission and a successful return to port, send the tapes to Fort Meade, Md, where they would be subsequently analyzed.

With the tap successful, the _Halibut_ then moved to its secondary mission of locating the Soviet missile fragments before returning to port. With the mission a success, Bradley saw a future filled with taps around the globe that could record for months and years continuously, without the presence of an American sub to collect the data.

In August 1972, the _Halibut_ departed once more for the Sea of Okhotsk to repeat the tap. This time, however, the sub was rigged with explosives in case the sub and her crew were ever compromised. This time too, according to Blind Man’s Bluff, McNish told his crew about their actual mission and the risks it entailed.

In the years following more submarines would be outfitted like _Halibut_, and they too would conduct similar wire-taps. Operation Ivy Bells had begun.","The article discusses Russian submarines operating near vital undersea cables, highlighting concerns about their potential severing during conflicts.

Russia has been accused of handing out phone chargers and USB drives to G20 leaders that were capable of stealing data from phones and computers.

China has been accused of putting bugs in irons and kettles that are sent to Russia and the US National Security Agency has been accused of wiretapping the pope.

However, these pale in comparison to some of the audacious peacetime plots to get information that have emerged from the shadowy world of espionage.

At the height of the cold war, the National Security Agency, CIA and the US Navy collaborated to tap into underwater communication lines used by the Soviet Union.

They discovered an undersea cable that connected the Soviet Pacific Fleet’s headquarters at Vladivostok with a submarine base at Petropavlovsk.

Sailing deep into Soviet territorial waters in 1971, the US sent a specially modified submarine USS Halibut into the Sea of Okhotsk to examine the cable.

Divers found it under 400 feet of water and installed a device that wrapped around the cable to record all communications that passed through it.

Once a month divers retrieved the recordings and installed new tapes. It proved so successful that other taps were placed on other Soviet communication lines around the world.

The operation continued until 1981 when a bankrupt NSA agent sold details of the operation to the Soviets.

This joint operation between the CIA and the British Secret Intelligence Service was again an attempt to tap into communications by the Soviet Military.

In 1953, a time of high tension between the powers controlling east and west Berlin, a warehouse with a deep basement was constructed in the American sector of the divided city.

The CIA had heard of a crucial telephone junction close to the border of the American sector where three cables came together.

Striking out to reach this small target, which ran just a few inches below a busy street, a 1,500 feet long tunnel was dug from the warehouse basement, running under the most heavily patrolled border at the time.

They intersected the cables to tap into the wires, allowing them to listen to the communications between the Soviet headquarters in Berlin and Moscow.

Although they were unable to break the Soviet encryption, a faint electronic echo produced by the Soviet communication equipment allowed them to obtain the information in plain text.

The Soviets claim to have known about the tunnel all along after being tipped off by a mole in the British intelligence service.

The Soviets “discovered” the tunnel in 1956 when soldiers broke into the eastern end.

Rather than relying on modern eavesdropping, this operation used old fashioned infiltration.

Recruited while at Cambridge University by Russian spy Arnold Deutsch, Kim Philby, Donald Maclean, Guy Burgess and Anthony Blunt rose to become a ring of highly placed spies in the British establishment.

Philby joined MI6, MacLean worked at the Foreign Office, Burgess at the BBC and later MI6 and Blunt worked for MI5.

They all passed information to the Soviet Union. Philby is perhaps the most notorious, having risen to be chief British intelligence representative in Washington.

He helped alert MacLean and Burgess that they had been exposed, allowing them to escape to Moscow. Philby himself later defected.

A fifth spy John Cairncross, who worked at the Foreign Office, has also been claimed as being a member of the Cambridge spy ring.

During 1976, the KGB managed to install miniaturised eavesdropping equipment and transmitters inside 16 IBM Selectric Typewriters used by staff at the US embassy in Moscow and consulate in Leningrad.

These copied everything that was typed into the machines and then transmitted the data in bursts to KGB engineers in vans nearby.

The bursts were too short to be detected by the Us counter surveillance equipment and were set n the same frequency band as the Soviet television stations.

For eight years the Soviet spy agency was able to steal American secrets from inside the heart of the US embassy.

The bugs were only discovered in 1984 by an operation conducted by the National Security Agency when it sent a team of experts to scour the embassy for bugs.

Over 100 days every piece of electronic equipment, communications device, printers and computers were replaced while the old equipment was taken back to the US to be X-rayed.

Some of the bugs operated on batteries and others used mains electricity.

The bugs were also remote controlled so they could be turned off when inspection teams were in the area.

An NSA report that was later released concluded that the Soviets had been able to read every single document written on these typewriters.

They never discovered how the bugs were installed, but suspected they were installed by the KGB when the typewriters were passing through Soviet customs.

Germany may have been the victim off NSA eavesdropping, but its own Federal Intelligence Service, the Bundesnachrichtendienst, has also engaged in such activities.

In 2008 it was found to have illicitly monitored the entire computer network at the Afghan Ministry of Commerce and Industry.

Using software known as a Trojan horse, the German spy agency were able to get hold of the login details for the personal Yahoo email account of Amin Farhang, the Afghani Commerce Minister.

Over several months during 2006 German spies were able to access his emails and those of a journalist at the newspaper Der Speigel.

It later emerged that the agency had been able to access the entire computer network at the ministry.

In 2011 a hacking group also announced it had discovered another Trojan horse that was being used to monitor Skype conversations.

In a modern version of the dead letter drop, British spies working out of the embassy in Russia used a transmitter concealed in an artificial rock to pass classified data.

The rock was planted near a tree on a street on the outskirts of Moscow.

Information was transferred wirelessly to a memory device inside the fake rock by Russian assets using palm-sized devices as they walked past.

Later British diplomats from the embassy would collect the information by again walking past with a wireless device or even taking away the rock.

Russia exposed the plot and broadcast images of British diplomats repeatedly walking past the rock and picking it up on television.

The FSB, the Russian intelligence service, also released close up photographs and x-ray images of a hollowed out rock filled with circuitry.

They published photographs of four alleged British agents and a Russian accused of sending information to the rock.

The plot seemed to be far fetched enough to be worth of a James Bond film and Q. Britain initially laughed it off and denied the accusations.

However, Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair's chief of staff, later admitted that the episode was in fact true.

Acoustic Kitty was a top secret 1960s CIA project attempting to use cats in spy missions, intended to spy on the Kremlin and Soviet embassies.

In an hour-long procedure, a veterinary surgeon transformed the furry feline into an elite spy, implanting a microphone in her ear canal and a small radio transmitter at the base of her skull.

The first Acoustic Kitty mission was to eavesdrop on two men in a park outside the Soviet compound on Wisconsin Avenue in Washington, D.C.

It cost nearly $20 million in surgical and training expenses, however the feline was hit and killed by a taxi almost immediately after being let out on her first job.","The article discusses operations where undersea cables were tapped for espionage during the Cold War.

These cables use fiber optics to move data at high speeds to land, where the data is then conveyed via fiber optics to homes and businesses.

Yet, despite the billions of people relying on the data moved by undersea cables, there are only about 380 of them worldwide as of 2019, according to CNN estimates, though they span more than 745,000 miles—or more than three times the distance to the moon.

Given the sheer scope of undersea cables, which often span entire oceans, _The New York Times_ estimates an individual undersea cable project can cost up to $350 million. That is why these cables have historically been laid by global telecommunications firms with the deep pockets and technical expertise necessary to undertake these projects. However, tech companies are increasingly dominating both the use and implementation of undersea cables.

“Some of the main investors in new cables now are Google and Facebook,” says Alan Maudlin, research director at TeleGeography, a telecommunications research firm, because tech giants are increasingly the ones using all that undersea bandwidth.

When it comes to global bandwidth usage, just a handful of services account for more than a third of all bandwidth, according to research from network intelligence company Sandvine. The company’s Global Internet Phenomena Report identifies Web-based media streaming, Netflix, and YouTube as the top three users of global traffic, comprising 34.1% of traffic as of September 2019. Facebook is also in the top 10.

Tech giants like Google (which owns YouTube) and Facebook “have surpassed Internet backbone providers—the traditional telecom carriers—as the largest users of international capacity,” according to TeleGeography. The firm estimates the amount of international capacity deployed by tech companies grew eight times from 2014 to 2018.

These undersea cables connect almost the entire globe. Google is a part or sole owner of 15 different undersea cables, with end points terminating in places that include Chile and France. Facebook is a major capacity buyer or part owner of 10 cables with end points in Singapore, China, and the U.S. (among other countries). Amazon is part owner or a major capacity buyer of five cables, with end points in countries that include Malaysia. Microsoft is part owner or a major capacity buyer of four different cables, with end points in countries that include Spain.

One of the fastest undersea cables in operation today is the Marea cable, partially owned by Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook. It transmits data at 160 terabits per second, which is “16 million times faster than the average home Internet connection,” says Microsoft. The Marea cable has enough capacity to “stream 71 million high-definition videos simultaneously,” according to the company.

Despite this ongoing change in cable dominance, undersea cables often force traditional telecoms and the new guard of tech giants to play nice.

The Marea cable is the result of a partnership between Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, and Telxius, a spinoff that manages telecom infrastructure for multinational telecom Telefonica. That is because advanced cables like Marea are critical to meeting rising demand from the consumers and businesses both telecoms and tech giants serve.

“Marea comes at a critical time,” says Microsoft president Brad Smith. “Submarine cables in the Atlantic already carry 55% more data than transpacific routes, and 40% more data than between the U.S. and Latin America.” Smith says there is “no question” demand for transAtlantic data flows will increase.

“Only Google has built/funded cables themselves, but even these cables are used by other parties besides Google,” says Maudlin. “For example, the new Dunant cable [owned by Google] between the U.S. and France will have a fiber pair used by the French carrier Orange.”

Tech giants may battle each other for Internet dominance, all while replacing old guard telecoms, but when it comes to laying undersea cable, playing nice seems to be the order of the day.

### More Fibers in More Places

Companies may collaborate to build undersea cable networks, but they still must defend these networks from threats. Damage to a single cable can cause widespread disruption. In fact, the potential for cable outages was actually the reason Microsoft helped to create the super-fast Marea cable.

In 2012, Hurricane Sandy (also known as Superstorm Sandy) hit the east coast of the U.S., inflicting nearly $70 billion in damage to the infrastructure of New York and New Jersey. In addition to the homes and businesses damaged, the storm also damaged the places where undersea cables came ashore, causing service disruptions. Microsoft learned the hard way that New York and New Jersey were home to an unnaturally high convergence of undersea cables making landfall.

That made Microsoft think differently about potential dangers to undersea cables, both below the surface and on land. Today, the Marea cable makes landfall in the U.S. much further south, in Virginia Beach, VA, to avoid disruption if New York or New Jersey ever get hit by a storm of Sandy’s magnitude again.

Being more strategic about where cables make landfall certainly helps. So does building the cables to withstand physical damage and destruction. The fiber optics of undersea cables are wrapped in protective material to withstand harsh underwater environments, natural disasters like submarine earthquakes, and man-made damage from fishing boats and anchors.

Typically, “the fibers are wrapped in urethane and wrapped in copper and wrapped again in urethane,” said Byron Clatterbuck, CEO of international telecom company Seacom. The urethane protects the optical fibers, and the copper conducts electricity that powers repeaters designed to regenerate the signal regularly through the cable. Depending on the environment, cables may also be sheathed in extra protective material, such as iron or steel.

The number of undersea cables being laid is increasing to meet demand, but cables still take years and millions of dollars to lay, which puts a ceiling on how many companies can lay cable at a time to expand global bandwidth. That fact has companies exploring ways to get more out of each cable laid.

“One key development is space-division multiplexing,” says Maudlin. “It’s basically a method to increase the number of [spatially distinct] channels that can be put in a single fiber. Google is using this in their new Dunant cable between France and the U.S.”

Dunant, which Google says is scheduled to go live this year, will use space-division multiplexing to provide transmission capacity of 250 terabits of data per second. The search giant says that is enough bandwidth to “transmit the entire digitized Library of Congress three times every second.”

In the case of Dunant, which Google is building in tandem with telecom SubCom LLC, the companies are using an approach to space-division multiplexing in which the cable doubles the fiber pairs used from six pairs to 12. The power transmitted across the original six pairs would now be split, resulting in a “two-thirds capacity increase,” according to Georg Mohs, CTO of SubCom LLC.

The technologies incorporated into newer cables like Dunant will make older cables look like dinosaurs—and cause them to go extinct.

“New cables have higher potential capacities than older cables,” says Maudlin. “Eventually older cables, especially those built pre-2003, will be decommissioned as they become economically obsolete compared to higher-capacity cables.”

However, older cables do not always make it to a peaceful retirement. Natural and man-made events can damage or destroy undersea cables.

“Cables routinely have faults all over the world each week,” says Maudlin. He cites some of the primary causes of damage as fishing and anchors. Underwater earthquakes and landslides also can destroy or disrupt undersea cables, he says.

Cable disruption also can affect military operations, as occurred in 2008, when three of the world’s largest undersea cables, in the Mediterranean Sea, were severed by accident. The incident was described in a report by U.K. think tank Policy Exchange that observed, “In a matter of hours, disruptions to regional connectivity had knocked out 80% of the connectivity between Europe and the Middle East,” including communications for American and British military forces in Iraq that were enabled by these cables.

That incident suggests another potential danger to undersea cables: intentional sabotage. Coordinated cable destruction, notes Policy Exchange, could cause major disruptions that target specific nations. For example, cutting just three cables would cause India to lose 70% of its data traffic with Europe. “Cables are not only easily cut, but maps providing the exact locations of all the world’s commercial cabling are freely available in the public domain.”

In mid-2019, a fire broke out on a Russian AS-12 nuclear-powered submarine, killing 14 sailors. It was a tragedy, to be sure. However, the incident also put U.S. officials on edge; they claimed the submarine’s real mission before the fire broke out was to cut undersea cables to disrupt or intercept communications.","The article 'How the Internet Spans the Globe' discusses undersea cables extensively, including their significance in global communications and the implications of their damage.

The Russian research vessel Yantar is shown docked in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Russian ships are skulking around underwater communications cables, worrying the U.S. and its allies the Kremlin might be taking information warfare to new depths.  

WASHINGTON (AP) — Russian ships are skulking around underwater communications cables, causing the U.S. and its allies to worry the Kremlin might be taking information warfare to new depths.  

Is Moscow interested in cutting or tapping the cables? Does it want the West to worry it might? Is there a more innocent explanation? Unsurprisingly, Russia isn’t saying.  

But whatever Moscow’s intentions, U.S. and Western officials are increasingly troubled by their rival’s interest in the 400 fiber-optic cables that carry most of the world’s calls, emails, and texts, as well as $10 trillion worth of daily financial transactions.  

“We’ve seen activity in the Russian navy, and particularly undersea in their submarine activity, that we haven’t seen since the ’80s,” Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of the U.S. European Command, told Congress this month.  

Without undersea cables, a bank in Asian countries couldn’t send money to Saudi Arabia to pay for oil. U.S. military leaders would struggle to communicate with troops fighting extremists in Afghanistan and the Middle East. A student in Europe wouldn’t be able to Skype his parents in the United States.  

All this information is transmitted along tiny glass fibers encased in undersea cables that, in some cases, are little bigger than a garden hose. All told, there are 620,000 miles of fiber-optic cable running under the sea, enough to loop around the earth nearly 25 times.  

Most lines are owned by private telecommunications companies, including giants like Google and Microsoft. Their locations are easily identified on public maps, with swirling lines that look like spaghetti. While cutting one cable might have limited impact, severing several simultaneously or at choke points could cause a major outage.  

The Russians “are doing their homework and, in the event of a crisis or conflict with them, they might do rotten things to us,” said Michael Kofman, a Russian military expert at nonprofit research group CNA Corp.  

It’s not Moscow’s warfighting ships and submarines that are making NATO and U.S. officials uneasy. It’s Russia’s Main Directorate of Deep Sea Research, whose specialized surface ships, submarines, underwater drones, and mini subs conduct reconnaissance, underwater salvage, and other work.  

One ship run by the directorate is the Yantar. It’s a modest, 354-foot oceanographic vessel that holds a crew of about 60. It most recently was off South America’s coast helping Argentina search for a lost submarine.  

Parlamentskaya Gazeta, the Russian parliament’s publication, last October said the Yantar has equipment “designed for deep-sea tracking” and “connecting to top-secret communication cables.” The publication said that in September 2015, the Yantar was near Kings Bay, Georgia, home to a U.S. submarine base, “collecting information about the equipment on American submarines, including underwater sensors and the unified (U.S. military) information network.” Rossiya, a Russian state TV network, has said the Yantar can not only connect to top-secret cables, but could cut them and “jam underwater sensors with a special system.”  

Russia’s Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.  

There is no hard evidence that the ship is engaged in nefarious activity, said Steffan Watkins, an information technology security consultant in Canada tracking the ship. But he wonders what the ship is doing when it’s stopped over critical cables or when its Automatic Identification System tracking transponder isn’t on.  

Of the Yantar’s crew, he said: “I don’t think these are the actual guys who are doing any sabotage. I think they’re laying the groundwork for future operations.”  

Members of Congress are wondering, too.  

Rep. Joe Courtney, a Connecticut Democrat on a House subcommittee on sea power, said of the Russians, “The mere fact that they are clearly tracking the cables and prowling around the cables shows that they are doing something.”  

Democratic Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, an Armed Services Committee member, said Moscow’s goal appears to be to “disrupt the normal channels of communication and create an environment of misinformation and distrust.”  

The Yantar’s movements have previously raised eyebrows.  

On Oct. 18, 2016, a Syrian telecom company ordered emergency maintenance to repair a cable in the Mediterranean that provides internet connectivity to several countries, including Syria, Libya, and Lebanon. The Yantar arrived in the area the day before the four-day maintenance began. It left two days before the maintenance ended. It’s unknown what work it did while there.  

Watkins described another episode on Nov. 5, 2016, when a submarine cable linking Persian Gulf nations experienced outages in Iran. Hours later, the Yantar left Oman and headed to an area about 60 miles west of the Iranian port city of Bushehr, where the cable runs ashore. Connectivity was restored just hours before the Yantar arrived on Nov. 9. The boat stayed stationary over the site for several more days.  

Undersea cables have been targets before.  

At the beginning of World War I, Britain cut a handful of German underwater communications cables and tapped the rerouted traffic for intelligence. In the Cold War, the U.S. Navy sent American divers deep into the Sea of Okhotsk off the Russian coast to install a device to record Soviet communications, hoping to learn more about the USSR’s submarine-launched nuclear capability.  

More recently, British and American intelligence agencies have eavesdropped on fiber optic cables, according to documents released by Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor.  

In 2007, Vietnamese authorities confiscated ships carrying miles of fiber optic cable that thieves salvaged from the sea for profit. The heist disrupted service for several months. And in 2013, Egyptian officials arrested three scuba divers off Alexandria for attempting to cut a cable stretching from France to Singapore. Five years on, questions remain about the attack on a cable responsible for about a third of all internet traffic between Egypt and Europe.  

Despite the relatively few publicly known incidents of sabotage, most outages are due to accidents.  

Two hundred or so cable-related outages take place each year. Most occur when ship anchors snap cables or commercial fishing equipment snags the lines. Others break during tsunamis, earthquakes, and other natural disasters.  

But even accidental cuts can harm U.S. military operations.  

In 2008 in Iraq, unmanned U.S. surveillance flights nearly screeched to a halt one day at Balad Air Base not because of enemy mortar attacks or dusty winds. An anchor had snagged a cable hundreds of miles away from the base, situated in the “Sunni Triangle” northwest of Baghdad.  

The severed cable had linked controllers based in the United States with unmanned aircraft flying intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions for coalition forces in the skies over Iraq, explained Ret. Air Force Col. Dave Lujan of Hampton, Virginia.

At the beginning of the 1970s, divers from the specially equipped submarine, USS Halibut (SSN 587), left their decompression chamber to start a bold and dangerous mission, codenamed ""Ivy Bells.""  
Nearly 400 feet beneath the frigid waters of the Sea of Okhotsk, deep inside Soviet territorial waters, the divers stayed alive only by the umbilical cords that pumped warm water into their dive suits.  
In an effort to alter the balance of the Cold War, these men scoured the ocean floor for a five-inch diameter cable carrying secret Soviet communications between military bases.  
Capt. James Bradley conceived the mission and firmly believed that he could find the tiny Soviet cable under the immense expanse of the ocean. Bradley remembered the signs that he saw during his childhood along the Mississippi River, warning boaters not to anchor near cables. He rationalized that the Soviets would use similar signs and lead him right to his target. Bradley's theory proved correct when the Halibut located a series of such signs in the Northern part of the Sea of Okhotsk, after an arduous search.  
The divers found the cable and installed a 20-foot-long listening device on it. Designed to attach to the cable without piercing the casing, the device recorded all communications that occurred. If the cable malfunctioned and the Soviets raised it for repair, the bug, by design, would fall to the bottom of the ocean. Each month, Navy divers retrieved the recordings and installed a new set of tapes.  
Upon their return to the United States, intelligence agents from the National Security Agency (NSA) analyzed the recordings and tried to decipher any encrypted information. The Soviets apparently were confident in the security of their communications lines, as a surprising amount of sensitive information traveled through the lines without encryption.  
The Americans continued their operations undetected until 1981, when one day, surveillance satellites showed a number of Soviet warships, including a salvage ship, anchored over the undersea cable. Another intelligence-capable submarine, USS Parche (SSN-683), was quickly sent to the site to retrieve the pod. Unable to find the tap, the Parche's divers realized that the Soviets had discovered the operation. The submarine made it back to the United States safely, leaving American leaders to determine how the Soviets had suddenly detected the tap.  
After a long probe, U.S. counterintelligence agents determined an NSA employee, Ronald Pelton, betrayed Operation Ivy Bells to the Soviets. He sold the secret of Operation Ivy Bells for $35,000, which ended nearly a decade of espionage. Pelton was later convicted and sentenced to life in prison. The original tap that was discovered by the Soviets is now on exhibit at the KGB museum in Moscow.","The article discusses Operation Ivy Bells, which involved locating and tapping into a Soviet undersea cable used for military communications.

The growth of global Internet traffic has driven a drastic expansion of the submarine cable network, both in terms of the sheer number of links and its total capacity. Today, a complex mesh of hundreds of cables, stretching over one million kilometres, connects nearly every corner of the earth and is instrumental in closing the remaining connectivity gaps. Despite the scale and critical role of the submarine network for both business and society at large, our community has mostly ignored it, treating it as a black box in most Internet studies, from connectivity to inter-domain traffic and reliability.

While there are benefits to this kind of abstraction, particularly for application developers, it does create roadblocks for network operators and researchers trying to gain insights into the underlying infrastructure. Both groups rely on diagnostic and measurement tools, such as traceroute, that record observations at the network layer. Despite their undeniable value, the level of abstraction at which they work means that multiple network operators sharing the same physical path may appear as distinct paths at the network layer.

Internet topologists have come up with ways to use these measurement tools to create different visualizations that represent the paths of the Internet. They comprise tens of thousands of networks with even more connections between them.

In reality, a failure in one piece of infrastructure could result in simultaneous failures in many seemingly disparate IP connections. With approximately 400 submarine cables being responsible for carrying 99% of transoceanic traffic, a relatively small number of conduits (with long repair times) bear a lot of responsibility for ensuring global bandwidth and connectivity. Simultaneous outages on just a few of these links can result in large regions being cut off entirely from the Internet. This difference between what our tools reveal and the underlying infrastructure can lead us to overestimate the network’s resiliency.

We first became interested in this area a few years back when looking at the connectivity of Cuba. We noticed four different networks being used to access the island – Tata, Telefonica, and two satellite providers. By examining our latency measurements, we knew that Tata and Telefonica were sending traffic via submarine cables instead of a satellite connection. However, both operators shared a single cable (ALBA-1) to reach the island, so relying solely on IP-level measurements would have led us to overestimate the number of physical paths by a factor of two. Most submarine cables are shared by many more than two providers.

When we first started discussing our research with the community, we found that there was a lot of interest from organizations aiming to operate reliable services over the Internet but did not have the global presence of larger networks like those of Google, Amazon, Microsoft, or Facebook. Organizations using these smaller networks want to ensure that if they are hiring another transit provider to improve reliability that it will actually lead to an increase in redundancy. While a second operator may help protect against certain types of issues (that is, non-physical faults such as configuration issues), cable faults will affect both operators.

At the moment, we are working on a service that will take an Internet path (a series of IP addresses such as the output of traceroute), and tag hops with possible submarine cables, identifying the most likely cable. We hope that eventually operators will be able to use this service to evaluate the path independence of their transit providers.

Being able to accurately tag an IP hop to a physical cable is not an easy process. Using over 500 million traceroutes, collected by the RIPE Atlas project, as well as using RIPE’s geolocation service, we were able to calculate whether it was physically possible for IP hops to traverse known submarine cables. We are also working to correlate cable outage and reconfiguration information to improve the accuracy and completeness of our data.

While there are faults and outages in terrestrial settings that can result in performance degradation or disconnections for large groups of users, the impact of submarine cable outages can be particularly devastating. First, relative to terrestrial networks, an even larger population — in some cases, entire economies — rely on a smaller number of conduits for connectivity.

Additionally, performance degradation caused by rerouting traffic can be even more extreme. In multiple cases in our study, we saw latency measurements between two regions increase more than threefold. Finally, depending on where the cable fault occurs and ship schedules, repair times can be measured in weeks. Though outages occur more frequently on land, the impact in terms of performance, the number of impacted users, and the repair times are more distressing.

One of the reasons why organizations like Microsoft and Google are investing in submarine infrastructure is due to a lack of reliability. While there are many additional motivations, such as better control over the network, higher reliability and predictability seem to be a critical factor. Smaller organizations without the resources to invest in their own submarine infrastructure may be interested in better information and subsea cable operators working to improve their service reliability.

While preventing submarine outages is a high bar, we can certainly gain a better understanding of critical infrastructure and recurrent problems with a more systemic perspective. While we have come across various reports of previous outages, a more complete compilation of outages that we can cross reference with other data sets covering natural disasters (such as earthquakes), ship routes, and cable repair times will allow us to more accurately assess the likelihood and potential impact of prolonged outages. It will also aid in identifying specific regions and cables where further investment may be the most beneficial.

Technological competition between the United States and China is transforming the physical connections that make up the digital world and its governance. China’s “Belt and Road Initiative” eventually incorporated digital connectivity under the rubric Digital Silk Road in an effort to leverage Beijing’s technological footprint globally. By developing bilateral and multilateral cooperation in areas such as cross-border optical fibre networks, satellite tracking ground stations, data centres, 5G network services and other initiatives, China’s President Xi Jinping claims that the Digital Silk Road offers an inclusive digital economy for all.

But contrary to Xi’s claims, the expansion of undersea cable networks across the Indo-Pacific region under the Digital Silk Road offers distinct advantages to China far more than bridging digital gaps. This includes accessing a large pool of foreign data, facilitating the expansion of Chinese technology corporations in the region, and strengthening China’s influence over global technology standards regimes.

Chinese technology corporation Huawei Marine Networks (now rebranded as HMN Technologies) is at the forefront of advancing the construction of undersea cable networks in the Indo-Pacific. According to the Submarine Almanac report 2023, HMN Technologies was involved in 16 undersea cable projects, which are collectively worth US$1.6 billion, across 27 countries in the region. Another report from the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) claims Beijing to have completed 11 undersea cable projects in Indonesia, seven in South Korea and six in the United Arab Emirates. In roughly the past decade, HMN Technologies has completed 108 projects laying down 60,000 kilometres of undersea cable, a total that is roughly one-and-a-half times the distance around Earth at the equator. Thanks to considerable patronage from the Chinese state, HMN Technologies has emerged as the fastest growing subsea cable builder over the past decade, ranking the company as the world’s fourth largest corporation involved in the submarine cable industry after SubCom (United States), Alcatel Submarine Network (France) and NEC (Japan).

The protection of undersea cables is a grey area under international law, and China has shown itself to be adept at exploiting the grey zone.

Reuters news agency has also reported that another three of China’s big technology corporations – China Telecom, China Unicom and China Mobile – are investing US$500 million to build a subsea cable network traversing through Europe, the Middle East and Asia.

The expansion of Chinese companies in undersea cable networks would be less remarkable if not for simmering regional tension about China’s actions. Control over data transmission lines leads to inevitable concern about China’s potential to conduct military espionage activities, or for the cables themselves to become a point of contest.

In February last year, for example, Chinese vessels disrupted two undersea cables connected to Taiwan’s Matsu Island, leaving residents without internet connectivity. While the incident was said to be unintentional, it demonstrated China’s capability to harm Taiwan’s digital security in the event of military conflict. A Chinese vessel was also blamed for severing fibre optic cables in the Baltic sea last year.

China is acting to ensure its own connectivity. China has gained permanent access to landing stations across the Indo-Pacific, such as the Pakistan and East Africa Connecting Europe (PEACE) cable, worth US$425 million, owned by China-ASEAN Information Harbor Co, PEACE Cable International Network and Telecom Egypt, spanning Pakistan, Egypt, Maldives, Cyprus, Seychelles and Djibouti. But these also provide a redundancy in case of disputes elsewhere, in particular the South China Sea. China, under the guise of its disputed nine-dash line claim, has already withheld permits for companies seeking undersea cable projects, such as the experience with Sea-Me-We.

The protection of undersea cables is a grey area under international law, and China has shown itself to be adept at exploiting the grey zone. It is important for the international community to agree on legal mechanisms to safeguard undersea cables, whether controlled by Chinese companies or any other.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, including direct references to incidents involving disruptions caused by Chinese vessels, which directly relate to the topic of cut sea cables.

An audacious plan allowed the U.S. to wiretap a secret Soviet undersea communication cable for almost ten years.

To ensure that their sovereignty wasn’t violated, the Soviet Navy installed a network of sound detection devices on the seafloor that was designed to detect intruders.

His first challenge was to find a way to pay for a mission to find and tap the cable. In 1970, the U.S. Navy was working on a deep-submergence rescue vehicle (DSRV) program, which was a vehicle that could rescue submariners in the event of an accident. The Navy diverted funds from this program, and outfitted the Halibut with something that looked like a DSRV vehicle, but was actually what’s known as a diver lockout, and was called the “Bat Cave”.

Bradley’s second challenge was to figure out a way for divers to stay at a depth of 400 feet for the several hours that it would take to install a wiretap on the cable. His answer was helium.

Instead of breathing nitrogen, participants in Operation Ivy Bells would breathe helium along with oxygen. This was one of the first uses of saturation diving. Because helium has a lower molecular weight than nitrogen, it exits human tissues more quickly, making it perfect for the task.

Bradley’s third challenge was finding the Soviet cable in over 600,000 square miles of water. The answer came to him while he was remembering his boyhood on the Mississippi River. He remembered signs being posted on the shore warning boaters not to anchor because there were utility lines at the bottom of the river. Bradley reasoned that if they used those signs in America, the Russians would use something similar.

Sure enough, when Halibut reached the Sea of Okhotsk in October 1971, her sailors scanned the shoreline and found signs warning fishermen to avoid the area where the cable was sunk. Once the search area was narrowed, it took just a few days to find the cable.

Bradley’s fourth challenge was how to actually tap into the cable without shorting it out. His answer was induction. A 20-foot long device was designed to wrap around the 5-inch-wide cable without piercing its casing. The device was designed to automatically fall off if the cable was ever raised for repair.

The mission was so successful that a nuclear-powered tap that could store a year’s worth of data was created for the Navy by AT&T’s Bell Laboratories, and additional submarines began monitoring Soviet undersea cables around the world. For almost ten years, everything was going swimmingly, then disaster struck.

In January 1980, a 44-year-old employee of the NSA named Ronald Pelton realized he was seriously in debt. Pelton walked into the Soviet embassy in Washington, D.C., and over the next five years, he sold information to the Soviets about signals intelligence, including information on Operation Ivy Bells.

The U.S. was taken by surprise when, in 1981, U.S. surveillance satellites showed a flotilla of Soviet ships, including a salvage vessel, sitting right above the site of the wiretap. The submarine USS Parche was dispatched to recover the tap, but they found that the Soviets had already taken it. As of 1999, the wiretap device was on public display at the Great Patriotic War Museum in Moscow.

In July 1985, the reason that the tap had been discovered was revealed when Pelton’s contact, a KGB colonel named Vitaly Yurchenko, defected to America. Yurchenko told U.S. agents about Pelton’s espionage, which led to Pelton’s arrest and 30-year jail sentence. He was released in 2015.","The article discusses Operation Ivy Bells, which involved wiretapping a Soviet undersea communication cable.

Since 2015, there have been reports of Russian submarines and spy ships trawling the waters near the ocean-spanning underwater fiber-optic cables vital to trans-oceanic Internet access. In fact, reported activity by spy ship Yartar off the U.S. nuclear-armed submarine base in King’s Bay, Georgia is likely in search of secret military cables used exclusively by the Pentagon.

The Russians might be interested in hacking into those cables because the U.S. Navy pulled off such an exploit forty-six years earlier using a specially-modified spy submarine, a nuclear-powered wiretap, and some helium-swilling aquanauts.

**The _Halibut_, Missile-Sub Turned Spy Submarine**

Commissioned in 1960, the USS _Halibut_ was a one-of-a-kind nuclear-powered submarine designed to launch Regulus II nuclear-tipped cruise missiles. The 5,000-ton submarine housed two 17.5-meter-long Regulus II missiles in a grotesquely bulged hangar on her foredeck. The missiles were launched while surfaced from a hydraulically extended ramp to strike targets up to 1,150 miles away.

However, by the time the _Halibut_ entered service, the Navy had developed the Polaris, the U.S.’s first Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile, which could be fired from underwater into space to strike targets nearly 3,000 miles away. The obsolete Regulus II was canceled a year before the _Halibut_ was commissioned in 1960, and the submarine spent four years lugging five older Regulus I missiles on deterrence patrols before these too were retired.

Still, the Navy saw useful potential in the _Halibut’s_ unconventional layout, and in 1968 she received a unique overhaul. The bulged missile hangar was converted into the ‘Bat Cave’ stuffed full of spy equipment, including a rare 60s-era 24bit UNIVAC computer, a retractable seafloor-scanning sonar, and a photo-developing lab. A well underneath the Bat Cave could deploy two 2-ton ‘Fish’—remotely operated underwater spy vehicles.

The _Halibut’s_ first mission was to locate the Soviet ballistic missile submarine K-129, which sank nearly 5,000 meters to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean under mysterious circumstances. The Soviet Navy searched for K-129 for months, but it was the _Halibut_ that finally found her with her “Fish” that August.

In 1972, Captain James Bradley of the Office of Naval Intelligence thought of a new use for the _Halibut_. The Soviet Navy maintained a major nuclear-missile armed submarine base at Petropavlovsk on the remote Kamchatka Peninsula. Bradley felt it was likely that the base maintained an undersea communication cable to transmit messages directly across the Sea of Okhotsk.

After a week of snooping, the _Halibut’s_ crew finally spotted beach signs in Cyrillic warning ships not to lay anchor. Discretely, the technicians in the Bat Cave began scanning the seafloor with her ‘Fish’, and in a matter of hours spotted the cable 120-meters below the sea via a grainy video feed. The elite saturation divers swam out to the cable and wrapped a three-foot long magnetic induction device around the cable.

The operation was considered so secret that most of the _Halibut’s_ crew were told their mission was to recover fragments from a P-500 “Sandbox” missile test for analysis. The brief tape was brought back to Pearl Harbor and found to be highly promising.

Thenceforth, the _Halibut_ and other submarines began regular courier runs to install new tapes on the tap while bringing back the old tapes for analysis by the NSA in what was called Operation Ivy Bells. The tapped cables provided a treasure trove of intelligence for the NSA, influencing U.S. military leaders and negotiating postures.

However, when the _Parche_ went to pick up the latest tape, the tap was missing. In July 1985, Soviet KGB defector Vitaly Yurchenko revealed that Ronald Pelton, a heavily indebted former analyst for the NSA, had sold the secret of Ivy Bells to the Soviets for $5,000.","The article discusses the USS Halibut's operation to tap into undersea communication cables used by the Soviet Navy.

Sanctions imposed on Russia in June 2018 have targeted a Russian mini-submarine builder associated with cable-tampering operations.

In 2018 reports have multiplied in the United States and Europe that Russian has intensified its submarine activity around the undersea cables which are essential for the global operation of the internet.

Yes, you heard that right—the ability of an American user to access a website in Europe or vice versa largely depends upon a network of several hundred distinct armored, fiber-optic Submarine Communication Cables that run across around six hundred thousand miles of ocean floor—and Moscow is dispatching mini submarines apparently to tamper with them.

Washington is reportedly plenty worried about this fact, but can’t exactly get on its high horse about this activity, as U.S. submarines actually pioneered the art of tapping into submarine cables decades earlier. In fact, the USS Jimmy Carter, one of only three super-advanced Sea Wolf class submarines built, has been specially modified to perform such missions.

The first undersea cables established telegraph communications between the UK and France in 1850, followed by a trans-Atlantic cable in 1858. The history of cable-tampering dates all the way back to the Spanish American war 120 years ago when the United States cut cables connecting Madrid with Spanish outposts in the Philippines, Puerto Rico and Cuba—the operation in Guantanamo Bay undertaken while battling nearby Spanish ground and naval forces!

Trans-oceanic cables were also cut by belligerents on all sides during World War I (when submarines first entered the global cable sabotage role) and II. Even in peacetime, undersea cables lack much in the way of formal protection under international law as they do not formally belong to any one nation.

It’s not exactly clear what the Russian submarines, under the direction of the Russian Navy’s Directorate of Deep Sea Research (GUGI) are doing with the cables—or what they’re capable of doing. Tapping into the cables requires exotic techniques to access the delicate fibers inside the cable without exposing them to seawater. The Jimmy Carter reportedly uses a special floodable chamber to perform this operation. No Russian ships are confirmed to have such a capability, but Russian media sources have claimed a capability to hack into the cables.

Sabotage would be simpler to perform, but difficult to scale up for meaningful effect. This is because networks are designed with a high degree of redundancy as cables are routinely damaged by falling anchors, sharks (yes, really!), fishing lines, earthquakes, human mischief makers and so forth. Cable breaks average fifty per year in the Atlantic alone. If a few of the cables go down, data requests are simply shunted to other cables while a fleet of specially appointed, repair boats cruise over and repair the breakages.

It would therefore take a coordinated, massed attack to truly cripple the trans-Atlantic cables—a feat that experts claim is logistically impractical. Even in that event, satellite communications (though more vulnerable to interception) could be used for vital tasks, though a genuine massive cable shutdown would indeed cripple trans-Atlantic web access, with major spillover effects on the economy and financial sector.

If you glance at the global cable network at this site, though, you can see just how extensive the redundancies are between Europe and the United States—but may also note that some countries are not so well connected.

Such geographically isolated countries, and specific military or even industrial sites (think oil platforms) may be more vulnerable to sabotage. For example, Vietnam had internet access crippled for months in 2007 when fishermen pulled up one of the country’s two undersea cables with their fishing line. A targeted cable attack could be used for operational effect in a specific region as well.

In fact, it’s possible that Russia’s true target are the Pentagon’s secret DoDIN cable network distinct from the publicly accessible civilian system. These would have less redundancy than civilian cables and could disable key communication capabilities during a crisis. Already, an accidental cable outage in 2008 crippled U.S. drone operations over Iraq for several days.

NATO also maintains an undersea network called the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) for monitoring the movements of submarines—the sabotaging of which would facilitate Russian submarine operations. (China incidentally has begun building its own ‘Underwater Great Wall’, starting with listening posts near Micronesia and the southern tip of the Marianna Trench.) After decades of neglect, the Pentagon has begun upgrading the system.

At any rate, Russia has deployed increasing number of special-operations oriented mini-submarines to facilitate it clandestine cable activities. Some operate from a secret base in the Arctic Kola Peninsula, and others are based upon an ‘oceanographic research vessel’ called the Yantar. (Again, this kind of obvious fiction was also used by the U.S. Navy during the Cold War with ships like the USS Pueblo.)

The Yantar carries two three person mini-submarines Rus and Consul, which can dive down to six thousand meters—allowing them to reach very deep cables—and may store additional submarines or unmanned submersibles in its huge hangar. Submarine expert HI Sutton at Covert Shores has helpfully mapped out how the Yantar’s activities clearly follow undersea cables near Cuba, Turkey, and the U.S. nuclear ballistic missile submarine base at King’s Baby, Georgia (likely scouting for secret U.S. military cables). A second Yantar-class vessel is scheduled to enter service in 2020.

Another one of Russia’s one-of-a-kind Special Operations subs is the sixty or seventy-four-meter long Losharik (named after a cartoon horse) which is powered by a nuclear reactor and can reportedly dive as deep as twenty-five hundred meters under the sea. Most military submarines can only safely dive between two hundred to five hundred meters. Appearing more conventional from the outside, Losharik’s interior is built out of seven six-meter diameter spherical compartments to better withstand pressure. The short-range Losharik is hauled into position by the much larger Podmovskovye mothership submarine converted from the Delta-class nuclear-powered attack submarine K-64. The converted Delta-class Orenburg is also capable of deploying mini-submarines, and an additional Oscar-class submarine is being converted to this purpose.

The U.S. has begun responding to the threat, with 2018 defense budget authorizing construction of a second cable-laying/repair ship costing $250 million to supplement the only one currently in U.S. military service, the USS Zeus. Sanctions imposed on Russia in June 2018 have targeted a Russian mini-submarine builder associated with cable-tampering operations. A newly formed joint-U.S./Europe Atlantic Command will also strengthen NATO’s ability to monitor submarine activities. A logical additional step would be to strengthen international law around cables to make the act of cutting them more transgressive in a non-wartime context.

Generally speaking, fear of a massive cable attack is probably over-hyped at least for a country with as may redundant cables as the United States pitted against a limited number of Russian special operations submarines. Furthermore, spying and attacks on cables have abundant historical precedents.

Nonetheless, the extensive Russian military activity around the submarine cables surely reveals that they are perceived as a valuable avenue for asymmetric attack and intelligence gathering, and a capacity to launch a more targeted attack against selected cables could cause significant disruptions.

Kissinger chair and Senior Vice-President Kathleen H. Hicks.

Among the many topics and conclusions in the paper was that Russia was engaged in a massive effort in the Baltic and Norwegian Seas to intimidate the smaller powers in the area. One of their main efforts there and world-wide is the deep ocean interception of intelligence through the tapping of trans-ocean undersea communications cables.

On June 12th, the day of the Trump-Kim Jong Un meeting, CNN reported on the Russian effort to intercept undersea communication as a reason for new economic sanctions by the USA against certain Russian individuals and institutions. It seems the Russians are finding new ways to gather information.

Only it’s not so new. The United States was engaged in the same type of intelligence gathering in the 1970’s, using cutting edge technologies – some of which are still classified. The information gleaned by these US efforts was instrumental in American understanding of not only Russian military preparedness and plans, but of Soviet command and control and the state of both the Soviet military and the Soviet political hierarchy.

“Operation Ivy Bells” was the brain-child of US Navy Captain James Bradley, a WWII submarine veteran and chief of Naval Undersea Intelligence in the late 1960’s/early 1970’s. By 1971, Bradley had successfully pitched his ideas to the then unknown and ultra-secret National Security Agency (NSA). The submarine chosen for the project, SSGN-587 USS Halibut, would secretly enter Soviet waters in the Sea of Okhotsk in the Russian Far East.

The Sea of Okhotsk was chosen for a number of reasons. First, it was the naval link between the Soviet Pacific Fleet’s base at Petropavlovsk on the Kamchatka Peninsula, and the Fleet’s headquarters on the Russian mainland at Vladivostok.

Much of the Sea of Okhotsk was off limits to civilian fishing or other vessels, and was heavily patrolled and monitored by sound detecting underwater devices. For all of those reasons (which, summed up, meant that the area was ultra-important to the Soviets and likely to contain deeply held secrets), the area of the Sea of Okhotsk was chosen by Bradley, the Navy and the NSA.

The Halibut (and later other subs) were disguised as deep-water rescue and research vessels for any prying eyes. Their hulls and propulsion systems were made ultra quiet. On their hulls were mounted fake “deep-submergence rescue vehicles” or “DSRV’s” that would normally have indicated a rescue/research vehicle. These were actually diving ports, or lock-outs from which navy divers would exit.

The divers themselves were among the first in the world to utilize some of the new breathing science that deep water divers use today. At 400 feet (the depth at which the Soviet cable was found), divers using a typical SCUBA oxygen supply would only be able to stay under water for minutes. With the use of a mixture which contained more helium than nitrogen (the air in SCUBA tanks is 80% nitrogen/20%oxygen), divers could stay underwater much longer, without risk of nitrogen narcosis, better known as “the bends”, which can result in death.

The Americans found the Russian military cable 120 miles off the Soviet coast in an area clearly marked as forbidden to civilian vessels – this gave them a good hint as to where to look. They then attached a device twenty feet long to the cable, which wrapped around its entire diameter. All communication that went through this cable (and it was considerable) was recorded on the device to be picked up by another US submarine. So confident were the Soviets in the security of their cable that much of the communications was in the clear (not coded). US intelligence even got to listen to phone conversations between Russian officers, their wives, mistresses and each other about issues that had nothing to do with naval strategy.

Much of this technology is still highly classified today. The cable was not pierced, which might let in water and clue in the Russians, and the device was pressure triggered to detach itself should the cable be removed from the ocean floor.

So secret was this project that most of the sailors on board did not know what the true objective of the submarine was. They were told that they were on a top secret mission to retrieve pieces of a subsonic Soviet underwater missile which had blown up. This was actually true. While the divers were deploying their device, the rest of the crew searched for the remains of this missile – which they found. The mission was in actuality…double-secret!

This program continued for almost ten years. The amount of intelligence gleaned from it can only be guessed, though some of the less important information was released at the end of the Cold War in the 1990’s. In 1981, the submarine USS Parche went to retrieve a device from the cable, and found that it was not there – the Soviets were onto the program! It’s a testimony to the skill of the crew of the Parche that they remained undetected, even though the Soviets had to know they were coming.

After a long analysis, it was determined that NSA agent Richard Pelton, who was in massive debt, had been selling the Soviets classified information for some time. Part of this information was “Operation Ivy Bells”. Pelton served twenty-nine years in federal prison, being released in 2015.

**Author: Yujia He**

Digital connectivity is the cornerstone for growth in the 21st Century. A 2009 World Bank report found that for every 10 percent increase in high-speed internet connections, there is a 1.3 percent increase in economic growth. Ninety-nine percent of international telecommunications transit through submarine cables. The lack of resilient digital infrastructure creates a bottleneck to economic development for emerging markets. China is eager to expand its own international communications network and tap into other markets to meet their growing infrastructure needs. This brief analyzes the rising demand for cable infrastructure and obstacles to infrastructure growth, and China’s growing role in the cable industry. It also recommends how emerging economies can enhance international connectivity and address related vulnerabilities.

**Rising demand for international communications infrastructure**

Since the first cable across the English Channel in 1850, submarine cables have served as backbones for international communications. The mass adoption of smartphones and cloud computing, and the growing ubiquity of broadband create surging international data demand. Major growth occurred in intra-Asia, EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), and Latin America routes.

**Obstacles for new infrastructure development**

Financing remains the primary obstacle to cable growth, as submarine cables are capital intensive projects with highly uncertain future returns. Political risks can also affect investment screening and permissions for cable landing and routing.

**Growing role of Chinese investments**

China has significant interests in cable infrastructure to meet its connectivity demand and increase connectivity in other emerging markets. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) also pledges to support cable development.

**Protecting Cable Infrastructure and Managing Cyber Risks**

Robust domestic regulations are crucial for cable protection. Fishing and ship anchoring is responsible for about 70% of cable faults. Cybersecurity is another enduring concern in cable infrastructure. 

This brief emphasizes the need for emerging economies to develop robust domestic regulations and international coordination to reduce political risks, protect cable infrastructure, and manage cyber risks.","The article discusses submarine cables extensively, emphasizing their critical role in international telecommunications and economic development.

Should We Be Worried?**  
In 2018 reports have multiplied in the United States and Europe that Russian has intensified its submarine activity around the undersea cables which are essential for the global operation of the internet.

Yes, you heard that right—the ability of an American user to access a website in Europe or vice versa largely depends upon a network of several hundred distinct armored, fiber-optic Submarine Communication Cables that run across around six hundred thousand miles of ocean floor—and Moscow is dispatching mini submarines apparently to tamper with them.

Washington is reportedly plenty worried about this fact, but can’t exactly get on its high horse about this activity, as U.S. submarines actually pioneered the art of tapping into submarine cables decades earlier. In fact, the USS Jimmy Carter, one of only three super-advanced Sea Wolf class submarines built, has been specially modified to perform such missions.

The first undersea cables established telegraph communications between the UK and France in 1850, followed by a trans-Atlantic cable in 1858. The history of cable-tampering dates all the way back to the Spanish American war 120 years ago when the United States cut cables connecting Madrid with Spanish outposts in the Philippines, Puerto Rico and Cuba—the operation in Guantanamo Bay undertaken while battling nearby Spanish ground and naval forces!

Trans-oceanic cables were also cut by belligerents on all sides during World War I and II. Even in peacetime, undersea cables lack much in the way of formal protection under international law as they do not formally belong to any one nation.

It’s not exactly clear what the Russian submarines, under the direction of the Russian Navy’s Directorate of Deep Sea Research (GUGI) are doing with the cables—or what they’re capable of doing. Tapping into the cables requires exotic techniques to access the delicate fibers inside the cable without exposing them to seawater. The Jimmy Carter reportedly uses a special floodable chamber to perform this operation. No Russian ships are confirmed to have such a capability, but Russian media sources have claimed a capability to hack into the cables.

Sabotage would be simpler to perform, but difficult to scale up for meaningful effect. This is because networks are designed with a high degree of redundancy as cables are routinely damaged by falling anchors, sharks (yes, really!), fishing lines, earthquakes, human mischief makers and so forth. Cable breaks average fifty per year in the Atlantic alone. If a few of the cables go down, data requests are simply shunted to other cables while a fleet of specially appointed, repair boats cruise over and repair the breakages.

It would therefore take a coordinated, massed attack to truly cripple the trans-Atlantic cables—a feat that experts claim is logistically impractical. Even in that event, satellite communications could be used for vital tasks, though a genuine massive cable shutdown would indeed cripple trans-Atlantic web access, with major spillover effects on the economy and financial sector.

If you glance at the global cable network at this site, though, you can see just how extensive the redundancies are between Europe and the United States—but may also note that some countries are not so well connected.

Such geographically isolated countries, and specific military or even industrial sites may be more vulnerable to sabotage. For example, Vietnam had internet access crippled for months in 2007 when fishermen pulled up one of the country’s two undersea cables with their fishing line. A targeted cable attack could be used for operational effect in a specific region as well.

In fact, it’s possible that Russia’s true target are the Pentagon’s secret DoDIN cable network distinct from the publicly accessible civilian system. These would have less redundancy than civilian cables and could disable key communication capabilities during a crisis. Already, an accidental cable outage in 2008 crippled U.S. drone operations over Iraq for several days.

NATO also maintains an undersea network called the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) for monitoring the movements of submarines—the sabotaging of which would facilitate Russian submarine operations. (China incidentally has begun building its own ‘Underwater Great Wall’, starting with listening posts near Micronesia and the southern tip of the Marianna Trench.) After decades of neglect, the Pentagon has begun upgrading the system.

At any rate, Russia has deployed increasing number of special-operations oriented mini-submarines to facilitate its clandestine cable activities. Some operate from a secret base in the Arctic Kola Peninsula, and others are based upon an ‘oceanographic research vessel’ called the Yantar. The Yantar carries two three person mini-submarines Rus and Consul, which can dive down to six thousand meters—allowing them to reach very deep cables—and may store additional submarines or unmanned submersibles in its huge hangar. Submarine expert HI Sutton at Covert Shores has helpfully mapped out how the Yantar’s activities clearly follow undersea cables near Cuba, Turkey, and the U.S. nuclear ballistic missile submarine base at King’s Baby, Georgia (likely scouting for secret U.S. military cables). A second Yantar-class vessel is scheduled to enter service in 2020.

Another one of Russia’s one-of-a-kind Special Operations subs is the sixty or seventy-four-meter long Losharik (named after a cartoon horse) which is powered by a nuclear reactor and can reportedly dive as deep as twenty-five hundred meters under the sea. Most military submarines can only safely dive between two hundred to five hundred meters. Appearing more conventional from the outside, Losharik’s interior is built out of seven six-meter diameter spherical compartments to better withstand pressure. The short-range Losharik is hauled into position by the much larger Podmovskovye mothership submarine converted from the Delta-class nuclear-powered attack submarine K-64. The converted Delta-class Orenburg is also capable of deploying mini-submarines, and an additional Oscar-class submarine is being converted to this purpose.

The U.S. has begun responding to the threat, with 2018 defense budget authorizing construction of a second cable-laying/repair ship costing $250 million to supplement the only one currently in U.S. military service, the USS Zeus. Sanctions imposed on Russia in June 2018 have targeted a Russian mini-submarine builder associated with cable-tampering operations. A newly formed joint-U.S./Europe Atlantic Command will also strengthen NATO’s ability to monitor submarine activities. A logical additional step would be to strengthen international law around cables to make the act of cutting them more transgressive in a non-wartime context.

Generally speaking, fear of a massive cable attack is probably over-hyped at least for a country with as many redundant cables as the United States pitted against a limited number of Russian special operations submarines. Furthermore, spying and attacks on cables have abundant historical precedents.

Nonetheless, the extensive Russian military activity around the submarine cables surely reveals that they are perceived as a valuable avenue for asymmetric attack and intelligence gathering, and a capacity to launch a more targeted attack against selected cables could cause significant disruptions.

**By Frank Rose**  

We increasingly rely on space, cyberspace, and fiber-optic communications cables in all aspects of our lives. These systems are critical for social and economic activity, but most importantly to defend our security. At the same time, these conduits for communication are vulnerable to state and nonstate actors. The continued and assured access to these capabilities is vital to global strategic stability.

In 2015, approximately 97 percent of the world’s transoceanic communications transited over privately held, commercial, undersea fiber-optic communications cables. A large-scale outage of these undersea cables would affect critical governmental and business operations, communications, financial transactions, logistics, and transportation. We are concerned that potential adversaries may be looking for vulnerabilities in undersea cables around the world.

Cyberthreats to U.S. national and economic security are increasing in frequency, scale, sophistication, and severity of impact. The ranges of cyberthreat actors, methods of attack, targeted systems, and victims are also expanding. Adding to the problem, it is not always easy to identify the origin of such attacks.

Further, our reliance on international space systems has risen to an unprecedented global scale. We already face a global threat from electronic warfare systems capable of jamming satellite communications systems and global navigation space systems. In addition, threats to space systems from debris or irresponsible activities are increasing. In particular, we are concerned by Chinese and Russian pursuit of weapons systems to destroy satellites in orbit. The debris created from such activities lingers uncontrollably, thus creating the potential for impacts far beyond the destruction of an individual targeted satellite.

We should not look at space, cyber, and undersea cables independently of one another. If a determined adversary wants to cut off U.S. and allied access to communications infrastructure, it is likely to deploy capabilities to attack space, cyberspace, and undersea cables at the same time, in a coordinated manner, and across a broad spectrum of means.

There are also cross-domain vulnerabilities. What happens in outer space won’t stay in outer space. Satellites are vulnerable to cyberintrusions, as we saw take place in 2014 when a cyberattack compromised four U.S. weather satellites. Banking, mapping, and other essential parts of the global internet infrastructure are dependent on space assets for services such as timing and location data. Additionally, space and cyberassets are vital to our deterrent and defensive capabilities, including communications, positioning, and nuclear command and control. It is easy to see how attacks in these domains could lead to a wider kinetic conflict.

It is interesting to see where there are linkages in the policy and diplomatic approach to addressing these threats, especially in space and cyber domains. A common thread is the lack of widely accepted and enforceable norms of responsible behavior. There are existing treaties on space policy and undersea cables, whereas none currently exist relating to cyberspace. In space and cyberspace, we face similar challenges to pursuing traditional arms control, given the dual-use nature of these systems, the number of actors, and the challenges of attribution and verification. To address these challenges, we have worked to pursue consensus among states that international law applies in both domains and further clarify how foundational laws, such as the law of armed conflict and the UN Charter, apply.

So what does any of this have to do with nuclear arms control and disarmament? Continued progress in reducing nuclear arsenals cannot be divorced from the global security environment or our unconditional commitment to the security of our allies. Ensuring security depends in part on our success in constructing mutually agreed-on norms that referee behavior in these largely unregulated domains. Establishing clear rules of the road in these realms can help create the security conditions for future nuclear arms reductions.

Going forward, we must enhance and communicate our cross-domain deterrence in a credible manner to achieve and maintain stability. This effort will require better monitoring and verification capabilities to make attribution easier. We also need to be working more closely with our allies. Our worldwide system of alliances is a true “asymmetric advantage” of the United States. Meanwhile, we must look within our own government to ensure we are taking a whole-of-government approach and to avoid the instinct of stove-piping that can paralyze the bureaucracy. I see this area as a priority for the U.S. government now and in the future.

**Abstract**  
Undersea cables are among the most critical technologies supporting today's global data and voice communications. Long-standing physical vulnerabilities to attack persist: cable landing stations cluster high-value cable systems at single geographic points, without the physical protections provided to other critical infrastructure. With increasing use of remotely-controlled network management systems, operators have introduced additional risks of large-scale cyber attacks. Collaboration on fortifying security with new regulatory and voluntary actions is urgently needed.

**INTRODUCTION**  
Cyber experts predict a new era of malware attacks on critical infrastructure systems. Reports indicate significant vulnerabilities in SCADA systems controlling essential services. This paper explores the vulnerabilities to cyber attacks of infrastructure that carries nearly all the world's data and voice traffic: undersea communications cables. An attack on the cables' control systems could devastate the world's economies, presenting a different kind of Internet ""kill switch"".

**CRITICALITY OF UNDERSEA CABLES**  
Undersea cables transmit nearly 99% of all trans-oceanic Internet and data traffic. The failure of cable systems could lead to catastrophic consequences, as alternatives like satellites cannot compensate for their capacity. The technology needs to be among the most reliable in the world, operational with up to ""5 nines"" reliability.

**CABLE LANDING SITES: EXPOSURES AND RISKS**  
Cable landing sites are critical infrastructures. Gaining access to these sites could allow a hacker to disrupt significant portions of states' cyber infrastructure. It is crucial that industry and government treat cable system physical security with utmost seriousness and concern.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, highlighting their critical role in global communications and the vulnerabilities associated with them.

Olenya Bay on the coast of the Barents Sea is home to a fleet of nuclear powered spy submarines and surface vessels which NATO now says are dramatically stepping up activities around undersea data cables in the North Atlantic.

Ever heard about Russia’s Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research? Well, better now than later. The Directorate, nicknamed GUGI, is a branch directly under General Staff of the Armed Forces. From its base 100 kilometers east of the border to Norway, a fleet of nine nuclear-powered submarines and a few surface vessels frequently sails out on special missions. Little is known about the nature of those voyages, except reports of significantly increased activity along subsea cables which carry global electronic communication.

In this article, the Barents Observer takes a closer look at the base in Olenya Bay and activities carried on. Through satellite images and other non-classified sources.

Russia is currently expanding its fleet of special purpose vessels aimed at seabed operations. Surprisingly little information is published about the vessels and their homeport north of Murmansk. A recent report, though, written by Member of the British Parliament Rishi Sunak, quotes several NATO officials openly claiming the vessels are ""aggressively operating"" near cables vital for global data communication.

> ""We are now seeing Russian underwater activity in the vicinity of underwater cables that I don’t believe we have ever seen.""

Before Christmas, the Washington Post quoted U.S. Navy Admiral Andrew Lennon, commander of NATO’s submarine force: ""We are now seeing Russian underwater activity in the vicinity of underwater cables that I don’t believe we have ever seen."" The Admiral pointed to transatlantic connections, linking internet between Europe and North-America. ""Russia is clearly taking an interest in NATO and NATO nations’ undersea infrastructure.""

Lennon declined to say whether NATO believes Russian auxiliary submarines have actually touched the cables. Russia’s Embassy in Oslo has not responded to questions from the Barents Observer about the accusations.

One of the intelligence vessels in question is ""Yantar"" - which can be seen moored at the pier in the upper right corner of the satellite image in top of this article. She carries two small submarines thought to be capable of cutting cables or tapping them for information, the British report says. Officially, the ship is used for deep-sea research and rescue operations.

Since 2015, the vessel has been sailing from the Kola Peninsula on voyages outside the coast of Norway, across the Atlantic, sailing the east coast of North-America from Canada in the north to Cuba in the south. Currently, ""Yantar"" is outside the coast of South America assisting in the search for the Argentinian navy’s submarine that went missing in November. A sister vessel, ""Almaz"", also to act as a mothership to mini-submarines, is currently under construction at a yard in Kaliningrad.

Comprising more than 800,000 kilometers of fibre-optics, the world’s 213 independent subsea cables are the arteries to modern society as we know it. Rishi Sunak explains the reason to be worried in his report: ""In a single day, these cables carry some $10 trillion of financial transfers and process some 15 million financial transactions."" 97% of global communication are transmitted via cables lying deep beneath the oceans. There are no way satellites can compensate in case cables are cut.

> ""Undersea cables are the indispensable infrastructure of our time, essential to our modern life and digital economy, yet they are inadequately protected and highly vulnerable to attack at sea and on land, from both hostile states and terrorists.""

A critical scenario is cables cut or disrupted with immediately catastrophic effects both to economy and society. Sunak points to Crimea, where internet and telecommunication was unexpectedly cut off from the rest of Ukraine in March 2014.

Parliament Member Rishi Sunak especially mentions Scandinavia when elaborating on Russia’s aggressive operations near undersea cables. Several links are from the Baltic to Sweden and Finland, while Denmark is linked with Sweden, the U.K., Iceland, Germany and Norway. Norway have two Arctic cables to Svalbard, plus several interregional tele- and optical fiber links along the coast, like in Finnmark, the region bordering Russia in the north.

Asked by the Barents Observer about possible Russian activities near tele- or data communication cables, Norway’s Minister of Defense, Frank Bakke-Jensen says both Norway and allies keep a close eye on what happens.

In general terms the Minister says: ""Russia’s military capability has been significantly strengthened in recent years, also in our neighborhood. They develop new capacities and have more training and exercises. However, the High North still remain a region largely characterized by stability and cooperation. Increased military activity shows that we and our allies should closely follow Russian activity and the development in our neighboring areas,"" Bakke-Jensen says. He will not elaborate further.

Meanwhile, the officers living in Olenya Bay prepare for new submarines to be attached to the secret missions carried out.

Consisting of nine nuclear powered submarines today, the 29th Special Submarine Squadron have means and technology to dive deeper than any of the other weapon carrying war-submarines sailing for the Northern Fleet. The satellite image in the top shows how entrance to the base town, storehouses and piers is strictly regulated. All surrounded by barbed wire fences. Two road checkpoints will effectively hinder unwanted persons access to the harbour area where the submarines are moored. The first one is on the main road from Murmansk, before the exit to Polyarny, while the second one is seen at the base in Olenya Bay. To load and unload equipment used on seafloor missions, and to avoid being spotted from satellites, two floating docks serve the submarines at the base.

A Russian mapping service based on satellite images, Wikimapia, details the town in Olenya Bay with barracks, 5-floors apartment houses, a naval hospital, school, food shop, canteen and café and the boiler house for the central heating. In the port, the different vessels, a floating power station, the two docks, garages, technical workshops and piers are marked.

Russia’s Yandex map satellite service even reveals two of the actual special purpose submarines at pier. One of them is the 74 meters long Losharik, the other is likely an older 53 meters long Paltus class (X-ray by NATO). Both are nuclear powered. More rare photos of the Uniform-class mini-submarines, and how they are believed to operate on the seafloor, are posted at the blog-site Military Russia. The photos are both from the base in Olenya Bay and from the naval yard in Severodvinsk outside Arkhangelsk.

With the ships in Olenya Bay, Russia has the world’s largest deep-sea fleet. Among the capabilities are two titanium hull Kashalot (Uniform-class) submarines named AS-13 and AS-15. A third vessel of the class, AS-33, is reportedly written off. There are three of the Paltus (X-ray class by NATO), the AS-23, AS-21 and AS-35. Then, it’s the Losharik, AS-12, the latest spy-submarine added to the fleet in the late 90s.

> At the yard in Severodvinsk, yet another nuclear powered mini-submarine is currently under construction.

Additionally, two larger former ballistic missile submarines are rebuilt for the 29th Special Submarine Squadron. ""Orenburg"" (BS-136) is a former Delta-III class, while the ""Podmoskovye"" (BS-64) is a rebuilt Delta-IV class submarine. In late 2016, the Barents Observer posted a video of the ""Podmoskovye"" sailing out to the White Sea from the yard in Severodvinsk after 16 years of refit. Among other things, the missile compartment was cut out and space for scientific-experimental equipment were placed instead. Most visible from outside is the flat deck behind the tower where mini-submarines can be attached. It is also believed that ""Podmoskovye"" can carry the Losharik mini-submarine below the hull.

The submarine can also bring - or remove - other small installations and devices for military purposes to be placed on the sea floor. In the Arctic, or at other locations important for the Russian navy. Such devices can be noice-makers to distract foreign submarines when Russian submarines sail out from the Kola Peninsula to the North Atlantic. Other listening devices can detect sounds made by the propellers of enemy ships. The submarine can launch and recover unmanned subsea vehicles.

Lifting sensitive equipment from crashed aircrafts, other vessels or even satellites from the seabed are other tasks to be carried out by the submarine.

The head of Britain's military says Russia could try to sever undersea communications cables, and protecting them is a defense priority for NATO.  

Air Chief Marshal Stuart Peach says cutting or disrupting the cables could have a ""potentially catastrophic"" economic effect.  

Peach told an audience at the Royal United Services Institute that ""along with our Atlantic allies, we have prioritised missions and tasks to protect the sea lines of communication.""  

In yesterday's speech, Peach said that Russia ""in addition to new ships and submarines continues to perfect both unconventional capabilities and information warfare."" He said NATO is working ""to match and understand Russian fleet modernization.""  

Earlier this month the Policy Exchange think-tank highlighted how Russia had ""easily"" severed all digital communications to Crimea during its 2014 invasion of the Black Sea peninsula.","The article discusses the potential for Russia to sever undersea communication cables, emphasizing the economic implications and the importance of protecting these cables as a defense priority for NATO.

When a July 2015 undersea tremor triggered a rockslide between the islands of Saipan and Tinian in the Northern Marianas Islands, it cut the only fiber-optic cable connecting the archipelago to the global network. Air traffic control grounded flights, automated teller machines shut down, web and phone connections broke.

All the feared impacts of a cyber attack became real for the islanders. A Taiwan-based cable repair ship eventually restored the link, but that was a single break from one natural occurrence. How much more disruption could a deep-sea-faring nation cause its rivals through malicious intent?

Though often mentioned in passing, the fact that the overwhelming bulk of Internet activity travels along submarine cables fails to register with the public. High-flying satellites orbiting the crowded skies, continent-spanning microwave towers and million miles of old 20th Century copper phone wire all carry but a fraction of the Earth's Internet traffic compared with deep-sea fiber-optic cables.

All that buzz occurs in the dark cold parts of inner space and a few very quiet places on land. If you want to tap into that buzz, those quiet places where the sea cables make landfall—from the onshore facilities out to deep-water offshore—are your prized targets. The U.S. has developed exquisite abilities to access underwater things.

_(This first appeared in 2015.)_

One of America's greatest techno-spy capers of the Cold War involved tapping Soviet Navy communications via a submarine cable in the 1970s and 1980s. Before IVY BELLS ended with its unmasking by Soviet spy Ronald Pelton, its clandestine aquanauts, spy sub and nuclear-powered ""bug"" made espionage history.

If, however, you wish to practice hybrid warfare—disruption and degradation with little overt engagement—then the ability to cut submarine cables at will and at depth gives you a very powerful weapon. Cut up undersea hydrophone networks and you deafen your adversary. Cut Internet cables and you have the ultimate denial-of-service cyber weapon.

In the 1960s, America's advancing deep-sea capabilities alarmed the Soviets for good reason. If the Americans could locate sunken subs and retrieve satellites from the supposedly inviolable deeps, their underwater black ops directly threatened Soviet security.

Amidst a wave of 1960s deep-sea activity—including its saturation-diving SEALAB program, its search & recovery missions for _USS Thresher_, _USS Scorpion_, a lost H-bomb and a new submarine-rescue approach—Admiral Hyman Rickover got his dream sub built. Launched in 1968, the _NR-1_ was a marvel of American ingenuity—a nuclear-powered four-man minisub able to dive over 3,000ft and stay there for weeks.

During the later Cold War, the USSR developed its own very sophisticated underwater black ops capabilities. Targets included the US Navy's SOSUS underwater hydrophone system which ran along the Atlantic from Greenland to the United Kingdom at depths of up to 12,000ft. With its primacy in titanium metallurgy and skill in nuclear technology, the Soviet Union built several competitors to the _NR-1_.

The Russian Federation inherited these assets along with the Ministry of Defense branch (GUGI, or Main Directorate Deep Sea Research) that supervised those programs. The Russian deep-sea clandestine systems survived the collapse of the USSR and received funding even during the lean years during the 1990s. Even as the United States lost the _NR-1's_ capabilities to retirement, Russia bolstered its deep-sea black activities.

Between August and October 2012, a Russian Arctic expedition mapped the seafloor of the Arctic Ocean to locate resources and establish maritime boundaries. A deep-sea ""research"" submarine placed a small Russian flag on the ocean floor some 13,200ft below the North Pole to mark Russia's claims.

The ""research sub"" was in fact one of Russia's secret deep-sea assets, the nuclear-powered minisub _Losharik_. A naval blogger pointed out that clues to _Losharik's_ internal configuration lay in the vessel's name. ""Losharik"" is a cartoon horse made of linked spheres—some analysts suspect that the sub's interior consists of linked spherical titanium pressure hulls.

_Losharik_ rides to its dive sites in the belly of a larger converted nuclear missile sub, the _Orenburg_. Both have been busy—_Orenburg_ recently surprised Norwegian scientists by popping up from beneath the sea ice after doing who-knows-what.

""[I]t was inexpedient to use GUGI equipment for scientific exploration and mineral extraction,"" said a Russian source. ""On the other hand, they are the world experts in manned deep-water investigations and the training of their crews is on the same level as that of cosmonauts. If we don’t find a job for them, Russia is likely to lose this highly skilled workforce.""

With _Losharik_, its sister sub _Nelma_ and the two bathyscaphes _Rus_ and _Consul,_ the GUGI commands the largest manned deep-sea fleet in the world. Whether domestically produced or foreign imports, these assets can be quietly moved around within Russia itself. Combined with its growing submarine-rescue fleet and Naval Spetznaz outfits, Russia now fields a very powerful undersea hybrid warfare capability. Let's hope the US Navy is on the case.

While the idea that steel and plastic pipes are integral to our life seems anachronistic in this age of cloud computing, “nothing could be further from the truth”, states the report by British think tank Policy Exchange.

Physical pipes, lying deep beneath the ocean, are the “jugulars of the world economy”, writes Rishi Sunak, Conservative MP and the author of the report. 97% of global communications and $10 trillion in daily financial transactions are transmitted not by satellites in the sky, but by undersea cables.

But despite this dependency, security remains a challenge, the report warns.

Undersea cables are “inadequately protected and highly vulnerable to attack at sea and on land, from both hostile states and terrorists”, the think tank says. Their exact locations are isolated and publicly available, making them “a singularly attractive target for our enemies”.

In particular, the report warns that Russia, Iran and China could all look to pipes on the ocean floor as potential “asymmetric targets”.

US intelligence officials have already flagged Russian submarines “aggressively operating” near Atlantic cables as part of its broader interest in unconventional methods of warfare, the think tank says. When Russia annexed Crimea, one of its first moves was to sever the main cable connection to the outside world.

In his foreword to the report, Admiral James Stavridis, US Navy and former NATO supreme allied commander, says that over the course of his career, he has seen the Atlantic Ocean “transition from being a theatre characterised by near complete NATO supremacy to a space that Russia is actively contesting through a resurgent naval doctrine”.

He adds: “If the relative weakness of the Russian position makes a conventional conflict with NATO unlikely, it also raises the appeal for them of asymmetric targets like fibre optic cables.

“... protecting the freedom of the seas and all the lanes of communication on and under them is paramount.”

The report urges the next strategic defence and security review to specifically address threats to Britain’s security from attacks on its undersea cable infrastructure. There should also be a review of UK landing sites where cables come ashore, in order to improve security. The government should also work with private communications companies to install more backup ‘dark cables’ and improve monitoring at sea.

Citing the example of Australia and New Zealand, the report suggests establishing “Cable Protection Zones” around the highest value communications corridors. It also calls on Britain to lead efforts to develop a new international treaty to protect undersea cables.","The article titled ""Undersea cables ‘vulnerable to attack’ from Russia, Iran and China"" discusses the vulnerabilities of undersea cables, stating they are ""indispensable"" to the global economy and highly susceptible to attacks from various nations.

It highlights that 97% of global communications are transmitted via these cables and emphasizes their critical role in economic transactions.

The article also mentions specific incidents and threats, including the historical context of attacks on these cables, making it clear that the topic of cut sea cables is central to the discussion, rather than a minor mention.

Given this focus and the detailed examination of the implications of attacks on undersea cables, the article satisfies the criterion."

The report, titled _Undersea Cables: Indispensable, insecure_, written by Conservative MP Rishi Sunak, discusses how easily cable-based communications can be disrupted, and the past and potential future threats to their continued function.

Cables carrying data are essential to modern communications but lack both physical and legal protections, according to Sunak. Their locations are freely available to the public in order to prevent accidental damage by shipping, but the laws governing them are lax.

He described the current laws as ""far more suited to the comparatively peripheral role the infrastructure played in the '70s and '80s, than to the indispensable status they now hold in the internet age"".

The age of those laws means that enforcement agencies struggle to deal with suspects and offenders with appropriate severity, said Sunak, who added that the need for reform has been ignored by national governments because the cables are often managed by private companies rather than nation states, and therefore slip under the gaze of legislators.

The risk of severed cables is compounded by the aggregation of cables into ""dangerously concentrated"" choke points. Examples of this are the Luzon Strait between Taiwan and the Philippines, which connects several eastern countries and the US, or a single building in Alexandria, Egypt, which holds the meeting point of five transnational cables.

This kind of infrastructure damage could appeal to terrorists, Sunak writes, indicating a foiled Al-Qaeda attack in 2007, meant to target an internet exchange in London, as proof of this.

As well as terrorists, he points at Russia as the other major threat. He cites the severing of the main cable leading into the Crimean peninsula when Russia annexed the region in 2014. The operation of its submarines along cable routes, and the use of the Yantar-class ""intelligence ship"", which carries two submarines believed to be capable of destroying cables or tapping them for information, is also referenced, and are given as evidence by Sunak that Russia may be considering disrupting infrastructure as part of its military strategy.

Sunak recommended that government departments should focus on cable protection in future reviews, and that undersea cables should be designated as critical national infrastructure. Others involved updating international law and military codes to ensure legal protection, and the construction of new cables in diverse locations to act as backups.

Another recommendation pointed to Australia and New Zealand's Cable Protection Zones, where ships cannot fish or anchor, and can only sail through under supervision by the Coast Guard. Britain should ""encourage the establishment"" of such zones in the Suez and the Mediterranean to protect connections with the Middle East, Sunak wrote.

In his concluding remarks in the report, Sunak said: ""Disrupting cables is not only possible and surprisingly easy, but it can have significantly negative consequences for our security and prosperity. Despite this backdrop, there has historically been minimal state involvement in the sector, despite its strategic importance.""","The article discusses the vulnerabilities and threats to undersea cables, directly mentioning terms like 'undersea cables' and the risks of 'severed cables'.

""There is a new risk to our way of life, which is the vulnerability of the cables that criss-cross the seabeds,"" said Britain's military chief, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach.

Peach's warning came after British think tank Policy Exchange released a report that urged the United Kingdom and NATO to beef up security of undersea cables. ""97% of global communications and $10 trillion in daily financial transactions are transmitted not by satellites in the skies, but by cables lying deep beneath the ocean,"" the think tank said. ""Undersea cables are the indispensable infrastructure of our time, essential to our modern life and digital economy, yet they are inadequately protected and highly vulnerable to attack at sea and on land, from both hostile states and terrorists.

When Russia annexed Crimea, one of its first moves was to sever the main cable connection to the outside world.""

Not that America hasn't tampered with underwater communications links. One of the most successful U.S. intelligence operations ever was using submarines to covertly tap Soviet cables in the 1970s. In 1971, Operation Ivy Bells sent the USS Halibut to the Sea of Okhotsk, where it wrapped a listening device around a Soviet line. Until the operation was betrayed in 1981 by an NSA employee spying for Russia, U.S. intelligence listened in on messages that the Russians didn't even feel a need to encrypt.

But more recently, in 2015, the Pentagon warned that it was more Russian ships operating closer to undersea cables. In 2016, there were fears that the Russian spy ship Yantar was interfering with underwater cables bringing connecting Syria to the Internet.

As with landlines, breaks in underwater cables are not uncommon, especially close to shore. But as the New York Times noted in 2015, ""what worries Pentagon planners most is that the Russians appear to be looking for vulnerabilities at much greater depths, where the cables are hard to monitor and breaks are hard to find and repair.""

If anything, the danger is only likely to increase. The proliferation of unmanned underwater vehicles—sea drones—has opened a new horizon of robots that can stealthily and cheaply destroy or eavesdrop on underwater cables.

Insikt Group research examines the complex and dynamic risk environment of submarine cables, the information superhighways that underpin the global economy and facilitate worldwide telecommunications. The rapid expansion of the submarine cable network in the 21st century, driven by data demands, cloud computing, and the needs of hyperscalers like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, must contend with converging geopolitical, physical, and cyber threats. State actors pose the greatest threat in terms of sabotage and spying, followed by non-state actors like hacktivists and ransomware groups, who pose a less capable and lower likelihood threat to the networks and operating systems that submarine cables rely upon. Accidental damage from ships and fishing vessels is more frequent but less impactful.

Major geopolitical developments, specifically Russia's conflict with Ukraine, China's preparations for potential forceful unification with Taiwan, and the deterioration of US-China relations, are likely to fuel physical attacks and intelligence collection efforts against submarine cables. Notably, Russia has shown intent to map the submarine cable system in the Atlantic Ocean and North Sea, very likely for potential sabotage. The impact of these attacks will vary widely, ranging from intermittent traffic disruptions to widespread outages that take days or weeks to resolve, depending on the redundancy and resiliency of the affected network.

Other major developments in the production, ownership, and operation of submarine cables have introduced new geopolitical challenges and created potential vulnerabilities. The rise of Chinese state-owned enterprises as cable owners, operators, and producers has elevated concerns over digital surveillance, while the expanding ownership stakes by hyperscalers has brought forward questions about market monopolies and digital sovereignty.","The article discusses submarine cables and their vulnerabilities, specifically mentioning risks of sabotage and accidental damage, which relate directly to the topic of cut sea cables.

March 30, 2018 / 6:58 AM EDT / AP  

**WASHINGTON** -- Russian ships are skulking around underwater communications cables, causing the U.S. and its allies to worry the Kremlin might be taking information warfare to new depths. Is Moscow interested in cutting or tapping the cables? Does it want the West to worry it might? Is there a more innocent explanation?  

Unsurprisingly, Russia isn't saying.  

But whatever Moscow's intentions, U.S. and Western officials are increasingly troubled by their rival's interest in the 400 fiber-optic cables that carry most of world's calls, emails and texts, as well as $10 trillion worth of daily financial transactions.  

""We've seen activity in the Russian navy, and particularly undersea in their submarine activity, that we haven't seen since the '80s,"" Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of the U.S. European Command, told Congress this month.  

Without undersea cables, a bank in Asian countries couldn't send money to Saudi Arabia to pay for oil. U.S. military leaders would struggle to communicate with troops fighting extremists in Afghanistan and the Middle East. A student in Europe wouldn't be able to Skype his parents in the United States.  

All this information is transmitted along tiny glass fibers encased in undersea cables that, in some cases, are little bigger than a garden hose. All told, there are 620,000 miles of fiber-optic cable running under the sea, enough to loop around the earth nearly 25 times.  

Most lines are owned by private telecommunications companies, including giants like Google and Microsoft. Their locations are easily identified on public maps, with swirling lines that look like spaghetti. While cutting one cable might have limited impact, severing several simultaneously or at choke points could cause a major outage.  

The Russians ""are doing their homework and, in the event of a crisis or conflict with them, they might do rotten things to us,"" said Michael Kofman, a Russian military expert at nonprofit research group CNA Corp.  

It's not Moscow's warfighting ships and submarines that are making NATO and U.S. officials uneasy. It's Russia's Main Directorate of Deep Sea Research, whose specialized surface ships, submarines, underwater drones and mini subs conduct reconnaissance, underwater salvage and other work.  

One ship run by the directorate is the Yantar. It's a modest, 354-foot oceanographic vessel that holds a crew of about 60. It most recently was off South America's coast helping Argentina search for a lost submarine.  

Parlamentskaya Gazeta, the Russian parliament's publication, last October said the Yantar has equipment ""designed for deep-sea tracking"" and ""connecting to top-secret communication cables."" The publication said that in September 2015, the Yantar was near Kings Bay, Georgia, home to a U.S. submarine base, ""collecting information about the equipment on American submarines, including underwater sensors and the unified (U.S. military) information network."" Rossiya, a Russian state TV network, has said the Yantar can not only connect to top-secret cables, but could cut them and ""jam underwater sensors with a special system.""  

Russia's Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.  

There is no hard evidence that the ship is engaged in nefarious activity, said Steffan Watkins, an information technology security consultant in Canada tracking the ship. But he wonders what the ship is doing when it's stopped over critical cables or when its Automatic Identification System tracking transponder isn't on.  

Of the Yantar's crew, he said: ""I don't think these are the actual guys who are doing any sabotage. I think they're laying the groundwork for future operations.""  

Members of Congress are wondering, too.  

Rep. Joe Courtney, a Connecticut Democrat on a House subcommittee on sea power, said of the Russians, ""The mere fact that they are clearly tracking the cables and prowling around the cables shows that they are doing something.""  

Democratic Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, an Armed Services Committee member, said Moscow's goal appears to be to ""disrupt the normal channels of communication and create an environment of misinformation and distrust.""  

The Yantar's movements have previously raised eyebrows.  

On Oct. 18, 2016, a Syrian telecom company ordered emergency maintenance to repair a cable in the Mediterranean that provides internet connectivity to several countries, including Syria, Libya and Lebanon. The Yantar arrived in the area the day before the four-day maintenance began. It left two days before the maintenance ended. It's unknown what work it did while there.  

Watkins described another episode on Nov. 5, 2016, when a submarine cable linking Persian Gulf nations experienced outages in Iran. Hours later, the Yantar left Oman and headed to an area about 60 miles west of the Iranian port city of Bushehr, where the cable runs ashore. Connectivity was restored just hours before the Yantar arrived on Nov. 9. The boat stayed stationary over the site for several more days.  

Undersea cables have been targets before.  

At the beginning of World War I, Britain cut a handful of German underwater communications cables and tapped the rerouted traffic for intelligence. In the Cold War, the U.S. Navy sent American divers deep into the Sea of Okhotsk off the Russian coast to install a device to record Soviet communications, hoping to learn more about the USSR's submarine-launched nuclear capability.  

More recently, British and American intelligence agencies have eavesdropped on fiber optic cables, according to documents released by Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor.  

In 2007, Vietnamese authorities confiscated ships carrying miles of fiber optic cable that thieves salvaged from the sea for profit. The heist disrupted service for several months. And in 2013, Egyptian officials arrested three scuba divers off Alexandria for attempting to cut a cable stretching from France to Singapore. Five years on, questions remain about the attack on a cable responsible for about a third of all internet traffic between Egypt and Europe.  

Despite the relatively few publicly known incidents of sabotage, most outages are due to accidents.  

Two hundred or so cable-related outages take place each year. Most occur when ship anchors snap cables or commercial fishing equipment snags the lines. Others break during tsunamis, earthquakes and other natural disasters.  

But even accidental cuts can harm U.S. military operations.  

In 2008 in Iraq, unmanned U.S. surveillance flights nearly screeched to a halt one day at Balad Air Base not because of enemy mortar attacks or dusty winds. An anchor had snagged a cable hundreds of miles away from the base, situated in the ""Sunni Triangle"" northwest of Baghdad.  

The severed cable had linked controllers based in the United States with unmanned aircraft flying intelligence, surveillance and recognizance missions for coalition forces in the skies over Iraq, explained Ret. Air Force Col. Dave Lujan of Hampton, Virginia.  

""Say you're operating a remote-controlled car and all of a sudden you can't control it,"" said Lujan, who was deputy commander of the 332nd Expeditionary Operations Group at the base when the little-publicized outage lasted for two to three days. ""That's a big impact,"" he said, describing how U.S. pilots had to fly the missions instead.","The article discusses the presence of Russian ships near undersea cables and raises concerns about the potential for these cables to be cut or tapped.

The network is often imagined as a form that routes around or bypasses chokepoints, but all networked systems still have at least one chokepoint. In most cases, they contain many bottlenecks, pressure points, and points of failure. This is true even for apparently distributed systems like the internet.

Our undersea cable system forms the backbone of the global internet. The most frequently discussed and debated chokepoints in this system are geopolitical chokepoints. For example, if one looks at the map of the undersea cable system, it’s easy to locate where cable routes funnel through narrow geographic zones. These include the Strait of Malacca, the Strait of Luzon, and the crossing of Egypt and the Red Sea. At each of these points, cable traffic is rendered vulnerable not only because of geographic constraints but also political constraints that make it difficult to route elsewhere.

The potential effects of these chokepoints on the internet are enormous. A single disaster in such an area could cause catastrophic loss of regional and global connectivity. The most significant of the cable chokepoints is in Egypt. Sunil Tagare, CEO of OpenCables Inc., points out, “Egypt is the biggest single-point failure in the world.”

While geopolitical chokepoints emerge because cables are unable to route elsewhere, topological chokepoints are formed because traffic tends to cluster at particular nodes. These narrow routes are formed not according to the logic of avoidance but due to the laws of attraction. No matter how quickly and smoothly traffic routes through network hubs, they also are vulnerable sites.

Another form of invisible chokepoint is the regulatory chokepoint, where national or international laws and regulations slow and even block internet traffic. The regulations in India and Indonesia point to another potential site of failure—the inability to secure labor to sustain a system. Every network depends on a set of workers, and workers that are integral to network operations can constitute a chokepoint in labor.

Systems depend on other systems. As a result, chokepoints cascade. Undersea cables, and their varied chokepoints, constitute the weak link of other networks: air transportation, shipping, and global financial networks. What might seem to be a minor chokepoint in one system can become a more significant chokepoint in a system that depends on it.","The article 'Strangling the Internet' by Nicole Starosielski extensively discusses undersea cables, their vulnerabilities, and the implications of potential disruptions.

It mentions specific chokepoints and their effects on global connectivity, fitting the criteria for being on the topic of cut sea cables.

The author highlights that a single disaster at these chokepoints could lead to significant internet outages, making it a central theme of the article."
"UK Armed Forces Chief Advocates Navy Expansion to Protect Underwater Cables from Russian Threats","Calls for increased naval strength to defend vital underwater cables, crucial for global communications, against potential Russian sabotage.","https://www.telecomstechnews.com/news/2017/dec/15/armed-forces-uk-navy-underwater-cables-russia","2017-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","Telesoft",Yes,"Telesoft","Blandford, Dorset, United Kingdom","5000","2017-12-15","English",-,"**Armed Forces Chief: UK must boost its navy to defend underwater cables from Russia**

Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach has warned the UK must boost its naval forces to counter the Russian threat to underwater cables.

Russia’s modernised navy has often been spotted near to underwater communications cables in the Atlantic. The economic reliance on these cables makes them a prime target.

Britain’s economy is around 80 percent service-based and relies on underwater cables to conduct business. Peach told the Royal United Services Institute think tank: ""Imagine a scenario where those cables are cut or disrupted which would immediately and potentially catastrophically affect both our economy and other ways of living.""

""Therefore, we must continue to develop our maritime forces — with our allies — to match Russian fleet modernisation.""

Underwater cables are difficult to protect. A report by Policy Exchange found that 97 percent of international communications are conducted over undersea cables and they’re vulnerable to sabotage due to ""minimal protection"".

These cables were often a target during Soviet times, and recent activity suggests they could be again in any offensive launched today. For perspective, these cables are responsible for around £7tn worth of financial transactions per day.

""We can do some things about it, but not enough because our anti-submarine warfare capability has been seriously neglected. The anti-submarine warfare package has been underfunded and has not been looked after well enough.""

**Defence spending cuts**

The UK’s current government, the Conservative Party, has been criticised for its austerity policies which have included significant cuts to defence spending. The opposition party, Labour, has accused the Conservatives of ""shilly shallying around"" with defence spending after former military chiefs warned Britain is losing the ability to fight wars.

Labour MP Dan Jarvis, a war veteran who served in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo and Northern Ireland, said: ""Tory MPs should not be trumpeting their record on defence. They should be embarrassed by the disgraceful damage their party has done to our armed forces.""

""Britain’s defences under Tory leadership are almost unrecognisable compared to how they were left by the last Labour government. Our Army has been seriously reduced, undermining our ability to react to a changing threat from state enemies and international terrorism.""

Army numbers have fallen from 102,000 to just below 80,000. The party has been afflicted by in-fighting after concerns the Army are nearly 4,000 full-time troops short of its target strength. Furthermore, a policy paper by the Henry Jackson Society indicates that full-time army numbers could be cut from 78,000 to 70,000 and savings totalling up to £20bn are being mooted by paring back numbers of Royal Marines, aircraft, and amphibious assault ships.

The same report says the UK must increase its spending on defence to three percent of GDP to counter rising global threats. James Rogers, who authored the Henry Jackson report, says in the face of a ""revisionist Russia"" that Britain needs to take military power more seriously and its ""armed forces therefore require resources consummate with the new geopolitical reality.""

**What are your thoughts about the defence of underwater cables? Let us know in the comments.**","The article discusses the importance of underwater cables and the potential catastrophic effects if they are cut or disrupted, emphasizing their vulnerability to sabotage.

It directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables and the need for protection against threats, particularly from Russia.

Therefore, it meets the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables."

At a time when more than 95% of everything that moves on the global Internet passes through just 200 undersea fiber-optic cables, potential adversaries such as the US, Russia, China and Iran are focusing on these deep-sea information pipes as rich sources of intelligence as well as targets in war.

The weapons earmarked for the struggle include submarines, underwater drones, robots and specialized ships and divers. The new battlefield is also a gray legal zone: Current Law of the Sea conventions cover some aspects of undersea cables but not hostile acts.

There’s evidence that missions are already under way and that most big powers, including the US, are keen on engaging in such activities. Cables can also be attacked by terrorists and other non-state actors.

The damage from such hard-to-detect acts could be enormous, since a foe’s economy, in addition to military and diplomatic communications, could be blinded. As more nations exploit the Internet for political or military gain, it’s also clear that the tactical concept of undersea cables as critical assets to be attacked or defended is an idea whose time has come.

“In the most severe scenario of an all-out attack upon undersea cable infrastructure by a hostile actor the impact of connectivity loss is potentially catastrophic, but even relatively limited sabotage has the potential to cause significant economic disruption and damage,” a former commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, retired US Navy Admiral James Stavridis, wrote in the foreword to a recent report, “Undersea Cables: Indispensable, Insecure.”

It’s hard to overstate the importance and vulnerability of the world’s undersea cables. Rishi Sunak, the Conservative British member of Parliament who authored the December report, noted that the world’s undersea Internet cables carried about US$10 trillion of financial transactions in a single day as well as huge volumes of data, from e-mails to classified government-to-government information.

“Were the network to disappear, the entire capacity of the Earth’s satellite network could handle just 7% of the communications currently sent via cable from the United States alone,” Sunak wrote.

**Asian chokepoints**

Chokepoints where cables converge because of underwater terrain or other factors are especially vulnerable. One is the Luzon Strait near the Philippines, where all the undersea cables connecting Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan pass. The site’s vulnerability was underscored on December 26, 2006, when an undersea landslide severed six cables, temporarily disrupting Internet traffic throughout the region.

In the US, the bulk of trans-Atlantic Internet bandwidth comes ashore at a few sites within a 50-kilometer radius of New York City.

The contours of the new battlefield are enormous: Submarine cables can hug the ocean bottom only a few meters from the surface or straddle abysses as deep as Mount Everest is tall.

The locations of the world’s cables are also well mapped and available online, making them prey for specialized subs, ships, divers or something as simple as grappling hooks.

“Protection of the undersea cables that are an essential – and vulnerable – part of the global economy is yet another potential responsibility for a US Navy that is dangerously overstretched,” Joseph Callo, a naval authority and retired rear admiral in the US Navy Reserve, told Asia Times.

[US intelligence officials contend](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/world/europe/russian-presence-near-undersea-cables-concerns-us.html) that Russia is the chief offender in the new cable war. They have publicly disclosed that Russian submarines are “aggressively operating” near the Atlantic cables that serve the US mainland, as part of an asymmetric-warfare approach.

**US has spy submarine**

However, there are signs that the United States may be engaging in similar activities. In September, the US media reported that the USS Jimmy Carter, a Seawolf-class nuclear submarine equipped for intelligence missions, had returned to its base in Washington state flying a Jolly Roger pirate flag beside the US flag.

Hoisting the skull and crossbones in the US submarine service signals the successful completion of a mission. What was the Jimmy Carter up to? The US Navy didn’t say. But some analysts speculated that the sub, which carries remotely operated vehicles and SEAL (Sea, Air and Land) teams, might have been placing or removing taps on undersea cables.

Covert Shores, a specialist website dedicated to analysis of maritime special forces and submarines, alleged in an updated article in August that the Russian Navy had been operating an advanced spy ship called the Yantar that is suspected of tapping into undersea Internet cables and carrying out other intelligence work on the sea floor.

Yantar “can host two deep submergence submarines for undersea engineering missions,” wrote H I Sutton, the author of the Covert Shores article. “These missions are thought to include cable cutting, laying of taps on undersea cables, removing other countries’ taps (‘delousing’) and related intelligence missions. She may also perform other special missions such as recovery of sensitive equipment from crashed aircraft or test missiles.”

The military website says the Yantar has been observed loitering off the US coast, Cuba, Turkey, Northern Cyprus and other sites where there are key undersea cable connections.

Rob Huebert, a senior fellow at the University of Calgary’s Center for Military and Strategic Studies, points to reports that the Russians have a special mini-submarine launched in 2003 that dives to a very deep range. He says the sub, variously called the Losharik or Project 201 and AS-12, is suspected of being able to carry out cable missions, though this is unconfirmed.

“If the Russians have this, it would be highly likely that both the Chinese and Americans have the same ability,” Huebert told Asia Times.

**Is China involved?**

Actual evidence of Chinese or Iranian participation in cable-focused espionage activities is spotty. The US side points to Chinese activities in the South China Sea and Iranian actions in the Persian Gulf where civilian vessels rather than easily observed military ships with “gray hulls” are being used to carry out unknown activities.

Stavridis noted in his foreword that underwater cables are easy targets for unmarked civilian vessels that can do their work with conventional, non-military technology.

There’s a propaganda spin to such US allegations. But both Beijing and Tehran can be expected to engage in such activities if they see potential foes such as the US developing this capability.

Stavridis says a solution for the US side is to create “dark cables” that aren’t operational but can be kept in reserve for emergencies. He says another option is to engage Russia and others in bolstering international legal protections for undersea cables and other fiber-optic grids.

**Past incidents**

Mysterious disruptions of submarine cables have been reported for years. A flurry of incidents occurred in 2008. Five high-speed Internet cables serving the Middle East and India were hit, resulting in major Internet slowdowns. Speculation was that some damage was caused by a dragging ship anchor near Alexandria, Egypt – though officials said there were no surface vessels in the vicinity at the time.

The Egyptian government also arrested three scuba divers near Alexandria in March 2013 after they were allegedly caught cutting an undersea cable serving the Mediterranean region, causing a noticeable Internet slowdown. The divers claimed they cut the cable by accident. But Egyptian officials never explained what motivated the trio.

The incidents stirred a host of conspiracy theories, including allegations that the US National Security Agency was tapping Internet traffic or that local governments were deliberately slowing online access for protesters using smartphones.

Introduction**  
Contrary to popular belief, the global internet is largely comprised of a network of data cables linking states and continents and not satellite links propelling data through the air. In communications between continents, approximately 99% of all telecommunications is transmitted via a network of around 400 underwater, submarine cables. For example, to send an email from Boston to Dublin, the GTT Atlantic Cable would route your message under the Atlantic Ocean through Nova Scotia, Northern Ireland, and London before arriving in Dublin. This process would take place nearly instantaneously but traverse hundreds of miles of fiber optic cable under the Atlantic Ocean.

These undersea cables are only about the size of a garden hose but represent billions of dollars of productivity and information. If a ship were to drop anchor in the wrong location and sever a cable, internet service could be cut to an entire country. If a rogue agent elected to cut the cables to the United States, an estimated $10 trillion in daily financial transfers and vast amounts of data would be clogged up. Because damage to submarine cables is so devastating, the international community has devised a number of conventions and domestic protections to protect against cable damage.

More insidiously, however, these cables are also at risk of hacking and intelligence gathering because so much data flows through them. States can use submarines to make small slits in submarine cables and insert listening and data collection devices. These spying states then collect all the information that flows through the cables: every overseas telephone call, email, financial transfer, or data upload that passes through the internet from one country to another is collected. Encryption of information that passes through these cables somewhat protects against intelligence gathering, but sophisticated operators can often break encryption and can nevertheless obtain useful information through the metadata embedded in encrypted transmissions. This massive amount of information provides valuable military, economic, and personal information to the hacking country. This hacking, however, is also a violation of citizens’ privacy and a violation of the hacked states’ economic and military interests.

Out of concern for this sort of hacking, in 2020 the U.S. blocked Google and Facebook from turning on a submarine cable linking the U.S. and Hong Kong. Although the 8,000 mile cable had already been laid and hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on its development, the U.S. was too concerned about potential Chinese intelligence pilfering to let the cable go live. The decision dramatically demonstrates the U.S.’s fears around submarine cable hacking have grown to exceptional new heights. And the U.S. government’s fears are not misplaced. In 2013, the British spy agency the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) was found to secretly have tapped into undersea cables to gather information. In 2015, U.S. sensors detected Russian submarines near undersea cables raising concerns. And during the Cold War, the U.S. tapped into Soviet undersea cables and gathered critical intelligence as part of Operation Ivy Bells.

As the world becomes increasingly interconnected and states increasingly rely on the internet economically, hacking into internet infrastructure becomes a greater threat. The U.S., for example, has undertaken expensive and extensive efforts to remove Huawei from its domestic telecommunication infrastructure to prevent the Chinese government from spying domestically. Undersea cables, however, are not so easily protected. Undersea cables are expensive to lay, difficult to replace, and often traverse international waters over which states do not have exclusive domain.

Even with such a large threat, there is an open question as to whether states can protect against submarine cable hacking. The fundamental question this Comment seeks to answer is whether states have any recourse or protections against submarine cable hacking by foreign states under public international law. This Comment argues the increasingly recognized international right to privacy can provide grounds for protecting against submarine cable hacking and that states can enforce this right through dispute resolution mechanisms for the high seas.

This Comment proceeds in five sections to develop this answer. Section II provides a brief overview of the technology behind submarine cables and the methods used in hacking these cables. Section III evaluates current attitudes in the international community with respect to submarine cable hacking and explains why norms around privacy, combined with the incredible resources required to protect cables from hacking, may lead to a shift in states’ treatment of submarine cable hacking.

Section IV explores the history of international treaties and conventions surrounding submarine cables and the high seas. Section V summarizes current public international law related to cyber operations and hacking and discusses the emergence of a newly recognized international right to privacy with respect to telecommunications and personal data. Section VI discusses current scholarly responses to submarine cable hacking to situate this Comment’s solution in present scholarship. And in Section VII, I propose a novel solution addressing the problem of submarine cable hacking using the international right to privacy adjudicated through dispute resolution mechanisms developed for the high seas. The use of the international right to privacy and this dispute resolution body is presently underdiscussed by scholars. This solution further advances the right to privacy as integral to protect against submarine cable hacking and describes how shifts in attitudes toward privacy may contribute to the creation of norms against surveillance hacking.

**II. Technical Primer on Hacking and Submarine Cables**  
This Section describes the network of submarine cables that makes up the modern internet, the technical elements of modern submarine cable hacking techniques, and the possibility of damage by submarine cable hacking. This information is relevant to subsequent possible solutions around submarine cable hacking because international treaties require some protections against incidental or intentional damage to submarine cables, as discussed in Section IV.

Most of the internet is formed through a network of undersea submarine cables. About the size of a garden hose, these cables are buried just under the ocean floor by submarine-cable laying ships and transmit internet data between countries. While there are some legacy cables that transmit primarily telephone or telegraph information, the majority of modern cables are fiber optic cables that can transmit dozens of Terabytes of data per second. While some cables are specially created for military and intelligence transmission purposes, the majority of cables are general in use and transmit commercial, government, and private commercial correspondence simultaneously.

Because laying and operating a cable across large bodies of water is so costly, most cables were historically financed, laid, and operated by a consortium of multiple owners. For example, the U.S., Japan, and Australia agreed in 2020 to jointly finance a cable link to the Pacific island nation of Palau at a cost of $30 billion. Despite this history, individual companies or governments increasingly financed and laid submarine cables. For example, in 2020 Google announced it was financing and constructing its own cable linking the U.S., the United Kingdom, and Spain.

Once laid, cables are maintained and operated by the financing consortium or the private company financing the cable project. These cable operators are responsible for maintenance and repairs for any damage to the cable. Due to their length, most modern cables are outfitted with fault monitoring systems that can detect cable breaks or points of damage for repair.

States are capable of spying on submarine cables. As discussed below, because the hacking of cables requires specialized equipment including submarines, most experts are concerned with government-sponsored hacking attempts. Third-party and private actors, however, are still considered a risk to submarine cables. When four cables linking Europe and the Middle East were simultaneously damaged, many officials and commercial operators alleged private actors had cut the cables. Although more sophisticated technology is required to hack a cable compared to destroying one, the threat of terrorists hacking a submarine cable remains even if not manifest to date.

In general, the process by which intelligence agencies tap into cables is highly secretive. There are some indications, however, as to how it is done. Some reports indicate states use specially designed submarines equipped with devices to splice into cables. In this “splicing method,” the submarine, having broken through the protective coating, installs listening devices within the fiber optic cable to collect transmitted data. Some commentators, however, cast doubt on this method due to the possibility of a cable operator detecting a break in data transmission.","The article discusses submarine cables extensively, addressing their significance in global telecommunications and the potential consequences of physical damage (such as cutting) and hacking.

It mentions that severing a cable could disrupt internet service and financial transactions, indicating that it treats the topic as central.

The use of terms like 'submarine cables' and 'undersea cables' throughout the article further supports its relevance to the criterion."

**The Importance of Submarine Cables**  
Submarine cables are critical to the world economy. They form the basis of the global telecommunications network, the Internet, E-commerce and the world’s financial and security systems. Natural disasters, fishing activities and shipping activities pose a constant threat to submarine cables. It is in the interest of every State to protect submarine cables and to ensure that broken or damaged cables are repaired as quickly as possible. However, despite their crucial role to both the economy and security of all States, many governments lack awareness on the various legal, policy and security issues which arise from the laying, protection and repair of submarine cables.

The legal regime governing submarine cables is set out in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). This paper will outline the UNCLOS legal regime, and point out the areas where its provisions are no longer adequate to protect submarine cables. It will also speculate on the reasons why the legal regime governing submarine cables has been neglected, and set out what measures should be taken by States to address the gaps and loopholes in the current legal regime.

**Submarine Cables and UNCLOS**  
The relevance of UNCLOS  
The first convention on submarine cables was the 1884 Convention for the Protection of Submarine Cables. It was concluded on 14 March 1884 and entered into force on 1 May 1888. Although about 40 States eventually became parties, the only Asian State that is a party is Japan. When the International Law Association and International Law Commission (ILC) reviewed the law of sea in the 1950s, the 1884 Convention was the starting point for their review on submarine cables. Some of its provisions were incorporated into the 1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf. However, the ILC decided not to incorporate some of its other provisions. Therefore, although it had an impact on the development of the international law of the sea relating to submarine cables, the provisions in the 1884 Convention that were not incorporated into the 1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf cannot be considered as evidence of customary international law.

The legal regime governing submarine cables is that set out in UNCLOS. It has been universally accepted and most of its provisions, including those on the submarine cables, can be considered as the best evidence of the rules of customary international law.

**Submarine cables in maritime zones subject to sovereignty**  
Under UNCLOS, coastal States have sovereignty in the 12 nautical mile belt of sea adjacent to their coast known as the territorial sea. Their sovereignty extends to the seabed and subsoil below the territorial sea as well as to the air space above it. Therefore, as a matter of principle, coastal States have the right to regulate all activities in their territorial sea, and their laws and regulations apply to activities in their territorial sea.

The sovereignty of a coastal State in its territorial sea is not unlimited. Article 2(3) of UNCLOS provides that the sovereignty of a coastal State over its territorial sea is exercised subject to UNCLOS and other rules of international law. The main limitations on the sovereignty of the coastal State in the territorial sea relate to the passage of ships. Ships of all States have the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea. In addition, if part of the territorial sea consists of a strait used for international navigation, ships of all States have the right of transit passage through such straits.

Foreign ships have the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea, but such passage must be continuous and expeditious, and ships exercising innocent passage must not engage in any activity not having a direct bearing on passage. If a ship engages in the laying, maintenance or repair of submarine cables in the territorial sea, it would not be exercising the right of innocent passage. Therefore, a coastal State has the right to regulate the laying, maintenance and repair of submarine cables within its territorial sea.

Coastal States also have the right to place restrictions on the right of innocent passage of ships in order to protect submarine cables. Article 21(1)(c) expressly provides that coastal States have the right to adopt laws and regulations restricting the right of innocent passage by ships in order to protect submarine cables.

Article 49 of UNCLOS provides that the sovereignty of an archipelagic State extends to the waters enclosed by its archipelagic baselines, which are referred to as its archipelagic waters. However, such sovereignty is exercised subject to Part IV of UNCLOS. Part IV provides that foreign ships have the right of innocent passage through the archipelagic waters of the archipelagic States, as well as the right of archipelagic sea lanes passage through designated sea lanes or routes normally used for international navigation. The rules on innocent passage through archipelagic waters are the same as those on innocent passage through the territorial sea. Therefore, as a general principle, archipelagic States have the right to regulate the laying, maintenance and repair of submarine cables within their archipelagic waters as well as within their territorial sea. In addition, archipelagic States have the right to regulate ships exercising innocent passage through their archipelagic waters in order to protect submarine cables as provided for in Article 21(1)(c) of UNCLOS.","The article 'Submarine Cables – A Neglected Area of the Law of the Sea' by Robert Beckman discusses submarine cables extensively, covering their critical role in global telecommunications, the legal framework governing them under UNCLOS, and the threats they face.

**Introduction**  
Given recent activities by the PLA(N) and the Russian Navy, the matters of seabed warfare and the defense of undersea infrastructure have emerged as topics of interest to the U.S. Navy. This paper presents several significant considerations regarding the challenges of integrating the deep sea into maritime warfare.  

**The Deep Ocean Environment**  
The term ""deep ocean"" refers to the ocean bottom and the water column deeper than about 3,000 feet. The U.S. Navy's capabilities in this domain are extremely limited. The Navy must develop capabilities to sense, understand, and act in the deep ocean, as current frameworks are insufficient to control this domain.  

The Navy has extensive capabilities in the air domain but lacks comparable capabilities in the deep ocean. The cost of undersea technology has decreased, allowing private entities to operate in this space.  

**Challenges of Sensing and Acting in the Deep Ocean**  
Finding objects on the ocean floor is incredibly difficult, as demonstrated by the search for Malaysian Airlines flight MH-370. The deep ocean presents both area and point challenges that maritime forces must address.  

**Conclusion**  
The deep ocean is a critical and vulnerable area requiring focused military attention and capability development to ensure the security of undersea infrastructure, including telecommunications cables, which are vital for global connectivity.","The article discusses 'undersea infrastructure' and includes a figure depicting 'Global Undersea Telecommunications Cables.' It addresses the vulnerabilities of these cables in the context of seabed warfare, highlighting their importance and the challenges in defending them.

Although it does not specifically mention 'cut sea cables,' the implications regarding the impact on internet connectivity and the strategic importance of these cables are clear.

Therefore, the article satisfies the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables."

By Dmitry Filipoff  
Last week CIMSEC published a series of articles focusing on the seabed as an emerging domain of maritime conflict and competition. This topic week was launched in partnership with the U.S. Naval War College’s Institute for Future Warfare Studies who drafted the Call for Articles. Authors assessed the legal frameworks related to seabed operations, the operational flexibility that can be exercised through this domain, the challenges of protecting critical seabed infrastructure, and more. Below is a list of articles that featured during the topic week and we thank the authors for their excellent contributions.  
  
1. **Fighting for the Seafloor: From Lawfare to Warfare** by LTJG Kyle Cregge  
“…the United States will have to determine how it will shape its own law-based national security strategy considering America’s failure to ratify UNCLOS. At the operational level, seabed UUVs will likely lead to an arms race given all of the discrete tactical opportunities they offer. In an inversion of land warfare, control of the low ground will grant victory on the high seas.”  
  
2. **Forward…from the Seafloor?** by David Strachan  
“One such operation experiencing a kind of renaissance is mine warfare which, when combined with unmanned technologies and key infrastructure based on the ocean floor, transforms into the more potent strategic tool of seabed warfare. But even the concept of seabed warfare is itself in transition, and is on track to be fully subsumed by the broader paradigm of autonomous undersea warfare.”  
  
3. **Establish a Seabed Command** by Joseph LaFave  
“A Seabed Command would focus entirely on seabed warfare. It could unite many of the currently disparate functions found within the surface, EOD, aviation, and oceanographic communities. Its purview would include underwater surveying and bathymetric mapping, search and recovery, placing and finding mines, testing and operating unmanned submersibles, and developing future technologies that will place the U.S. on the forefront of future seabed battlegrounds.”  
  
4. **Undersea Cables and the Challenges of Protecting Seabed Lines of Communication** by Pete Barker  
“Deep below the waters, travelling at millions of miles per hour, flickers of light relay incredible quantities of information across the world, powering the exchange of data that forms the internet. From urgent stock market transactions to endless videos of cats, undersea cables support many aspects of twenty first century life that we take for granted. A moment’s thought is sufficient to appreciate the strategic importance of this fact. As a result, any discussion of future seabed warfare would be incomplete without a consideration of the challenges presented by ensuring the security of this vital infrastructure.”

The undersea consortium is owned by various international companies such as ATT, and these companies provide high-speed broadband connectivity and capacity for large geographic areas that are important entities of trade and communications around the globe. If undersea cables were cut or disrupted outside of the U.S. territorial waters, even for a few hours, the capability of modern U.S warfare that encompasses battle space communications and awareness, protection, and the stability of the financial networks would be at risk.

Douglas Burnett, a legal expert on undersea cables notes that international banking institutions process over $1 trillion dollars per day via undersea cables. Any disruptions of these cables would severely impact global banking. Indeed, Stephen Malphrus, Chief of Staff to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, recently noted, “When communication networks go down, the financial services sector does not grind to a halt, rather it snaps to a halt. Even though there are hundreds of cables crossing the global seabed, there are just not enough undersea communication network redundancies available to handle the vast amount of bandwidth needed to keep global banking transactions in check.

Destruction of submarine cables can cripple the world economy to include the global financial market and/or Department of Defense (DoD). An example which reflects the importance of this strategic communication capability took place on December 26, 2006, when a powerful earthquake off Southern Taiwan cut 9 cables and took 11 repair ships 49 days to restore. The earthquake affected Internet links, financial markets, banking, airline bookings and general communications in China, Hong Kong, India, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan and the Philippines. When a cable loses service, it has a definite, but difficult impact to the global financial sector. The International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) legal advisor estimates that interruptions of underwater fiber optics communications systems have a financial impact excess of $1.5 million per hour.

Submarine cables represent critical communications infrastructure, as they form the backbone of the Internet and global e-commerce. Such cables, typically consisting of optical fibers laid along the ocean floor in a bundle no larger than a garden hose, carry over 95 percent of transoceanic voice and data communication. U.S. telecom companies have worked rapidly to meet exploding consumer appetite for data, increasing the total circuit capacity of transoceanic cables landing in the U.S. by more than 1,000 fold since 1995.

In the end, whatever vigor is applied towards cyber security, and whatever balance is struck for internet freedoms should be matched by securing the very cables that transport this life-blood of commerce. Likewise, investment in energy independence should correspond to the security of the very arteries that enable and spur offshore energy exploration.","The article 'Underseas cables are vital to global economy' discusses the critical role of undersea cables, including direct references to their potential disruptions and the severe implications of such events.

But those cables may soon no longer be enough to satisfy the global demand for bandwidth between the two continents, according to research out today from TeleGeography. The research firm estimates that bandwidth requirements will grow 33 percent between 2008 and 2015, and trans-Atlantic capacity will be exhausted by 2014.

The report also notes that the wave of bankruptcies caused by the oversupply of trans-Atlantic fiber during the boom artificially lowered the cost of providing bandwidth on those cables because many of the pipe providers were able to erase their cable construction debts. That’s good for the current customers who now pay lower prices for transporting their bits, but it means current prices don’t take into account the construction cost of the cables. So future customers will likely see some price increases on wholesale bandwidth as pipe operators add more capacity, and find themselves paying for expensive optical infrastructure. It’s a good thing that this undersea cable buildout is expected to be cheaper than the last one. From the report:

> Consequently, current wholesale rates of approximately $14,000 per month for a 10 Gbps wavelength reflect only the incremental cost of the optical equipment needed to provision the circuit, but not the cost of cable construction. “Trans-Atlantic cable operators and wholesale buyers are facing a slow-motion crisis,” said TeleGeography analyst Alan Mauldin. “The cost of circuits on a new cable built today would be far higher than prices prevailing in the market.”

TeleGeography argues that while 2014 is still five years off, lengthy cable financing and construction cycles mean that carriers must confront this challenge soon. Cable operators may be able to extend their existing infrastructure by using 40 Gbps transmission line rates, but these technologies are unproven on a commercial long-haul submarine cable, and will only postpone the need to lay new fiber.","The article 'The Coming Trans-Atlantic Bandwidth Crunch' discusses the implications of undersea cables, referencing them directly and exploring their historical context and future challenges.

The UK must do more to protect the indispensable, yet insecure Internet infrastructure provided by undersea cables, urges Rishi Sunak MP in a new report published by Policy Exchange.  

The report ‘Undersea Cables: Indispensable, insecure’ says that 97 percent of global communications and $10 trillion in daily financial transactions are transmitted through cables lying deep beneath the ocean. Undersea cables are the indispensable infrastructure of our time, essential to our modern life and digital economy, yet they are inadequately protected and highly vulnerable to attack at sea and on land, from both hostile states and terrorists.  

US intelligence officials have spoken of Russian submarines ‘aggressively operating’ near Atlantic cables as part of its broader interest in unconventional methods of warfare. When Russia annexed Crimea, one of its first moves was to sever the main cable connection to the outside world.  

Undersea cables come ashore in just a few remote, coastal locations. These landing sites are critical national infrastructure but often have minimal protection, making them vulnerable to terrorism.  

**The report recommends that:**  
- The next UK Strategic Defence and Security Review should specifically address threats to Britain’s security from attacks on undersea cable infrastructure;  
- The Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure should quickly review and improve security at UK landing sites where cables come ashore;  
- Britain and NATO must ensure their maritime resources are adequate to deal with this new threat to our security;  
- The UK government should work with private communications companies to install more backup ‘dark cables’ and improve monitoring at sea;  
- The UK should follow the example of Australia and New Zealand and establish Cable Protection Zones around the highest value communications corridors;  
- The UK must lead efforts to develop a new international treaty to protect undersea cables.

No technology is as profoundly important to the global economy as the internet, which is dependent on the security of a vast network of some 750,000 miles of seabed cables that criss-cross the oceans’ depths. The interdependence of global submarine communication systems means that a break in one cable can have cascading effects on internet access to distant states. While the rules to protect this critical infrastructure in peacetime should be refurbished, the need to further develop the rules to secure this global infrastructure during periods of armed conflict is perhaps even more compelling. Although several peacetime treaties protect submarine cables from disruption and criminal acts, albeit weakly, the rules that apply during naval war are even more antiquated. Because the law of naval warfare is principally based on custom and state practice rather than treaties, there is considerable uncertainty over how submarine cables would fare in conflict at sea.

The internet facilitates $10 trillion in international financial transactions daily; submarine cables are the backbone of this distributed, global infrastructure. The critical importance of cables underscores the debate within Western states over the prudence of working with the Chinese communications conglomerate Huawei Marine. Russia and China both view submarine cables as strategic assets and could either tap them or sever them in any future conflict. Russia’s surface ship Yantar, for example, is monitored by Western naval forces since it is outfitted with cable-cutting gear and deep-sea submersibles.

The principal treaty governing submarine cables, adopted in 1884, sets forth an enlightened and balanced approach that is still followed today. The treaty is supplemented by the 1958 Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf and the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). While Article 2 of the 1884 treaty criminalizes the breaking or injury of submarine cables done intentionally or through “culpable negligence” that results in disruption of telecommunication services, Article 4 requires cable owners and operators to indemnify each other for damaged cables and, under Article 7, pay for lost anchors and fishing nets sacrificed in order to avoid cutting a cable.

The 1958 convention recognizes that coastal states have sovereign rights over the resources of the seabed. These rights inhere to the coastal state, regardless of its ability to “occupy” the seabed, access the resources or exercise control over the area. This recognition of coastal state rights codified the U.S. claim in the 1945 Truman Proclamation, which had crystallized into customary international law. Article 4 of that treaty ensures that coastal states may not impede the laying or maintenance of submarine cables or pipelines on their continental shelves. Laying submarine cables is a high seas freedom, and Article 2(4) of the treaty recognizes that all states have a right to do so, while exercising “reasonable regard” for other states—such as the coastal state. The act of laying submarine cables is also a high seas right under the peacetime rules reflected in Article 112 of UNCLOS. States are required to adopt necessary laws and regulations to address willful or culpably negligent damage to cables in accordance with Article 113. Articles 114 and 115 of UNCLOS reflect the long-standing regime of liability and indemnity and are derived from the 1884 treaty. Even in peacetime, as set forth by the rules reflected in UNCLOS, the submarine cable system is fragile. The International Cable Protection Committee—an industry group that represents 97 percent of submarine cables—has reported coastal state delays and exorbitant costs, such as those imposed by India and Indonesia, that hinder undersea cable repairs on their continental shelves. China has a lax record of enforcement against its fishing vessels that cut submarine cables.

While Article 10 of the 1884 treaty specifies that warships and other government vessels have a right to verify the nationality of a merchant vessel if it is suspected of having broken a submarine cable, this provision is a departure from the concept of exclusive flag state jurisdiction over ships, as embodied in Article 92 of UNCLOS. Still, it is also possible to suggest that Article 10 persists even now by virtue of Article 30 of the 1958 convention, which states that prior agreements already in force shall continue. Thus, the rule that states may approach and visit merchant vessels to investigate cut or damaged cables may still apply to states party to the 1884 convention and the 1958 convention, or perhaps more broadly under customary international law.

While these peacetime instruments are rather dated and would benefit from new agreements to increase penalties for tampering and other criminal acts that disrupt their operation, the rules that apply during armed conflict are perhaps even more uncertain. The 1907 Hague Regulations forbid seizure or destruction of submarine cables connecting an occupied territory to a neutral territory, except in the case of “absolute necessity.” Furthermore, cut cables must be restored and compensation paid once the conflict is over. Not only does this exception practically negate the rule, but the regulations themselves apply only to war on land—occupied land at that—and are silent on destruction of cables in the open sea. State practice is clear, however, that cables connecting two points in enemy territory (or two enemy states) may be cut.

Article 15 of the 1884 treaty states that the rules on submarine cables do not “affect the liberty of action” of belligerent states during armed conflict. This is amplified in Rule 37 in the influential San Remo Manual on the Law Applicable to Conflict at Sea, which states that parties to a conflict shall “take care” to avoid damaging submarine cables and pipelines laid on the seabed that serve neutral states. Article 54 of the 1913 Oxford Manual of the Laws of Naval War prohibits cutting cables in neutral waters connecting neutral states with an enemy state. Such cables may be cut on the high seas only if the belligerent state doing so is conducting an effective blockade of the enemy state. Yet, even the Oxford Manual cautions that seizure or destruction of a submarine cable may not be done unless there is an “absolute necessity.” This rule applies without discrimination as to nationality of the owner of the cable, whether a natural person or corporate entity. Recently, the 2020 Oslo Manual on Select Topics on the Law of Armed Conflict recognized in Rule 67 that states that have laid submarine cables or pipelines, or whose nationals have done so, are “entitled to take protective measures” to prevent or terminate “harmful interference” of them.

It is unclear, however, the extent to which the rules set forth in the Oxford, San Remo and Oslo manuals, weak as they are, reflect the understanding of states. In short, the content of the law is murky. Further, the willingness of states to acknowledge even the rather circumspect restraints from customary law on their conduct during armed conflict at sea is doubtful. And while legal practitioners and scholars might devise some clarity, such as through the ongoing revision process of the San Remo Manual, the challenge of more crisply defining rights and duties of states concerning submarine cables is daunting. In the meantime, states may expect that adversaries’ plans to disrupt international submarine cables during naval warfare are limited only by their national laws and their imagination.","The article 'Submarine Cables in the Law of Naval Warfare' extensively discusses submarine cables, including their critical role in global communications and the implications of their disruption.

**Author:** Eoin Micheál McNamara  
**Published Date:** 28 August 2024  

Undersea infrastructure is vital in a global economy powered by data. 99% of the world’s data is transmitted through a global network of subsea cables. An estimated USD 10 trillion in financial transactions alone traverses these vast cable networks each day. As great power tensions escalate, undersea infrastructure serving the Euro-Atlantic community has emerged as an attractive target for hybrid interference, meaning that the security of this infrastructure should be a NATO priority.

Economic logic indicates that undersea infrastructure will remain vital for both global commerce and security into the foreseeable future. However, mitigating risk by finding secure alternative transit for these undersea supplies entails complicated economic and logistic predicaments. NATO members will continue to develop these alternative pathways, but in order to maintain the security of data and energy supplies, they must focus on reinforcing the protection of critical undersea infrastructure.

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) differentiates between the territorial waters of maritime countries, international waters, and Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs). Limited to 12 nautical miles from a country’s coastline, territorial waters bestow full sovereign rights, but specific responsibilities for security are much vaguer under UNCLOS for the vast sections of undersea infrastructure intersecting international waters or the EEZs of multiple countries.

Harsh maritime conditions offer some coincidental protection. Many undersea communication cables connecting North America and Europe cross the mid-Atlantic where the average depth is approximately 3,600 metres. This makes it arduous but not impossible for a submarine to interfere. This vast network of approximately 600 cables globally active or planned offers its own form of protection. In the Euro-Atlantic area, density ensures that hostile actors seeking to cause a serious, effective data outage must coordinate simultaneous aggression at multiple undersea cable nodes. A prepared maritime deterrence posture ensures that NATO can deter or respond to an attack like this.

While NATO militaries have an operational advantage in the North Atlantic, Russia’s hybrid tactics can still target cracks where cooperation between EU and NATO members is less developed. If undeterred, it fosters insecurity, creating an environment that advantages the instigator.

Vulnerabilities with maritime infrastructure were starkly highlighted by sabotage to the Nord Stream pipelines in 2022, spurring the creation of NATO’s Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in February 2023. The Cell will “map vulnerabilities, and coordinate efforts between NATO Allies, partners, and the private sector.” Public-private partnerships are vital in reducing undersea vulnerabilities. The Cell is an important framework to bridge cooperation between governments and industry by combining information-sharing with technological, political and business expertise to support improved situational awareness against hybrid threats.

Across 32 Allied countries, NATO faces a multifaceted maritime security environment. While geopolitical tensions rose, the Nord Stream sabotage prompted concerns that similar incidents were set to spiral. NATO must balance this with support for southern members at risk from destabilisation in neighbouring regions connected by maritime zones that facilitate flows in narcotics, illicit weapons and organised crime.

Overall, NATO's proactive measures and international collaborations are crucial for securing undersea infrastructure against evolving threats in a complex geopolitical landscape.","The article discusses the critical role of undersea cables in global data transmission and highlights vulnerabilities associated with them, particularly in the context of hybrid threats from state actors.

It addresses the risks of damage and disruption to these cables, although it does not use the exact phrase 'cut sea cables'.

Over 750 miles of undersea cables anchored to the sea floor connect the world. These cables cross seas and oceans, traversing international waters and national boundaries. But in this era, more so than any other, knowledge is power. Ultimately, those who own these cables will be able to control and monitor the information that passes through them. Not bound to any one territory, who has the right to control these cables?

**Digital Gold**

Internet cables are protected as though they contain gold, and to some extent, they do. Over 95% of precious data flows through those fibres every day—including government correspondence, user profiles, and banking information. Not only are they routinely inspected for external damage from dropped anchors, earthquakes, or even shark bites, but they are also patrolled by their owners to deter any information tapping from foreign governments.

All this is done through the collaboration of private investors, tech companies, and governments. Projects are backed by governments or state-owned companies, and resources are poured into the process of laying down the cables; hundreds of millions of dollars and the most advanced tools and materials all dedicated to building the backbone of the modern world. The operation takes years; authorities need to map the safest route, damage-proof the cables, dig the trenches, and lay down the cables. All this investment is worth it, for they will give access to information abroad and the potential to control the flow of data.

**A key for espionage**

Tapping undersea cables for espionage is not a new idea. Back in the 1970s, submarines were sent on missions like Operation Ivy Bells. Troops were sent down to the bottom of the Sea of Okhotsk in Soviet territorial waters to find a five-inch diameter cable that carried communications between military bases. They installed a 20-foot long listening device on the cable to record Soviet messages. The tap was eventually discovered, and that specific mission had been compromised.

Such operations could still be ongoing beneath the ocean without us knowing. However, with tech giants quickly gaining control of more and more cables, there could be a new way to spy on other countries. Partnerships or deals with these companies can easily give governments access to the information that flows through the cables, giving Facebook and Google even more leverage than they already have. With state backing and investment, tech giants could control and sell more information, and they could even persuade governments since they own the cables that deliver their secrets. For example, Google could restrict access to information vital for national security interests if governments refuse to give them more tax exemptions.

**Cable Ownership**

These cables run through international territory, muddying the question of ownership. It begs the question: are sections of these cables subject to the local laws of the territories they cross?

Private companies will argue that they’re private property and thus subject to solely the company’s control. However, they still must comply with international laws and treaties regarding marine territory. According to Article 87 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), states have the freedom to lay submarine cables and pipelines in international waters, and only areas that cross into sovereign territory (the Exclusive Economic Zone [EEZ] or continental shelf) are subject to restrictions. Article 112 stipulates that the freedom to lay down cables must be subject to the rights of other states to do the same. Once in the sovereign state’s territorial sea (12 nautical miles from the coast), companies who piloted the project are required to possess various permits, licenses, and environmental agreements according to local laws and international treaties before operating within the country.

While ownership of the cables themselves vary from company to company (state-owned or private), tech giants like Facebook and Google are quickly taking over the seas. By 2020, both companies will own about 29% of the cables that run throughout the world; they even own a couple of whole cables from end-to-end. For instance, Google currently owns the entirety of the Curie cable, which runs from Chile to Los Angeles.

With tech giants taking over, international and local laws need to be updated to ensure that the sovereignty of the different states the cables cross is protected. It’s a unique position they currently occupy: the cables are privately-owned but are allowed to traverse sovereign territory. States are subject to the international treaties they signed, but private companies’ hands are not as bound. UNCLOS awards states the right to lay down internet cables, and this extends to their residents. However, since cable ownership cannot be determined easily by flying a flag, it’s difficult to hold a single company accountable. While they still need permits to lay down the cables, the information they collect can be considered property of the owner. This gives private companies significant leverage over governments. If current regulations are not updated, tech companies have the potential to gain a monopoly over our data, and governments may find it more and more difficult to control their behaviour.

**China and the South China Sea**

All this considered, China’s presence in the South China Sea is even more intimidating. As they continue to take control over the various islands in the area, they will be able to lay down their own network cables away from the eyes of the international community. Their goals to expand their 5G networks, headed by Huawei, will give the Chinese government even more control over the information that flows into and out of the country. The infamous Great Firewall can be expanded and improved further if the state has complete control over the internet cables that source internet traffic. Tapping the cables will no longer be necessary for espionage if the state owns the whole thing.

The Huawei Marine Networks has already begun to lay down 100 submarine cables across the world, and it completed a 4,000-mile cable last year that runs from Brazil to Cameroon. China Unicom, the company that owns the cable, was able to win the bidding because of the subsidies they received from the government. Possession of the South China Sea could mean the control over the data that flows between surrounding countries. A monopoly on the network can give China the intelligence and leverage necessary to control such regions. China, however, is simply taking a page from American books. Former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed PRISM to the public: a program wherein the U.S. government collected user data from various internet companies, and they could do so without a warrant. Global superpowers know that intelligence is the key to control, so they have been working with telecommunication companies for years, whether it be through under-the-table deals or direct partnerships. The danger with China’s case, however, is the way they are attempting to circumvent international regulations and norms. By annexing islands in the South China Sea, they can claim that it is within their sovereign territory. Therefore, international bodies cannot interfere with their desire to lay down new internet cables. They would technically be operating within their rights even though their operations would affect all of the Southeast Asian countries. Huawei’s 5G networks would spread across the region, so it will be more and more difficult to use non-Chinese servers. Accompanied by its economic influence over the area, China will reinforce its position as hegemon of the continent with their increasing control over data.","The article discusses undersea cables and their vulnerabilities, including potential espionage and external threats, which are relevant to the topic of cut sea cables.

Welcome to a special IT Blogwatch EXTRA: as Richi Jennings watches bloggers watch another cluster of undersea-cable severment. Not to mention how Ukrainians sell ringtones…

**Robert McMillan reports:**

> Internet and telephone traffic between Europe, the Middle East and Asia was hampered today after three major underwater data lines were cut … in the Mediterranean Sea that connect Sicily to Tunisia and Egypt … which connect countries between Singapore and France as well as the Flag Telecom cable route, which stretches from the U.K. to Japan.
> 
> A maintenance boat is en route to the site of the cut, but it will not get there until Monday, and it will take as many as two weeks for the situation to return to normal … Many countries were affected by the outage, including India, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Malaysia.

**Aunty Beeb adds:**

> It is thought the FLAG FEA, SMW4, and SMW3 lines, near the Alexandria cable station in Egypt, have all been cut. A fault was also reported on the GO submarine cable 130km off Sicily.
> 
> The cause of the break is as yet unknown, although some seismic activity was reported near Malta shortly before the cut was detected.
> 
> Experts warned that … the knock on effect could have serious repercussions on regional economies.

**Kim Zetter walks like an Egyptian:**

> The cuts are causing traffic to be re-routed through the United States and elsewhere … the outage has almost completely killed internet services throughout Egypt.
> 
> The SMW 4 and FLAG cables were among five undersea cables damaged earlier this year in January and February in the Mediterranean, launching a flurry of conspiracy theories before investigations revealed that at least one of the cuts was caused by a ship’s anchor.

**Jonathan M. Gitlin worries for international sanity:**

> Many of us are now highly dependent on the Internet in our daily lives. I know it’s essential for my job, and if reports in the medical literature are to be believed, more than a few of us might even be psychologically addicted to that steady stream of digital information.
> 
> The Internet’s … global nature and the infrastructure that pipes it from continent to continent actually makes the whole thing fairly fragile; a well placed fishing net or anchor and whole countries or even regions can be left back in the 1950s, when e-mail sounded like a guy’s name.

**Stacey Higginbotham says the Maltese are cross:**

> It’s unknown if the Malta cable problems are related to these cuts, perhaps from a weather or seismic event. However in the online world the cuts are certainly related in how they will make it that much slower or impossible for users to connect around the world.
> 
> Consider the web not only as physical infrastructure, but also held together by political and economic agreements. It’s like … a like series of treaties that allow trade to various points of the globe. In Malta’s case, an agreement with Vodafone to share its cable kept the physical infrastructure from staying out. But as the Sprint/Cogent peering fight proved, when those agreements fail, the web is vulnerable in a way roads are not.

**Behrooz examines the evidence:**

> Cables going to very close shore landing points between similar destinations tend to be pretty close together, saves significantly on the survey costs. The … timing of the outages … and the relative proximity of the cable courses suggests either anchor drag or someone who cares enough to make it look that way.

**So fuzzyfuzzyfungus theorizes, conspiratorially:**

> I wonder what the going rate is to have a ship drop anchor in the location of your choice? There must be somebody, if you ask around quietly, who would be willing to set up a grubby little shipping company with no real assets worth suing for and have their rusty crap freighter drag an anchor across whatever bit of seabed needs some accidental scraping.

**But Mike “Xaositecte” Avelli thinks not:**

> Even though it never got reported on, the [February] cable cuts were a serious nuisance to American troops stationed in Afghanistan and Iraq at the time too.

Part-1 focussed upon providing an overview of these systems and the vulnerabilities to which they are subject. This concluding segment not only highlights the inadequate protection that these systems receive under international law but also under India’s domestic legislation. To mitigate the several ensuing vulnerabilities, it strongly recommends that submarine communications cables landing in India be included within India’s “Critical Information Infrastructure System” (CIIS), and that India exercise prescriptive jurisdiction over such submarine cables even under the High Seas, under the principle of “protective jurisdiction”. It is hoped that the two parts, taken in aggregate, would be useful to Indian policy-makers and practitioners, as also to legal academic and research institutes in India and the larger Indian Ocean Region. This second part specifically addresses legal authorities of the Indian Navy/Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of External Affairs, as well as India’s national security apparatus.

**Protection under International Law**

Where legal protection to underwater/ submarine communication cables is concerned, the basic issue revolves about the exercise of “jurisdiction”. While surveillance, alerting and warning systems are necessary to prevent human activity from damaging cables in the first place, the existence and robustness of rules and enforcement mechanisms required to ensure deterrence are equally important. However, since much of the damage can occur outside the territory of the concerned State, extending a State’s jurisdiction, especially criminal jurisdiction, is problematic.

Submarine cables (albeit in the form of telegraph cables) have, of course, been around since the 1850s. As early as 1884, the international community understood the need to reach a consensus to protect these cables even in areas outside national jurisdiction. Thus, the ""Convention for the Protection of Submarine Telegraph Cables, 1884"" focussed upon interference with telegraph cables. The jury is still out on whether this treaty has a fundamental norm-creating character and whether it has the force of customary international law. The non-reliance of many articles in the 1884 Convention by the International Law Commission while developing UNCLOS 1982, as also the small number of signatory State Parties are strong arguments against it. The Convention is nevertheless important as it is applicable ""outside territorial waters to all legally established submarine cables landed on the territories… of one or more of the High Contracting Parties"" and hence sets a precedent for the exercise of jurisdiction. Article 2 of this Convention made the breaking or injury of a submarine cable, done wilfully or through culpable negligence that results in partial or total interruption in telegraphic communication, a punishable offence. While Article 8 of the Convention adheres to the principle of Flag State jurisdiction by providing competence to take cognizance of the offence, to the Flag State of the vessel aboard which the infraction took place, Article 10 empowers other High Contracting Parties to collect evidence for violations of this Convention and transmit them to the Flag State.

The attribution of jurisdiction was, however, slightly altered with the coming into force of the 1982 UNCLOS, due to the newly created/clarified maritime zones and the rights within these zones, which were afforded to coastal States. The coastal State has sovereignty in its Territorial Sea and is competent to enact rules and regulations to protect submarine cables within its Territorial Sea (Article 21(c) UNCLOS). The jurisdiction of the coastal State in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), however, is limited to the exercise of ‘sovereign rights’ with respect to the exploration and exploitation of resources. Therefore, the coastal State may restrict only such activities within its EEZ over which it has jurisdiction. This has been used effectively by Australia and New Zealand by creating ‘cable protection zones’ in which certain activities are restricted in an area declared as such with respect to identified submarine cable(s). Schedule 3 of the Telecommunications Act (Australia), inter alia, prohibits anchoring and the use of trawls and other fishing gear designed to work on the seabed, within these ‘cable protection zones’. This has been done to prevent bottom fishing or any such activity in these areas that may cause damage to a submarine cable. Similarly, Section 12 and Section 13 of the ""Submarine Cables and Pipelines Protection Act, 1996"" of New Zealand, empower the Governor-General to declare an area — including within the EEZ — a ‘protected area’ within which fishing operations and anchoring of a ship is an offence. In this way, a common cause of damage to submarine communication cables has been sought to be addressed.

However, the issue of intentional human damage does not get addressed by this measure. UNCLOS, 1982, does provide for measures for the protection of submarine cables on the High Seas but affords jurisdiction to the Flag State of the vessel/nationals that effect the protection. Article 113 of the UNCLOS, in terms similar to those of the 1885 Convention, obligate the Flag State exercising jurisdiction over nationals/vessels to adopt laws and regulations necessary to provide that the breaking or injury of a submarine cable below the high seas, or any conduct calculated or likely to result in such breaking or injury, done wilfully or through culpable negligence, is a punishable offence if it obstructs telegraphic or telephonic communications. Article 58(2) UNCLOS extends this provision and makes it applicable within the EEZ as well.

This notwithstanding, there has been very poor compliance, with this provision, with the majority of States, including the Republic of India, not having enacted any comprehensive domestic legislation to this effect. Even a liberal reading of the 1988 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (SUA) would, at a minimum, require ""Flag State authorisation"" and give preference to ""Flag State jurisdiction"". It would appear that submarine cables fall into a legal gap and are left inadequately protected, particularly in the absence of vigorous measures to enact domestic legislation.

It is also not clear whether the State that owns the cables or the nationals of the State(s) which own or have laid the cables, can exercise jurisdiction (criminal or otherwise) over cables laid on the seabed under the high seas. It is quite doubtful, therefore, whether they would be able to enforce their own national laws over an incident damaging ‘their’ submarine cables in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ).","The article discusses underwater communication cables, specifically focusing on their vulnerabilities and the legal protections surrounding them.

By Trevor Hollingsbee - June 2, 2023  

A popular conception is that international communications nowadays rely mainly upon satellites. This, though, is very far from being the case.

There are about 440 undersea cables stretching over a total of 885,000 kilometres. These cables carry some 95 per cent of the world’s communications traffic, and in some cases, even electrical power. This network continues to expand, and it is emerging as a likely priority target in future conflict, particularly as the cables often lie in the vicinity of strategic maritime chokepoints such as the Greenland/UK gap.

**Threats and vulnerabilities**  
Underwater cables are vulnerable to operations by hostile players, including non-state actors. Such forces intend either to monitor classified traffic or to sever the cables in order to disrupt communications or power supply. The extreme depths at which many underwater cables are located demand the deployment of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV).

Russia’s special underwater missions ship _Yantar_ has long been monitored while carrying out seabed operations in Middle Eastern waters and elsewhere. _Yantar_ carries deep-diving manned submersibles as well as remotely operated underwater vehicles, both capable of operating on seabed infrastructure. The ship itself is also equipped with fixed and towed sonar systems for mapping the seabed.

According to reports, some of which are disputed, the Russians cut submarine internet cables leading into Crimea prior to annexing the territory in 2014.

**The “Great Undersea Wall” of China**  
China is increasingly dependent upon undersea cables to support its expanding and modernising economy. To mitigate the cables’ vulnerability, Beijing is planning to establish two protected shore facilities for incoming cables as well as docking stations for UUVs along its pipelines and two specialist “underwater cable ships”.  

Beijing is also pursuing a policy of introducing a “Great Undersea Wall”. This project, led by the China Shipbuilding Corporation, is intended to co-ordinate the operations of UUVs and seabed sensors to maintain underwater cables and to protect them against attack.

**Developments in the US and Britain**  
A number of the “civilian” special mission ships of the US Navy’s Military Sealift Command are engaged in seabed surveillance, particularly in the South China Sea. Furthermore, in order to safeguard its extensive underwater cable network, the US has activated its Forward Deployed Energy and Communications Outposts project.  

A vital component of future US Navy seabed operations will be the Orca-class Extra Large Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (XLUUV), five of which have been ordered from Boeing. The 16-metre Orca has a top speed of eight knots and a range of about 12,000 kilometres. It features a modular design, which is adaptable for a range of underwater missions.  

The UK Royal Navy’s ocean survey vessel _Scott_ reportedly has some seabed warfare capability, and the RN is developing an XLUUV for such operations, with an experimental Manta XLUUV built by M-Subs currently undergoing trials.

**Published Date: 03/30/2018**  

WASHINGTON (AP) — Russian ships are skulking around underwater communications cables, causing the U.S. and its allies to worry the Kremlin might be taking information warfare to new depths.  

Is Moscow interested in cutting or tapping the cables? Does it want the West to worry it might? Is there a more innocent explanation? Unsurprisingly, Russia isn’t saying.  

But whatever Moscow’s intentions, U.S. and Western officials are increasingly troubled by their rival’s interest in the 400 fiber-optic cables that carry most of world’s calls, emails and texts, as well as $10 trillion worth of daily financial transactions.  

“We’ve seen activity in the Russian navy, and particularly undersea in their submarine activity, that we haven’t seen since the ‘80s,” Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of the U.S. European Command, told Congress this month.  

Without undersea cables, a bank in Asian countries couldn’t send money to Saudi Arabia to pay for oil. U.S. military leaders would struggle to communicate with troops fighting extremists in Afghanistan and the Middle East. A student in Europe wouldn’t be able to Skype his parents in the United States.  

All this information is transmitted along tiny glass fibers encased in undersea cables that, in some cases, are little bigger than a garden hose. All told, there are 620,000 miles of fiber-optic cable running under the sea, enough to loop around the earth nearly 25 times.  

Most lines are owned by private telecommunications companies, including giants like Google and Microsoft. Their locations are easily identified on public maps, with swirling lines that look like spaghetti. While cutting one cable might have limited impact, severing several simultaneously or at choke points could cause a major outage.  

The Russians “are doing their homework and, in the event of a crisis or conflict with them, they might do rotten things to us,” said Michael Kofman, a Russian military expert at nonprofit research group CNA Corp.  

It’s not Moscow’s warfighting ships and submarines that are making NATO and U.S. officials uneasy. It’s Russia’s Main Directorate of Deep Sea Research, whose specialized surface ships, submarines, underwater drones and mini subs conduct reconnaissance, underwater salvage and other work.  

One ship run by the directorate is the Yantar. It’s a modest, 354-foot oceanographic vessel that holds a crew of about 60. It most recently was off South America’s coast helping Argentina search for a lost submarine.  

Parlamentskaya Gazeta, the Russian parliament’s publication, last October said the Yantar has equipment “designed for deep-sea tracking” and “connecting to top-secret communication cables.” The publication said that in September 2015, the Yantar was near Kings Bay, Georgia, home to a U.S. submarine base, “collecting information about the equipment on American submarines, including underwater sensors and the unified (U.S. military) information network.” Rossiya, a Russian state TV network, has said the Yantar can not only connect to top-secret cables, but could cut them and “jam underwater sensors with a special system.”  

Russia’s Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.  

There is no hard evidence that the ship is engaged in nefarious activity, said Steffan Watkins, an information technology security consultant in Canada tracking the ship. But he wonders what the ship is doing when it’s stopped over critical cables or when its Automatic Identification System tracking transponder isn’t on.  

Of the Yantar’s crew, he said: “I don’t think these are the actual guys who are doing any sabotage. I think they’re laying the groundwork for future operations.”  

Members of Congress are wondering, too.  

Rep. Joe Courtney, a Connecticut Democrat on a House subcommittee on sea power, said of the Russians, “The mere fact that they are clearly tracking the cables and prowling around the cables shows that they are doing something.”  

Democratic Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, an Armed Services Committee member, said Moscow’s goal appears to be to “disrupt the normal channels of communication and create an environment of misinformation and distrust.”  

The Yantar’s movements have previously raised eyebrows.  

On Oct. 18, 2016, a Syrian telecom company ordered emergency maintenance to repair a cable in the Mediterranean that provides internet connectivity to several countries, including Syria, Libya and Lebanon. The Yantar arrived in the area the day before the four-day maintenance began. It left two days before the maintenance ended. It’s unknown what work it did while there.  

Watkins described another episode on Nov. 5, 2016, when a submarine cable linking Persian Gulf nations experienced outages in Iran. Hours later, the Yantar left Oman and headed to an area about 60 miles west of the Iranian port city of Bushehr, where the cable runs ashore. Connectivity was restored just hours before the Yantar arrived on Nov. 9. The boat stayed stationary over the site for several more days.  

Undersea cables have been targets before.  

At the beginning of World War I, Britain cut a handful of German underwater communications cables and tapped the rerouted traffic for intelligence. In the Cold War, the U.S. Navy sent American divers deep into the Sea of Okhotsk off the Russian coast to install a device to record Soviet communications, hoping to learn more about the USSR’s submarine-launched nuclear capability.  

More recently, British and American intelligence agencies have eavesdropped on fiber optic cables, according to documents released by Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor.  

In 2007, Vietnamese authorities confiscated ships carrying miles of fiber optic cable that thieves salvaged from the sea for profit. The heist disrupted service for several months. And in 2013, Egyptian officials arrested three scuba divers off Alexandria for attempting to cut a cable stretching from France to Singapore. Five years on, questions remain about the attack on a cable responsible for about a third of all internet traffic between Egypt and Europe.  

Despite the relatively few publicly known incidents of sabotage, most outages are due to accidents.  

Two hundred or so cable-related outages take place each year. Most occur when ship anchors snap cables or commercial fishing equipment snags the lines. Others break during tsunamis, earthquakes and other natural disasters.  

But even accidental cuts can harm U.S. military operations.  

In 2008 in Iraq, unmanned U.S. surveillance flights nearly screeched to a halt one day at Balad Air Base not because of enemy mortar attacks or dusty winds. An anchor had snagged a cable hundreds of miles away from the base, situated in the “Sunni Triangle” northwest of Baghdad.  

The severed cable had linked controllers based in the United States with unmanned aircraft flying intelligence, surveillance and recognizance missions for coalition forces in the skies over Iraq, explained Ret. Air Force Col. Dave Lujan of Hampton, Virginia.  

“Say you’re operating a remote-controlled car and all of a sudden you can’t control it,” said Lujan, who was deputy commander of the 332nd Expeditionary Operations Group at the base when the little-publicized outage lasted for two to three days. “That’s a big impact,” he said, describing how U.S. pilots had to fly the missions instead.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, highlighting potential threats from Russian military activities, the implications of cutting these cables on global communications, and historical instances of sabotage.

Breaks in the high capacity fibre optic data cables that link countries around the world together and on the internet, many of which sit on the seabed, are not uncommon. Now a new report has warned that other countries and terrorists could potentially cripple the UK by attacking those.

The threat is by no means new, although today most cable breaks occur due to accidents by deep sea fishing trawlers, ships dragging their anchor over them or marine life deciding to take a nibble. A whole industry exists to repair such cables and it usually takes a few weeks to fix a break, depending upon the type of break, sea depth, weather conditions, and various other factors.

A new paper from the Policy Exchange, authored by Conservative MP Rishi Sunak, warns that when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine, one of its first moves was to cut the main cable connection to the outside world. Similarly, in 2007 an Al-Qaeda plot to destroy a key London internet exchange was foiled.

The report claims that US intelligence officials have highlighted how Russian submarines have been seen ""aggressively operating"" near Atlantic cables as part of their ""broader interest in unconventional methods of warfare"". In addition, undersea cables come ashore in just a few remote locations, which tend to be both public knowledge and softly protected.

Rishi Sunak MP stated: ""A successful attack on the UK’s undersea cable infrastructure would be an existential threat to our security. Yet the exact locations of these cables are both isolated and publicly available – jugulars of the world economy which are a singularly attractive target for our enemies.""

We must do more to protect the indispensable yet insecure internet infrastructure provided by undersea cables, urges Rishi Sunak MP in _Undersea Cables: Indispensable, Insecure_ published by Policy Exchange today.

97% of global communications and $10 trillion in daily financial transactions are transmitted, not by satellites in the skies, but by cables lying deep beneath the ocean. Undersea cables are the indispensable infrastructure of our time, essential to our modern life and digital economy, yet they are inadequately protected and highly vulnerable to attack at sea and on land, from both hostile states and terrorists.

US intelligence officials have spoken of Russian submarines “aggressively operating” near Atlantic cables as part of its broader interest in unconventional methods of warfare. When Russia annexed Crimea, one of its first moves was to sever the main cable connection to the outside world.

Undersea cables come ashore in just a few remote, coastal locations. These landing sites are critical national infrastructure but often have minimal protection, making them vulnerable to terrorism. A foiled Al-Qaeda plot to destroy a key London internet exchange in 2007 illustrates the credibility of the threat.

Since the first trans-Atlantic cable laid in 1858, cables have mainly been installed and owned by private companies. Although positive for taxpayers, this has meant undersea cables do not get the attention from governments they deserve.

The report recommends that:
* The next Strategic Defence and Security Review should specifically address threats to Britain’s security from attacks on our undersea cable infrastructure.
* The Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure should quickly review and improve security at UK landing sites where cables come ashore.
* Britain and NATO must ensure their maritime resources are adequate to deal with this new threat to our security.
* The government should work with private communications companies to install more backup ‘dark cables’ and improve monitoring at sea.
* We should follow the example of Australia and New Zealand and establish Cable Protection Zones around our highest value communications corridors.
* The UK must lead efforts to develop a new international treaty to protect undersea cables.

This report has been endorsed by Admiral James Stavridis, US Navy (Ret), former NATO Supreme Allied Commander; Robert Hannigan, former Security Adviser to the Prime Minister and Director of GCHQ until earlier this year; and General Lord Houghton, former UK Chief of Defence Staff, who stepped down in 2016.

In his Foreword to the report, Admiral Stavridis says:
“It is not satellites in the sky, but pipes on the ocean floor that form the backbone or the world’s economy. We have allowed this vital infrastructure to grow increasingly vulnerable and this should worry us all.

“Over my own career, I have seen the Atlantic transition from being a theater characterized by near complete NATO supremacy to a space that Russia is actively contesting through a resurgent naval doctrine. If the relative weakness of the Russian position makes a conventional conflict with NATO unlikely, it also raises the appeal for them of asymmetric targets like fibre optic cables. We should prepare for increased maritime hybrid activity, not just from Russia, but also from China and Iran.”

Rishi Sunak MP, the author of the report, says:
“A successful attack on the UK’s undersea cable infrastructure would be an existential threat to our security. Yet the exact locations of these cables are both isolated and publicly available – jugulars of the world economy which are a singularly attractive target for our enemies.

“Since the first transatlantic cable was laid in 1858, undersea cables have generally been owned and installed by private companies. Although this is good for taxpayers, it also means that most governments have not given undersea cables enough attention.

“As we debate our future defence priorities, protecting the freedom of the seas and all the lanes of communication on and under them is paramount. Britain and our NATO allies must ensure that our maritime capabilities get the investment they need.","The article discusses the critical role of undersea cables in global communications and highlights their vulnerabilities, including the risks of them being cut or attacked.

It provides specific examples, such as the Russian annexation of Crimea, and emphasizes the need for better protection of this infrastructure.

Therefore, it satisfies the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables."

China has made a significant foray into the Arctic with the creation of a data ""silk road"". Strongly supported by a newfound closeness with Russia, preliminary planning of a Chinese and Finnish–led trans-Arctic cable along the Arctic’s Northeast Passage in partnership with Japan and Norway is underway. But the project, essentially a relaunch of a stagnated Russian initiative, presents stark risks in affording Moscow and Beijing potential influence over global telecommunications.

### Sea Cables 101

Contrary to popular belief, satellites carry very little global data. Sea cables have been an important method of global communication since the mid-19th century. The advent of fibre optics in the 1990s made modern sea cabling even more critical. This vast network, comprising some one million kilometres in total, carries almost all data transfers and facilitates finance transfers of more than $10 trillion dollars every day.

Beyond the significance to the global financial market, sea cables transfer nearly all our global telecommunications data. These cables are a matter of crucial national security.

Historically, sea cables have only been vulnerable to damage from threats related to fisheries, anchors, earthquakes, and tsunamis. Being relatively void of these challenges, at least for now, the Arctic offers a unique environment for sea cables. But the increasingly assertive foreign policy agendas of some states means that these cables are at risk of purposeful interference, as per the emerging “hybrid” security threat.

Russia has already demonstrated interest and ability in exploiting sea cable vulnerabilities. In 2013, little green men cut the sea cable between Crimea and Ukraine – a crucial step in controlling the internet within the annexed territory.

### Advantages of an Arctic Route

The thawing Arctic presents an attractive sea cable route. A trans-Arctic sea cable cuts the distance between Asia and Europe by roughly 40%. The shorter the physical cable distance, the lower the latency (total round-trip data transmission time). Melting ice and developments in technology have prompted a range of feasibility studies into the viability of a trans-Arctic sea cable route. Arctic Council permanent members Canada, Russia, the US, Norway, and Denmark have all, to varying degrees, undertaken assessments of potential Arctic data highways.

To date, two Arctic routes have been touted, yet only one has made it to the development stage. The first route treks along the Northwest Passage, along Canada’s Arctic coastline. This cable links data from London to Tokyo and is well into development. Dubbed “Arctic Fibre”, and consisting of approximately 16,000 kilometres of cable, this route was originally a Canadian venture. In 2016 Arctic Fibre was acquired by Alaska-based firm Quintillion.

Despite slow progress since, in late 2017 the first phase of the network was completed. The 1900-kilometre phase along the Alaskan coast is to be followed by the Asia-Pacific segment. From there, Arctic Fibre’s final phase will be the Canada–United Kingdom link.

The second route follows the Northern Sea Route along the Northeast Passage, hugging Russia’s coastline. Named ROTACS (Russian Optical Trans-Arctic Cable System), the route links London to Tokyo via branches in Russia and Beijing. It is approximately this route that Finland and China have revived and rebranded to meet the expected rise in Europe–Asia data transfer needs.

This recent revival of the ROTACS concept is driven in part by Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The Arctic component of BRI has been pounced on by Russia and Finland, with the former’s interest clearly the realisation of the shelved ROTACS route. As Chair of the Arctic Council, Finland has a key interest in achieving the “connectivity” component of its broader chairmanship theme. Finland’s feasibility study into what it calls an “Arctic Connect” cable concluded that a second trans-Arctic cable would be a win-win-win for Europe, Russia, and Asia. Strong European support for cooperation with Russia in advancing the global technological commons appears to be enough incentive to seek a reset of sorts with the Kremlin.

### The Cable’s Challenges

The majority of sea cables are not state-owned or operated, but instead controlled by private telecommunications firms. There is, therefore, a grey area when it comes to enforcing security of the system.

If a cable is not registered to a nation in its entirety, how can it be sufficiently defended from threats such as hacking, tapping, or even sabotage? In 1982 the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea attempted to allocate legal protection to sea cables. Of course, nations yet to ratify the agreement, including the US, are not bound by such provisions. The best practice for deterring interference, and ultimately protecting the nexus of global sea cables, has proved to be somewhat elusive. Australia is leading the way with the development of Cable Protection Zones (CPZs), but establishing and monitoring wider CPZs in the global high seas would be a far harder task.

Russia’s new Yantar-class submarine has specific capabilities to disrupt cable signals. In 2017 a tabletop exercise was conducted by the Center for a New American Security on sea cable security. This wargame of sorts simulated a Russian attack on NATO sea lines of communication, specifically sea cables off the coast of Iceland. Participants struggled to determine whose responsibility it was to restore the cables – the grey zone between state and private ownership of sea cables was a significant hurdle for policy-makers.

At present, the trans-Arctic cable involves a consortium of state-owned firms. This points to a further potential challenge: the security of data transmission. Finland’s state-owned Cinia Group Oy and China’s state-owned China Telecom are central backers of a trans-Arctic sea cable. Investigating Russian stakeholders in a trans-Arctic cable is where things get a little murky, primarily because this cable route is not new at all. Links to the Kremlin are evident.

Beyond the obvious benefits for Russia, a trans-Arctic sea cable also affords the Kremlin a significant opportunity to demonstrate its role in the development of the Arctic commons. Russia might yet diversify its Arctic economy to take advantage of its vast geographical endowment and strengthen its foothold in the region’s technological, shipping, and transport future. Developing the trans-Arctic sea cable is a legitimate strategic interest for the Kremlin. It is evident that Western sanctions may have driven Russia into Beijing’s arms in seeking finance, even if the Russia–China Arctic link is fraught with mutual suspicion.

Should this newest incarnation of a trans-Arctic sea cable gain traction and reach the development stage, it could offer grounds for an opportunistic outlook for the region. However, due diligence must be paid to data security and the legalities of ownership and operation of sea cables before the route comes online.","The article ""Sea cables in a thawing Arctic"" discusses the geopolitical implications of sea cables, including a direct reference to an incident where Russian forces cut a sea cable between Crimea and Ukraine.

Furthermore, it stresses the importance of these cables for global telecommunications and the potential risks to internet connectivity.

Defendants say Virgin Media failed to ensure that its cables were protected in a long-established fishing ground.

The owners of a fishing trawler which allegedly damaged an undersea fibre optics cable providing internet and telephone connection between Ireland and Britain are being sued in the High Court over the €800,000 cost of repairs.

Virgin Media Wholesale Ltd is suing “the owners and all persons claiming an interest” in the MV The Lida Suzanna trawler over the alleged incident on January 26, 2015, involving damage to the subsea cable stretching 219km between Dublin and Lytham St Anne’s near Blackpool in England.

The vessel was allegedly involved in scallop fishing which involves dredging the seabed.

Virgin, which has registered offices in Hampshire in the UK, is seeking damages and a declaration that a maritime lien, or claim, attaches to the Irish-registered vessel which is based in Wexford. It also seeks an order for its sale if necessary.

The defendants deny the vessel was responsible for causing damage to the cable and require proof of this. It is also contended that Virgin is the author of its own misfortune by not taking sufficient measures to bury or protect its cables.

Alternatively, it claims Virgin was contributorily negligent. There was also an alleged failure to protect its cables in an “area of fishing ground established centuries past”.

The defendants say they were doing nothing more than the lawful exploitation of fishing rights and Virgin has no entitlement to expect or demand that fishing be modified, or stopped by reason of the laying of its cable.

The court heard the cable was installed in 1998 by Virgin’s predecessor NTL. It is one of two cables, the Sirius South and the Sirius North, running between Ireland and Britain and if one is damaged, Virgin can switch to the other. There have been some 18 instances of damage involving trawlers since it was installed.

Repairs were carried out over the following days by the repair ship, the Pierre de Fermat.

Opening the case on behalf of Virgin, Edward Farrelly SC said it was their case that the defendants should have been or ought to have been aware of the location of the cable which is marked on industry-recognised charts and Ireland’s Marine Atlas. Merchant shipping regulations place a statutory duty on the vessel to carry publications which would have alerted it to the location of the cable. It is further alleged there was a failure to ensure the skipper and/or crew were adequately aware of and/or educated about the location of subsea cables.

The case continues before Mr Justice Denis McDonald.","The article discusses a legal case regarding damage to an undersea fiber optics cable, with direct mentions of 'subsea cable' and implications for internet connectivity.

The UK's most senior military officer has warned of a new threat posed by Russia to communications and internet cables that run under the sea.

Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, the chief of the defence staff, said Britain and NATO needed to prioritize protecting the lines of communication.

He said it would ""immediately and potentially catastrophically"" hit the economy if they were cut or disrupted.

The cables criss-cross the seabed, connecting up countries and continents.

The world's submarine network comprises an estimated 213 independent cable systems and 545,018 miles (877,121 km) of fibre, according to a recent report for the Policy Exchange think tank.

But it said a lack of formal state ownership meant cables do not have strong protection in international law.

Despite that, an estimated 97% of global communications and $10 trillion in daily financial transactions are transmitted by cables under the ocean.

Speaking to the Royal United Services Institute defence think tank, Sir Stuart said the vulnerability of undersea lines posed a ""new risk to our way of life"".

He said NATO had prioritized the protection of the cables ""in response to the threat posed by the modernisation of the Russian navy, both nuclear and conventional submarines and ships"".

He said it was ""very, very important"" to understand how crucial that mission was for NATO, ""because Russia in addition to new ships and submarines continues to perfect both unconventional capabilities and information warfare.""

The UK and its allies needed to ""match and understand Russian fleet modernisation"", he added.

Fears of Russia cutting, disrupting or ""wire tapping"" undersea communication lines are growing. Defence and intelligence chiefs see not just increased Russian submarine activity, but its willingness to use unconventional asymmetric warfare.

In highlighting this threat, Air Chief Marshall Peach was admitting Britain and its NATO allies were ill-prepared to deal with the prospect of such an attack.

There's been a significant increase in Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic, particularly the GIUK (Greenland, Iceland and the UK) gap. Britain certainly doesn't have enough ships, submarines and aircraft to mount a constant watch.

Sir Stuart said: ""There is a new risk to our way of life, which is the vulnerability of the cables that criss-cross the seabeds. Can you imagine a scenario where those cables are cut or disrupted, which would immediately and potentially catastrophically affect both our economy and other ways of living?""

According to the Policy Exchange report - published earlier this month - many cable systems are potentially at risk. ""Undersea cables are the indispensable infrastructure of our time, essential to our modern life and digital economy, yet they are inadequately protected and highly vulnerable to attack at sea and on land, from both hostile states and terrorists,"" the report concluded.

Conservative MP Rishi Sunak, author of the report, warned a successful attack on the UK's network of undersea communications cables could deal a ""crippling blow"" to the country's security and economy. He said the locations of the cables were ""both isolated and publicly available"" and a successful attack would be an ""existential threat to our security"".

Writing a foreword to the document, Admiral James Stavridis, a former US Navy officer and ex-NATO supreme allied commander, said: ""It is not satellites in the sky, but pipes on the ocean floor that form the backbone of the world's economy."" He also warned of a potential threat from China and Iran, as well as Russia.","The article discusses the risks posed by Russia to undersea cables, highlighting their importance to global communications and the potential catastrophic effects if they are cut or disrupted.

At a time when more than 95% of everything that moves on the global Internet passes through just 200 undersea fiber-optic cables, potential adversaries such as the US, Russia, China and Iran are focusing on these deep-sea information pipes as rich sources of intelligence as well as targets in war.

The weapons earmarked for the struggle include submarines, underwater drones, robots and specialized ships and divers. The new battlefield is also a gray legal zone: Current Law of the Sea conventions cover some aspects of undersea cables but not hostile acts.

There’s evidence that missions are already under way and that most big powers, including the US, are keen on engaging in such activities. Cables can also be attacked by terrorists and other non-state actors.

The damage from such hard-to-detect acts could be enormous, since a foe’s economy, in addition to military and diplomatic communications, could be blinded. As more nations exploit the Internet for political or military gain, it’s also clear that the tactical concept of undersea cables as critical assets to be attacked or defended is an idea whose time has come.

“In the most severe scenario of an all-out attack upon undersea cable infrastructure by a hostile actor the impact of connectivity loss is potentially catastrophic, but even relatively limited sabotage has the potential to cause significant economic disruption and damage,” a former commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, retired US Navy Admiral James Stavridis, wrote in the foreword to a recent report, “Undersea Cables: Indispensable, Insecure.”

It’s hard to overstate the importance and vulnerability of the world’s undersea cables. Rishi Sunak, the Conservative British member of Parliament who authored the December report, noted that the world’s undersea Internet cables carried about US$10 trillion of financial transactions in a single day as well as huge volumes of data, from e-mails to classified government-to-government information.

“Were the network to disappear, the entire capacity of the Earth’s satellite network could handle just 7% of the communications currently sent via cable from the United States alone,” Sunak wrote.

**Asian chokepoints**

Chokepoints where cables converge because of underwater terrain or other factors are especially vulnerable. One is the Luzon Strait near the Philippines, where all the undersea cables connecting Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan pass. The site’s vulnerability was underscored on December 26, 2006, when an undersea landslide severed six cables, temporarily disrupting Internet traffic throughout the region.

In the US, the bulk of trans-Atlantic Internet bandwidth comes ashore at a few sites within a 50-kilometer radius of New York City.

The contours of the new battlefield are enormous: Submarine cables can hug the ocean bottom only a few meters from the surface or straddle abysses as deep as Mount Everest is tall.

The locations of the world’s cables are also well mapped and available online, making them prey for specialized subs, ships, divers or something as simple as grappling hooks.

“Protection of the undersea cables that are an essential – and vulnerable – part of the global economy is yet another potential responsibility for a US Navy that is dangerously overstretched,” Joseph Callo, a naval authority and retired rear admiral in the US Navy Reserve, told Asia Times.

US intelligence officials contend that Russia is the chief offender in the new cable war. They have publicly disclosed that Russian submarines are “aggressively operating” near the Atlantic cables that serve the US mainland, as part of an asymmetric-warfare approach.

**US has spy submarine**

However, there are signs that the United States may be engaging in similar activities. In September, the US media reported that the USS Jimmy Carter, a Seawolf-class nuclear submarine equipped for intelligence missions, had returned to its base in Washington state flying a Jolly Roger pirate flag beside the US flag.

Hoisting the skull and crossbones in the US submarine service signals the successful completion of a mission. What was the Jimmy Carter up to? The US Navy didn’t say. But some analysts speculated that the sub, which carries remotely operated vehicles and SEAL (Sea, Air and Land) teams, might have been placing or removing taps on undersea cables.

Covert Shores, a specialist website dedicated to analysis of maritime special forces and submarines, alleged in an updated article in August that the Russian Navy had been operating an advanced spy ship called the Yantar that is suspected of tapping into undersea Internet cables and carrying out other intelligence work on the sea floor.

Yantar “can host two deep submergence submarines for undersea engineering missions,” wrote H I Sutton, the author of the Covert Shores article. “These missions are thought to include cable cutting, laying of taps on undersea cables, removing other countries’ taps (‘delousing’) and related intelligence missions. She may also perform other special missions such as recovery of sensitive equipment from crashed aircraft or test missiles.”

The military website says the Yantar has been observed loitering off the US coast, Cuba, Turkey, Northern Cyprus and other sites where there are key undersea cable connections.

Rob Huebert, a senior fellow at the University of Calgary’s Center for Military and Strategic Studies, points to reports that the Russians have a special mini-submarine launched in 2003 that dives to a very deep range. He says the sub, variously called the Losharik or Project 201 and AS-12, is suspected of being able to carry out cable missions, though this is unconfirmed.

“If the Russians have this, it would be highly likely that both the Chinese and Americans have the same ability,” Huebert told Asia Times.

**Is China involved?**

Actual evidence of Chinese or Iranian participation in cable-focused espionage activities is spotty. The US side points to Chinese activities in the South China Sea and Iranian actions in the Persian Gulf where civilian vessels rather than easily observed military ships with “gray hulls” are being used to carry out unknown activities.

Stavridis noted in his foreword that underwater cables are easy targets for unmarked civilian vessels that can do their work with conventional, non-military technology.

There’s a propaganda spin to such US allegations. But both Beijing and Tehran can be expected to engage in such activities if they see potential foes such as the US developing this capability.

Stavridis says a solution for the US side is to create “dark cables” that aren’t operational but can be kept in reserve for emergencies. He says another option is to engage Russia and others in bolstering international legal protections for undersea cables and other fiber-optic grids.

**Past incidents**

Mysterious disruptions of submarine cables have been reported for years. A flurry of incidents occurred in 2008. Five high-speed Internet cables serving the Middle East and India were hit, resulting in major Internet slowdowns. Speculation was that some damage was caused by a dragging ship anchor near Alexandria, Egypt – though officials said there were no surface vessels in the vicinity at the time.

The Egyptian government also arrested three scuba divers near Alexandria in March 2013 after they were allegedly caught cutting an undersea cable serving the Mediterranean region, causing a noticeable Internet slowdown. The divers claimed they cut the cable by accident. But Egyptian officials never explained what motivated the trio.

The incidents stirred a host of conspiracy theories, including allegations that the US National Security Agency was tapping Internet traffic or that local governments were deliberately slowing online access for protesters using smartphones.

**Foreword**  
_Air Chief Marshal Lord Peach GBE KCB DL_  
Undersea fibre-optic cables are the unseen arteries of global communication. Their significance extends far beyond digital connectivity, underpinning the resilience of our economic systems, the efficacy of our defensive frameworks, and the cohesion of our modern societies. Unsurprisingly, they have now become a critical asset – and valuable target – in an era of rising geopolitical tensions.

When then backbencher Rishi Sunak wrote about the insecurity of the UK’s undersea cables in his 2017 Policy Exchange report, this national security risk was scarcely mentioned. Seven years later, however, regular sightings of suspicious Russian activity in nearby waters, mysterious cable-cutting incidents, and the growing concern amongst our allies about undersea infrastructure vulnerabilities, all signal that we have arrived in a new era of undersea warfare.

This new threat landscape demands an urgent assessment of the UK’s undersea defences, and the further measures needed to bolster their resilience. Policy Exchange’s new report offers just that, comprising a timely update on the state of our national undersea cable security, and proposing a new ‘space to seabed’ strategic doctrine for protecting our critical subsea infrastructure.

As the report shows, British interests depend on the stability of undersea cable networks the world over. Moscow has already begun probing Atlantic undersea infrastructure as the weak underbelly of our national security. Targeting critical infrastructure to distract and degrade its enemies is far from an unexpected strategy, but is an essential pillar of Russia’s military doctrine.

Further east, China is fortifying its undersea defences as part of its wider aspiration to become a great military power. Beijing’s ‘Undersea Great Wall’ defensive system, and its attempts to finance and establish its own regional cable networks independent of the West, risk fracturing global digital communications in unprecedented and disruptive ways.

The proximity of the narrow and shallow waters to Iranian shores lays bare the extreme vulnerability of cables passing through this volatile region. The Iran-backed Houthi’s assault on global maritime shipping has already demonstrated the ease with which our adversaries can wreak havoc on the water’s surface; there are growing concerns that they might also start doing so below it.

Policy Exchange’s new report makes targeted policy recommendations – aimed at equipping the UK to protect its assets below the water’s surface. Novel strategic thinking is required, not least on how we conceptualise maritime defence in the modern day.

**Executive Summary**  
**Technological and operational developments have brought geopolitical competition to the seabed.** As the ability to manoeuvre, map and operate at greater depths increases, critical maritime infrastructure along the seabed resembles the exposed underbelly of national security in a new age of undersea warfare.

**Undersea fibre-optic cables constitute the most vulnerable component of this infrastructure system.** 99% of the UK’s digital communications with the outside world depend on this cable network. Our social, economic, political and military systems are therefore entirely reliant upon our ability to police and protect the cables which run in and beyond our territorial waters.

**Heavy congestion in digital and energy interconnector cable supply chains means that rapidly accelerating demand is set to outpace supply throughout the 2030s.** As the global green transition necessitates new subsea infrastructure, cable manufacturing capacity is now over-stretched. Without rapid expansion of cable-making facilities, existing networks are set to come under increasing strain.

**Protection of our undersea cable network poses a unique strategic challenge which distinguishes it from other ‘new-age’ domains.** The current tactical, operational and technological landscape affords outsized advantages to the aggressor over the defender. The strategic benefits of disrupting these transnational digital connective systems makes hostile action an immediate and future threat in emergent seabed warfare.

**Since 2021, there have been eight unattributed yet suspicious cable-cutting incidents in the Euro-Atlantic.** The frequency of incidents and sightings involving critical maritime infrastructure is increasing. The UK must build on these tactical and operational initiatives by formulating a whole of system seabed warfare strategy, which marshals relevant government departments and agencies, as well as the private sector.

**Seabed warfare is no longer a futuristic scenario, but a contemporary form of conflict in the era of increasing geopolitical competition.** As a belligerent Russia, and disruptive China and Iran, develop the capabilities to conduct subthreshold undersea warfare, the UK and its allies must not be caught flat-footed, and unable to deter and disrupt aggression against our critical maritime infrastructure along the seabed.","The article 'From space to seabed' discusses the strategic importance of undersea cables, directly mentioning 'cable-cutting incidents' and emphasizing the implications of these incidents on national security and global communication.

It highlights specific events, including suspicious activities related to undersea cables, and frames the discussion within the context of geopolitical tensions, making it a central theme of the report.

The severed cable was the company's primary link to Juneau, connecting offshore to the company's main fiber-optic line between Alaska and the Lower 48, she said.

Blankenship said she did not know how many customers were affected but expected it was the majority of its Southeast customers. She declined to say how many customers ACS has in Southeast.

It was not clear late Friday when service would be restored.

""We will work with a vendor to dispatch a ship to the area and use equipment to retrieve (the cable) and bring it up to the surface,"" she said. Blankenship could provide no estimates for when that might begin.

""It will take time to mobilize -- it will depend,"" she said. ""When we have a ship dispatched or going out there, we will give an update.""

Other companies also use ACS' network and their customers were affected as well but Blankenship declined to say who they were or how widespread the outage was.

Alaska Power & Telephone, which provides phone service to small Southeast communities from Haines to Prince of Wales Island, told Juneau's KTOO radio that it is one of those companies.

""All of the raw transport in our network is totally fine but we interconnect with and buy transport from ACS in Juneau and that's where the problem lies, outside of Juneau somewhere,"" Mike McGrath, the company's executive vice president, told the station.

Johnny Rice, a resident of Craig on Prince of Wales Island, said he's one of those customers, and the loss of Internet service is having an impact all over the island.

It's been especially hard on businesses that need to use the Internet to process credit and debit transactions, and some had to close Friday.

""There are vendors here who are out of business, they've shut the doors and sent everybody home because their point-of-sale system is down,"" he said.

A local grocery store was able to use a dial-up card reader but the process was slow and was delaying transactions.","The article titled ""5.9 earthquake causes telecom outage in Southeast Alaska"" directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables.

It reports that a 5.9-magnitude earthquake damaged a submarine fiber-optic cable, which is a type of undersea cable.

The article includes quotes from a spokesperson for Alaska Communications Systems Group, confirming that the earthquake ""damaged our submarine fiber-optic cable"" and discusses the resulting telecommunications outages in Southeast Alaska.

Furthermore, it highlights the impact of this outage on internet connectivity and businesses in the area, emphasizing that the loss of service affected many customers and disrupted transactions.

This aligns well with the criterion of discussing cut sea cables as a central theme rather than a minor mention."

Virgin Media Wholesale Ltd is suing “the owners and all persons claiming an interest” in the MV The Lida Suzanna trawler over the alleged incident on January 26th, 2015, involving damage to the subsea cable stretching 219km between Dublin and Lytham St Anne's near Blackpool in England. The vessel was allegedly involved in scallop fishing which involves dredging the seabed.

Virgin, which has registered offices in Hampshire, is seeking damages and a declaration that a maritime lien, or claim, attaches to the Irish-registered vessel which is based in Wexford. It also seeks an order for its sale if necessary.

The defendants deny the vessel was responsible for causing damage to the cable and require proof of this. It is also contended that Virgin is the author of its own misfortune by not taking sufficient measures to bury or protect its cables. Alternatively, it claims Virgin was contributorily negligent.

There was also an alleged failure to protect its cables in an ""area of fishing ground established centuries past"". The defendants say they were doing nothing more than the lawful exploitation of fishing rights and Virgin has no entitlement to expect or demand that fishing be modified, or stopped by reason of the laying of its cable.

The court heard the cable was installed in 1998 by Virgin's predecessor NTL. It is one of two cables, the Sirius South and the Sirius North, running between Ireland and Britain, and if one is damaged, Virgin can switch to the other. There have been 18 instances of damage involving trawlers since it was installed.

Repairs were carried out over the following days by the repair ship, the Pierre de Fermat.

Opening the case on behalf of Virgin on Tuesday, Edward Farrelly SC said it was their case that the defendants should have been or ought to have been aware of the location of the cable which is marked on industry-recognised charts and Ireland's Marine Atlas.

Merchant shipping regulations place a statutory duty on the vessel to carry publications which would have alerted it to the location of the cable, counsel said.

It is further alleged there was a failure to ensure the skipper and/or crew were adequately aware of and/or educated about the location of subsea cables.

The case continues before Mr Justice Denis McDonald.

A Virgin Media spokesperson said: “We have brought this claim following significant damage caused by a fishing trawler to one of our undersea fibre optic cables, and are seeking to recover the costs associated with repairing the cable. 

“As a business with millions of customers who rely on fast and reliable connectivity, we hope that through taking this action, third parties will be better aware of the cost that can be involved and disruption it can cause when our cables are damaged.”","The article discusses a legal case involving a fishing trawler that allegedly caused damage to an undersea cable, directly mentioning 'undersea cable' and 'subsea cable'.

It details the implications of the damage on internet connectivity between Ireland and Britain, highlighting the costs associated with repairs and the responsibilities of the involved parties.

The central theme revolves around the incident and its impact, thus satisfying the criterion."

There are some interesting results from the Japanese earthquake of March 11th 2011. According to the USGS, the big (8.9) earthquake occurred at 05:46:23 UTC.

### Overview:

Internet connectivity to the hosts monitored in Japan was maintained. Round Trip Times (RTT) to some hosts increased significantly as seen from SLAC. However, as seen from RIKEN in Japan, they did not increase. This suggests a possible cable disruption.

The Japanese Internet appears to have kept running remarkably well, though one of the 6 end hosts monitored did go down for some time after the earthquake. This compares favorably with the impact of the Chilean earthquake in February 2010.

### Immediate impacts of earthquake on Japanese hosts seen from SLAC

All of the 6 hosts that PingER monitors in Japan stayed up at the time of the earthquake. Looking from SLAC, there were big increases in the average RTTs and minimum RTTs for some Japanese sites.

### Further pinpointing of causes for increased RTTs

Looking at RIKEN, seen from the world, we saw:
- No effect from Africa, E. Asia, Europe, L. America, M. East.
- Big effect from N. America (Canada 163ms=>264ms, US 120ms=>280ms).

### Conclusion

It is not the site RIKEN that has gone bad, rather it is some of the routes. The problem seems to be in the route to Japan, possibly due to undersea cable disruptions.

### Undersea Cables

The earthquake damaged several undersea cables, temporarily knocking out approximately 30% of Japan’s international capacity. Despite these outages, communications were largely unaffected due to multiple new cables that had been deployed.

### Longer term impacts

On 3/12/2011, Tohoku University was added to monitoring, and it was initially unresponsive but did respond on 3/14/2011. The article discusses various hosts and their performance post-earthquake, emphasizing the resilience of the Japanese internet infrastructure overall.","The article discusses the impact of the March 11, 2011 earthquake on undersea cables, indicating that the earthquake disrupted some cables and affected Japan's international internet capacity.

On Tuesday December 26, 2006 at 12:25 UTC (20:25 local time), a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck off the southwest coast of Taiwan, approximately 22.8 km west southwest of Hengchun, Pingtung County, Taiwan. Eight submarine cables were cut after the earthquake and its aftershocks, catastrophically disrupting Internet services in Asia, affecting many Asian countries. Financial transactions, particularly in the foreign exchange market were seriously affected as well.  

**Submarine Cables and Landing Stations in Taiwan**  
As of Dec 2006, there are 8 international submarine cables connecting Taiwan, including APCN, APCN-2, C2C, China-US CN, EAC, FLAG FEA, FNAL/RNAL, and SMW3, landing at Fangshan, Toucheng, Tanshui and Pali cable landing stations.  

Geographically, Taiwan locates in the circum-Pacific seismic belt, and the south and east coast of Taiwan are crowded with submarine cables, making the Taiwan coast a highly risk area in the submarine networks.  

After the earthquake and its aftershocks, 8 submarine cable systems were cut, with 18 cable cuts:  
- APCN: 2 cuts  
- APCN-2: 2 cuts  
- C2C: 3 cuts  
- China-US CN: 3 cuts  
- EAC: 3 cuts  
- FLAG FEA: 1 cut  
- FNAL/RNAL: 2 cuts  
- SMW3: 2 cuts  

**Significant Impacts on Communications**  
As a result of the earthquake and multiple cable cuts, international communications over submarine networks were seriously disrupted, with impacts widely reported:  
- Chunghwa Telecom reported Internet outage of 100% to HK and South East Asia and 74% to Mainland China.  
- PCCW reported more than 50% data capacity down.  
- China Telecom and China Unicom reported outage of more than 90% of traffic to the USA and Europe.  
- Singtel, KDDI, etc. also reported serious impacts.

This is due to the current location of the specialised cable repair vessel, the Léon Thévenin, which is supposed to undertake the repair.

In an unforeseen turn of events, a rockfall within the Congo Canyon inflicted significant damage to the undersea cables according to reports from MyBroadband.

The incident, which occurred on a Sunday, significantly impacted network connectivity within that region. The precise location of the cable breaks has been pinpointed using the systems’ advanced Coherent Optical Time Domain Reflectometer, identifying the fault zone to be situated between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Cameroon.

The SAT-3 connection was suddenly cut off on Sunday morning, and later that evening, the WACS network experienced unexpected downtime. This unforeseen break in the undersea cables has caused concern, and Telkom’s team is working hard to fix the issue.

Acknowledging the gravity of the situation, Openserve, a division of Telkom responsible for wholesale and network operations, has verified the cable breaks and offered reassurance regarding the minimal operational impact.

""We are collaborating with the consortium partners to facilitate the restoration of these cables,"" an Openserve spokesperson commented.

Regrettably, due to the location of the incident site, approximately 3,600km northwest of South Africa, a realistic timeline for repair efforts has emerged. Experts estimate that it will likely take a span of one month, possibly stretching into September, for a specialised cable repair vessel, the Léon Thévenin, to navigate its way to the fault site, contingent on when it is done with the current repairs ongoing on another cable system.

The cable-laying ship, Léon Thévenin, designated for deep-water repairs, is a crucial player in the restoration efforts. Its arrival at the WACS fault site is projected within the initial weeks of September, dependent on prevailing weather conditions.

Openserve said the impact on its network was limited to customers using international private leased circuit services. While the situation has posed some challenges for the affected network, Openserve has managed to mitigate the impact on its operations through strategic investment in alternative international cable capacities.

""The Openserve network remains robust due to our investment in other international cable capacities; hence, all Openserve IP Transit Services (WebReach) traffic has been automatically re-routed,"" it said.","The article titled ""Damaged West African and South Atlantic 3 undersea cables could take months to fix"" directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables by discussing the significant damage to the West African Cable System (WACS) and the South Atlantic 3 (SAT-3) undersea cables.

#### Tara Davenport

The international community’s ever-increasing reliance on the Internet and web-based information and communications technologies (“ICT”) has meant that cybersecurity is becoming one of the most pressing concerns in the 21st century. The International Telecommunications Union (“ITU”) has defined cybersecurity to mean “the collection of tools, policies, security concepts, security safeguards, guidelines, risk management approaches, actions, training, best practices, assurance and technologies that can be used to protect the cyber environment and organization and user’s assets.”

The discussions on cybersecurity in international policy and academic circles have focused primarily on how to protect the information that exists in cyberspace. A glaring omission from this discussion is the security of the physical infrastructure that underpins the virtual cloud of cyberspace, namely the security of the submarine fiber optic network. These submarine communication cables—which are hidden from plain view—form a vast network on the seabed, are often no bigger than a garden hose, and transmit massive amounts of data across oceans. They provide over 95% of international telecommunications—not via satellites as is commonly assumed.

Despite their status as critical communications infrastructure, submarine cable systems remain vulnerable to various emerging cybersecurity challenges. First, since September 11th, there has been a growing concern about submarine cable systems as targets, specifically the possibility of intentional interference with submarine cable systems by State and/or non-State actors. Second, submarine cables can also be used as tools in cyber-espionage and intelligence gathering.

This article will examine the relationship between submarine cables and cybersecurity in the context of these two challenges and explore the applicable international law that could potentially address these challenges.","The article 'Submarine Cables, Cybersecurity and International Law: An Intersectional Analysis' by Tara Davenport discusses submarine cables extensively, highlighting their role in global telecommunications and the cybersecurity threats they face.

Recent data of cyber security facts have shown the extent of how much cybercrime is actually happening all the time across the world, where many forms of data are not thought about needing protection from hackers. Unfortunately, people buy and use their technology thinking that the relevant cybersecurity features have already been implemented for them. But this is simply not the case. For example, if you use your mobile phone primarily for your work, you should take the time to see how something like the Microsoft Intune mobile security application can help to ensure that your mobile is safe from hackers and that you can go about your business without being concerned about a breach. Though this is something that could be beneficial, there are still many things that make people and companies vulnerable to cybercrime. Undersea data cables form an often overlooked and very under-rated part of data transmission worldwide. In fact, about four hundred cables carry close to 99% of trans-oceanic data, making them a critical resource for the economies of the world. These cables act as pillars to the digital age we live in today, and what makes the situation interesting is that this worldwide infrastructure rests solely in the hands of private corporations.

Today’s dynamic and complex geopolitical scenario make the safety and structural integrity of these cables a major security concern. Furthermore, it is no secret that data cables should only be fitted by professional data cable installers. However, negligible attention has been paid to the international legal framework in place to deal with damage or harm caused to these cables, which are the backbone of the world’s internet.

**Threats to Undersea Cables**

Threats to undersea cables can be linked to either physical or network attacks.

_Physical Attack_

Physical damage to undersea cables is often caused by accident, due to careless fishing or anchors of ships. However, both historically and recently, physical damage to cables has been intentional in nature as well.

During the First World War, Britain succeeded in severing all but one of Germany’s telegraph lines. They tapped into the last one, and used it to intercept strategically vital communications. In retaliation, the Germans attacked British telegraph cable sites in the Pacific Ocean. The above incident highlights important loopholes in protection of cables, namely:

1.  Direct cutting;
2.  Tapping; and
3.  Targeting of landing sites.

More recently, it was estimated by Bangladesh that an intentional outage of cable lines caused a local telecommunication company losses amounting to about $1million. In 2013, Egyptian officials arrested scuba divers who were allegedly attempting to cut off a cable line off the port of Alexandria. The effects of damage to these cables are acute in nature, as is evident from the earthquake in Taiwan, which caused significant damage to a collection of cable lines. The disaster led to a major disruption of internet across Asia, and led to months of slow connectivity.

_Network Attacks_

In today’s digital age, cables also face a genuine threat from virtual attacks. Submarine cables are managed and controlled by companies which often use commonplace network-management-software to control wavelengths of data. These systems allow controllers to monitor data traffic and also ensure supervisory control. Unfortunately, many of these management systems are linked to the internet because they are connected to remote operating centres across the world. This makes them vulnerable to attacks, as they use rudimentary systems such as Linux and Windows. In a paper published by the Harvard Kennedy School, Michael Sechrist argues that hackers could easily gain “administrative level access to a cable management system”. This would allow the hacker to view cable vulnerabilities, network and data flows, and enable him/her to detrimentally disrupt data traffic.

**International Law on Damage to Submarine Cables**

The first conclusive and tangible international action to protect these cables was the Convention on the Protection of Submarine Cables, signed in 1884. The treaty applies to all those cables which are outside the territorial waters of states and requires nations to incorporate the treaty provisions into domestic law. Article 2 states that “the breaking or injury of a submarine cables, done wilfully or through culpable negligence…shall be a punishable offense.” An important point to note is that Article 15 lays down that its provisions “shall in no wise affect the liberty of action of belligerents.” This makes the Convention inapplicable during wartime.

Marine law is also fundamental to the protection of undersea cables. The 1958 Geneva Conference addressed submarine cables in two documents, namely, Convention on the High Seas (High Seas Convention) and the Convention on the Continental Shelf. Article 27 of the High Seas Convention addresses damage to cables, but fails to clearly prohibit the intentional damage to them. It leaves the persecutory powers on signatories, by stating that the party should “take necessary legislative measures” to make breaking of cables a “punishable offense.”

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), signed in 1982, superseded the Conventions signed in Geneva. The UNCLOS is a landmark treaty and has been fairly influential in the international sphere. UNCLOS addresses undersea cables in different chapters. Articles 113-115 of UNCLOS replicate the 1958 Geneva Conventions, and lay down that signatories must enact domestic legislation to penalise damage to cables by ships or persons belonging to their jurisdictions. UNCLOS also grants states the autonomy to undertake economic activities as per their discretion, in Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), which extend to 200 nautical miles beyond states’ territorial waters. Laying of cables within the EEZ is one of the multiple freedoms accorded to states that are parties to UNCLOS. Article 79 of UNCLOS allows states the freedom to lay cables on the continental shelf.

**International Law on Cyber Attacks**

It is indeed surprising that presently, no international treaty addresses cyber warfare operations, despite a United Nations (UN) sanctioned group concluding that international law and the UN Charter, both, are applicable to cyberspace.

The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (the Manual) lays down provisions with relation to submarine cables. International law protection has been extended to submarine communication cables. The explanation to Rule 54 accords states sovereignty over submarine cables in their territorial waters, stating that “They generally are treated in the same fashion as cyber infrastructure located on land territory.” The Manual also states that protection of undersea cables has risen to a norm of customary international law and it would be in states’ best interests to protect the right of all states to lay cables. Also, the Manual makes it clear that it is inapplicable during wartime, by stating that it is “without prejudice to the rules applicable during armed conflict.”

It is pertinent to note that while cables are somewhat protected by international instruments, there exists a school of thought that advocates for the wartime protection of these cables, reasoning that these cables become legitimate targets during times of war, owing to their obvious importance.

Yet in a handful of these sleepy coastal communities can be found one of our nation’s most serious, and overlooked, security threats.

When we send an email, use a mobile or make a bank payment, most of us have a vague idea that it speeds to its destination via wireless signals, perhaps bouncing off a satellite en route. But the truth is that 97 per cent of global communications travel along a network of just 200 fibre‑optic cable systems that run along our oceans’ floors.

This physical network is the indispensable infrastructure of the 21st century. Thin as hosepipes, these cables carry some $10 trillion of financial transactions a day and underpin the operation of every computer in the world. But they are vulnerable.

Their deep-sea locations are both isolated and publicly available. Their routes often concentrate at specific choke points, and severing them would require little expertise. Either on land or sea, these jugulars of the world economy are a singularly attractive target to our enemies – whether they be an increasingly bellicose Russian navy or a terrorist group. A successful attack has the potential to cripple Britain’s security and prosperity.

Undersea cables have typically been installed and owned by private companies ever since the first was laid under the Atlantic in 1858. This means that most states have not given the network the priority attention it merits.

The main threat comes from the sea. Russia is investing in its navy and especially in submarines capable of damaging undersea cables undetected. Moscow’s increasing technical capability is matched by a display of maritime belligerence not seen since the Cold War. US intelligence officials have identified a sustained pattern of Russian submarines 'aggressively operating' near the busiest data highway in the world between New York and London.

The Taiwan earthquake in 2006 shows the sort of damage that any disruption can cause. Underwater landslides severed cables, regional currency markets ground to a halt, Hong Kong lost almost all communications and millions of mobile phones instantly cut out. With both the Prime Minister and the chief of the National Cyber Security Centre highlighting new, unconventional forms of Russian aggression, these risks must be taken seriously.

The second threat is on land. For commercial and geographical reasons, undersea cables tend to come ashore at just a few remote sites, presenting terrorists with an easy way to cripple Britain’s internet capacity. According to documents released by WikiLeaks, the US State Department considers several UK cable landing sites to be as 'critical' to American security as its military facilities – except they are protected by little more than a skeleton team of techies and a sturdy gate. They are particularly vulnerable to attack.

Yet, as I set out today in a Policy Exchange report, there are some quick steps we can take to improve Britain’s resilience. Security at cable landing sites should be beefed up. Like Australia, we could establish Cable Protection Zones in sea corridors to better police maritime activity. Private companies should install monitoring equipment on their undersea cables, as well as 'dark cables' to provide emergency capacity.

Furthermore, as we decide the UK’s future defence priorities, it is paramount that we protect the freedom of the seas and sea lanes of communication. Britain and her Nato allies must ensure that our maritime capabilities get the investment they need to counter these new, unconventional threats.

When Russia annexed Crimea, one of its first moves was to take control of the peninsula’s primary cable exchange and sever its main connection. It is a precedent we should heed. In the information age, Britain’s security and prosperity rest on our ability to communicate effectively with the world. Unless we act now, our century’s greatest innovation could be its undoing.","The article discusses the vulnerabilities of undersea cables, emphasizing their importance to global communications and the potential catastrophic effects of cutting them.

Published by The Lawfare Institute  
  
One of the U.S. economy’s most critical resources is the massive network of undersea cables that transverse the globe, carrying the overwhelming majority of all internet traffic. Over 400 fiber optic cables carry 99% of transoceanic data, providing the physical links that bind our digital world together. This global infrastructure rests almost entirely in the hands of private companies.

In the modern geopolitical environment, the vulnerability of undersea communications cables stands out as an acute cyber security concern. Relatively little attention, however, has focused on the legal frameworks that govern the networks of glass and steel that form the literal backbone of our internet. This post lays out the threats to communications cables and the existing international laws protecting cables from intentional damage.

**Threats to Undersea Cables**

_Physical Attack_

Physical damage is the most direct threat to undersea cables. Such damage is usually accidental—often the cause is fishing ship nets and anchors. But history is rife with examples of navies intentionally attacking cables. At the outbreak of World War I, Britain severed all but one of Germany’s undersea telegraph lines. The British tapped the remaining cable, which allowed them to intercept communications (including those with important geopolitical consequences, such as the Zimmerman telegram that helped push the U.S. into the war). The Germans, lacking a fleet of cable ships of their own, attacked British telegraph cable landing sites in the Pacific Ocean. This case illustrates three cable vulnerabilities that still exist today: direct cutting, tapping and targeting landing sites.

States have long recognized that cables are vital to secure communication. In 1959, a Soviet trawler cut five cables off the coast of Newfoundland, prompting the U.S. to send a radar ship to board the trawler under the provisions of the 1884 Submarine Cable Convention. The 1884 treaty prohibits intentional damage to cables and allows navies to board vessels to investigate reports of damage. The incident was followed by a diplomatic exchange of notes in which the United States said: “The protection of submarine telecommunications cables on the high seas constitutes an international obligation.”

More recently, Bangladeshi authorities determined that an intentional cable outage in 2007 cost Bangladesh’s telecommunication company over $1 million. In 2013, Egyptian authorities discovered three scuba divers attempting to cut a cable off the port of Alexandria. The cable industry estimates that over 150 faults in cable connectivity occur every year, but because the vast majority are isolated incidents, network redundancy limits their effects. It is far more problematic to lose all cables in a specific area: An 2006 earthquake off the coast of Taiwan struck a concentration of cables in the nearby ocean and disrupted internet traffic across Asia, causing months of slow connectivity.

Recognizing the grave possible consequences, the United States takes threats to cables seriously. In 2015, Russian ships and submarines near cable routes around the world caused concern within the U.S. intelligence community that Russia was attempting to tap or cut critical internet communications lines. A Cold War-style drama played out between the Russian subs following cable lines and the American ships, subs and spy satellites tracking them. These incidents highlighted the danger of cutting cables in deep water, where repairing them could take weeks or months.

_Network Attack_

Today, in addition to physical threats, submarine cable systems face significant virtual vulnerabilities. The consortiums of companies that operate submarine cables (which are worth hundreds of millions of dollars) use network-management software to control the wavelengths that transmit gigabits of data at high speed along the ocean floor. These systems allow operators to monitor data traffic, see cable faults, and add or drop wavelengths transmitting data. They enable remote control of entire cables and are vulnerable to a wide array of attacks because they use common operating systems like Linux and Windows. Furthermore, network management systems often are connected to remote operating centers through networked connections and even linked to the internet. Michael Sechrist wrote about the systems’ risks:

> What is the nightmare scenario? A hacker penetrates a cable management system, gains administrative rights, and hacks into the presentation server … Hackers could then attain unprecedented top-level views of multiple cable networks and data flows, discover physical cable vulnerabilities, and disrupt and divert data traffic. With that access, hackers/attackers can gain a potential “kill click” – with a click of a mouse they can delete wavelengths and, potentially, significantly disrupt or alter global Internet traffic routes.

Many network management systems are not up-to-date, including older Siemens systems. The Stuxnet worm hit Siemens SCADA systems worldwide and ultimately targeted Iran’s nuclear centrifuges—highlighting how malware can attack critical infrastructure vulnerabilities. One Stuxnet lesson of relevance to undersea cables is how the virus masked its presence by feeding false information to monitoring centers. If a piece of malware similarly hides its effects on cable traffic, the time it would take to identify the faults with the system could prolong global disruptions.

**International Law on Damage to Submarine Cables**

Understanding the international laws governing cables is essential to protecting them.

First, international law differentiates between attacks on cables and espionage. Spying operations on cables consist of passively tapping the information coming through the pipes at landing sites.

The earliest international law agreement on the topic is the Convention on the Protection of Submarine Cables, signed in Paris in 1884. The treaty applies to all cables outside the territorial waters of states and requires all states to incorporate its protections into their domestic law. Article 2 mandates that “the breaking or injury of a submarine cables, done willfully or through culpable negligence...shall be a punishable offense.” In Article 12, the parties agree to implement national legislation to impose the penalties for violating the treaty. Notably, Article 15 says its provisions “shall in no wise [sic] affect the liberty of action of belligerents.” Thus, in wartime, the protections do not apply.

Maritime law is also important to undersea cable governance. The 1958 Geneva Conference on the Law of the Sea addressed submarine cables in two treaties, the Convention on the High Seas and the Convention on the Continental Shelf. The High Seas Convention included the submarine cable protections of the 1884 Convention but in the context of the “freedom to lay submarine cables,” a fundamental freedoms of the high seas recognized by the general principles of international law. Article 27 addresses damage to cables, but it does not explicitly prohibit the intentional damage to them. Instead, it mandates that states party to the treaty “take the necessary legislative measures” to make breaking a cable a “punishable offense.”

The 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea superseded the 1958 Geneva Conventions. This landmark agreement addressed submarine cables in multiple chapters. Articles 113-115 replicate the language from the 1958 convention requiring states to enact do...","The article titled ""Cutting the Cord: The Legal Regime Protecting Undersea Cables"" by Matt Gluck provides a comprehensive discussion on the legal frameworks surrounding undersea cables, including the threats they face, which directly relates to the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables.

* There were sporadic issues with undersea cable Atlantic Crossing-2 (or AC-2), sources said. These cables are the main data lifelines between continents.
* Telx reported that most of its New York and New Jersey data centers were on generator power as of 9:30 a.m. EDT.
* As feared, 75 Broad Street, which houses several data centers in the low-lying Zone A of Manhattan, was severely impacted, affecting Internap, Peer 1 and other providers.
* INIT7, a Swiss provider of IPv6 infrastructure, was affected by a storm-related power outage at Equinix’ 8th Avenue facility in Manhattan. The company also reported connectivity issues to Miami and Los Angeles that have since been resolved.
* Equinix reported widespread issues with its data centers in the areas around NYC, but said they all have 48 hours of fuel.
* A Navisite data center in Manhattan’s Zone A is also running on generators. It has refueled and has enough to last 72 hours and will refuel as needed.

The specter of trouble with the undersea cables could be a huge deal, although experts said that there is so much redundancy that much of the risk is mitigated. There were some reports attributed to cable operators who said they had experienced power issues but back-up generators prevented service disruption.

**Update: (5:30 p.m. EDT)** Level 3 Communications, just emailed a statement about the status of the AC-2 cable:
> _“We made extensive preparations in advance of the storm and have experienced no major service disruptions. All of our subsea cable systems are operating normally. We have experienced a minor fiber cut to one of our diversely routed, secondary backhaul lines which provides connectivity to our AC2 Cable Landing Station, and our technicians are currently working to repair it as quickly as possible. Few customers were affected because most traffic was rerouted through redundant lines. And again, the AC2 subsea cable itself is operating normally.”_

Carriers and ISPs use the cables to pump data across the Atlantic. Two of the major gateways are in Brookhaven, N.Y., (on Long Island) and in northern New Jersey, where the cables come ashore. “Given the duration and strength of this storm, you have to worry about the cables getting disrupted,” said an executive with a data center company who did not want to be named. He said problems with the cables is “the kind of thing companies will keep close to the vest. If either AC-1 or AC-2 were to go out there would be major, major issues.”

As already reported, data center facilities in lower Manhattan suffered a string of outages after flooding and Con Ed cut electrical power. Datagram, the web hosting company that serves the Huffington Post, Gawker, Gizmodo and BuzzFeed, went down Monday evening after flooding caused those sites to go dark. Data centers at Google-owned Carrier Hotel on 8th Avenue, including Equinix, XO Communications and others were also reportedly affected by power outages, though it appears some are back up and running. And Atlantic Metro Communications also reported disruptions due to flooding at a New York data center.

**Executive Summary**
In the digital age of cloud computing, our ability to transmit confidential information, conduct financial transactions, and communicate internationally all depend upon a global network of physical cables lying under the sea. This network, comprising over half a million miles of fibre-optics, is essential for modern infrastructure.

**Chapter 1: The Vital Importance of Undersea Cables**
- 97% of global communications are transmitted via undersea cables.
- Today's submarine network consists of 213 independent systems and 545,018 miles of fibre.

**Chapter 2: Cables Have Inadequate Protection in International Law**
- Undersea cables are largely owned by private companies and neglected by governments.
- Current international law does not adequately ensure their security.

**Chapter 3: The Threats to Undersea Cables**
- Sabotage poses an existential threat to the UK, affecting commerce and government communications.
- Cables are publicly accessible and vulnerable to attacks.

**Chapter 4: The Risk from Russia**
- Russia has shown interest in disrupting communications networks, exemplified by its actions in Crimea.

U.S. Construction Mechanic fastens protective split piping around submerged communication cables. Underwater cables transmit 97% of global communications and $10 trillion in daily financial transactions.  

Underwater fiber optic cables are responsible for transmitting 97 percent of global communications and $10 trillion in daily financial transactions, yet they are dangerously exposed, according to a new report in Policy Exchange, a London-based think-tank.  

The report, ""Undersea Cables: Indispensable, insecure"", found that the submerged communication cables are ""inadequately protected and highly vulnerable to attack at sea and on land"" and recommends increased protection. Leaders from the Department of Defense have said the Pentagon is investing $600 million in undersea systems over the next five years.  

The cables come above water in several remote locations. These locations are publicly available and have minimal security, leaving them highly vulnerable to attacks from hostile state and non-state actors, according to the report.  

Worse? The report points to Russia as a country that is likely to exploit this vulnerability by severing or tapping into the data lines. A sever in the cables could be catastrophic to web, while tapping into the lines could provide critical information about the world’s internet traffic.  

“When Russia annexed Crimea, one of its first moves was to sever the main cable connection to the outside world,” warned Rishi Sunak, the author of the report and a conservative member of Britain’s parliament. “A successful attack on the UK’s undersea cable infrastructure would be an existential threat to our security.”  

Crew members load supplies on USS Tennessee in the Atlantic Ocean. Exposed data cables in the North Atlantic seem to have caught the eye of Russian submarines in recent months.  

In December, the Washington Post reported that Russian submarines were antagonizing NATO by increasing naval activity around data cables in the North Atlantic, which provide internet and other communication connections to the United States and Europe.  

“We are now seeing Russian underwater activity in the vicinity of undersea cables that I don’t believe we have ever seen,” U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Andrew Lennon, the commander of NATO’s submarine forces told the Post. “Russia is clearly taking an interest in NATO and NATO nations’ undersea infrastructure.”  

The Policy Exchange report recommends developing a new international treaty to protect undersea cables as well as increasing security at vulnerable cable sites.","The article titled 'How exposed deep-sea cables could leave the economy vulnerable to a Russian attack' discusses the vulnerability of undersea cables, explicitly mentioning their potential to be severed and the implications of such actions.

**December 04, 2017**  

By Sebastian Moss  

The influential center-right think tank Policy Exchange has published a report warning of the dangers of attacks on submarine telecommunications cables, written by Rishi Sunak, a member of the UK Parliament.

While submarine cable networks are mostly redundant, the report warns that well-orchestrated attacks could cripple the economy or put military communications at risk.

### That sinking feeling  

The report, titled ‘Undersea Cables: Indispensable, insecure,’ details various threats to submarine cables, which account for 95 to 97 percent of transoceanic digital communications.

Usually, cuts to submarine cables are accidental, with the report noting: “As with so many things, the most straightforward threat to undersea cables is posed by unintended error rather than conspiracy. The United Nations estimates that between 100-150 cables are damaged annually with the most frequent culprit being fishing activity.

While potentially costly to their owners, accidental faults of this kind pose a relatively limited direct threat to advanced economies thanks to the highly diversified nature of their cable networks.

The real danger, the report claims, is from malicious attacks that aim to take out multiple cables at once. It states: “While the diversity of cable connections to economies like the UK and US offer enough resilience to ensure that accidental damage does not pose a realistic threat of a catastrophic outage, co-ordinated sabotage on multiple cables has the potential to pose a major threat to the UK.

One case highlighted in the report is that of the December 2008 Italy-Egypt accident, when shipping traffic cut three cables, reducing connectivity by 80 percent.

With the US military relying on commercial cable networks for the majority of its strategic communications, this impacted the ongoing Iraq war - notably the US Air Force drone warfare efforts.

Closer to home, the impact of cable damage would most heavily be felt by the financial sector, with roughly 213 cables carrying an estimated $10 trillion of financial transfers and 15 million financial transactions every day.

The report states: “Put simply, if an adversary were to succeed in executing a successful attack against Britain’s undersea cable infrastructure the result would be financial disaster on an unprecedented scale.”

### Beware of the bear  

As for who would have an interest in wreaking havoc in international waters, the report repeatedly points a finger at Russia, whose Yantar class intelligence ships and auxiliary submarines include the necessary equipment for cutting submarine cables.

In a foreword, Admiral James Stavridis, USN (Ret), former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe, notes that the overwhelming military advantage of NATO forces over Russian troops could result in the country avoiding conventional conflict and focusing instead on attacks against asymmetric targets, like fiber-optic cables.

And then there’s the risk of terrorism.

Non-state actors would struggle to impact the same number of cables as a nation-state, although this is still a possibility - the location of cables is made public to avoid fishing vessels accidentally dropping anchors on them, something a terrorist could do intentionally.

Another, perhaps easier to reach, target for terrorists could be found in cable landing stations.

### Recommendations  

With readers suitably unnerved by a litany of threats, the report makes nine UK-focused recommendations:

1. **Strategic Defence And Security Review** - The next Strategic Defence Review should take into account the threat to attacks on submarine cable infrastructure.
2. **National Risk Assessment and Risk Register** - The next National Risk Assessment should look into the risk of these attacks.
3. **Secure Landing Sites** - The government should instruct the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) to carry out a full review of how landing sites are protected.
4. **Establish Cable Protection Zones** - The report states that Britain should establish Australian-style Cable Protection Zones (CPZs) around its coast in areas with cable corridors.
5. **Deploy Better Monitoring Equipment on Cables** - The report states that cable laying companies could be required to place sensors that detect sonar frequencies near key undersea infrastructure.
6. **Broaden Geographic Diversity** - The report wants Britain to work with the private sector and overseas governments to increase the geographic diversity of submarine cables.
7. **Increase the Supply of “Dark Cables”** - The government could encourage backup cable systems and redundant networks by offering tax incentives.
8. **Strengthen International Law Protecting Cables** - The report states that the UK should push for the adoption of a new international treaty that protects submarine cables.
9. **Increase NATO Naval Exercises and Review Maritime Capabilities** - The report wants the UK to press at the NATO level to promote naval exercises to hone potential responses to an attack on undersea cable infrastructure.

In response to the report, a UK government spokesperson said the issue was being taken “extremely seriously.”","The article titled ""UK think tank warns of threats to submarine cables"" discusses various threats to submarine telecommunications cables, which are crucial for international connectivity.

The Sirius South cable itself was originally deployed in 1998 by NTL, which later became part of Virgin Media after the merger with Telewest. Virgin also operates a second cable on a similar route called Sirius North, which affords them some redundancy should one of the two links end up being damaged.

There have been 18 instances of damage, allegedly involving trawlers, since the Sirius cables were installed.

Sadly, cable breaks are not uncommon on subsea routes. Most such damage occurs due to accidents by deep sea fishing trawlers, as well as ships dragging their anchor over them or marine life deciding to take a nibble. A whole industry exists to repair such cables, but it often takes a few days or weeks to fix related damage.

In this case, Virgin Media has claimed in the High Court that the vessel in question was allegedly conducting scallop fishing, which involves dredging the seabed. Virgin Media wants the vessel’s owners to pay damages and, failing that, they would like to see it sold to help pay off the claim.

A Virgin Media spokesperson said: ""We have brought this claim following significant damage caused by a fishing trawler to one of our undersea fibre optic cables, and are seeking to recover the costs associated with repairing the cable. As a business with millions of customers who rely on fast and reliable connectivity, we hope that through taking this action, third parties will be better aware of the cost that can be involved and disruption it can cause when our cables are damaged.""

Cases like this can be complicated and tricky to pursue, which may help to explain why it’s taken so long for this one to reach the courts. The vessel’s owners have denied that they were the cause of the damage and have asked for proof of this. They have also accused Virgin of being negligent by failing to take sufficient measures to protect the cable when it was installed, such as by burying it.

Finally, the owners claim that the location is an ""area of fishing ground established centuries past"" and that they were doing nothing more than the lawful exploitation of fishing rights. The owners say that Virgin Media has no entitlement to expect or demand that fishing be modified, or stopped, just because it laid a cable across the same area.

However, Virgin Media contends that shipping regulations require such vessels to carry publications that would have alerted the vessel’s owners to the location of subsea cables, and that there was also an alleged failure to ensure the skipper and/or crew were adequately aware of the location of such cables.

Virgin has previously filed a similar case against the MV Willie Joe trawler, which was settled in 2022.","The article titled ""Virgin Media Sues Fishing Trawler for Allegedly Damaging Subsea Cable"" discusses a lawsuit filed by Virgin Media against a fishing trawler for allegedly damaging one of their subsea fibre optic cables.

It directly mentions 'subsea cables' and provides context about the implications of such damage, including the financial claims and the operational impact on Virgin Media.

The article states that 'cable breaks are not uncommon on subsea routes' and that 'most such damage occurs due to accidents by deep sea fishing trawlers'.

This shows that the topic of cut sea cables is treated as a central theme, not just a minor mention.

Therefore, the article satisfies the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables."

The horrific earthquake and the ensuing tsunami in Japan have caused widespread damage to undersea communications, according to data collected by telecom industry sources. Initially, it was thought that the damage to the cables that connect Japan and Asia to each other and other parts of the world was limited, but new data shows the extent of the problems.  
According to research firm, Telegeography, the following cables have been damaged:  
* APCN-2, which is an intra-Asian cable, forms a ring linking China, Hong Kong, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan.  
* Pacific Crossing West and Pacific Crossing North, which are out of service.  
* PacNet has reported outages on segments of its East Asia Crossing network.  
* Korea Telecom reports that a segment of the Japan-U.S. Cable Network is damaged.  
* NTT has reported damage to some segments of the PC-1 submarine cable system.  
Most of the damaged network routers land in the Ajigaura or Kitabaraki landing stations, which are between Tokyo and Sendai. The tsunami and earthquake have not damaged Japan’s cable landing stations that are in the South of Tokyo, or on the other side of the sheltered inlet that becomes Tokyo Bay, Telegeography said.  
“We’re not aware of disruptions to any of the many cables that land here,” Stephan Beckart of Telegeography wrote in an email. “All of the cable systems that have reported outages also operate cables that land to the South of Tokyo, so no system appears to have suffered a complete outage.  
A report from Dow Jones Newswires suggests most companies are working hard to fix the network problems. The Dow Jones report has the following additional details:  
* KDDI says its cable between the U.S. and Japan is broken and it cannot transmit signals.  
* NTT is using back-up cable systems.  
* PCCW says the Internet traffic to the U.S. is slow.  
In a story on Friday, Stacey Higginbotham pointed out that Chunghwa of Taiwan had reported an outage on the APCN-2 system, while China Unicom had reported some unspecified damage to “two or three cables.” There is clear decline in Japan’s Internet performance, according to the data from JPNAP.","The article titled ""In Japan, Many Undersea Cables Are Damaged"" discusses the significant damage to various undersea cables as a direct result of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.

It mentions specific cables that were affected, including the APCN-2, Japan-U.S. Cable Network, and PC-1 submarine cable system.

The article emphasizes the implications of these damages, such as outages reported by KDDI and NTT, and the slowdown of internet traffic to the U.S. due to these disruptions.

This focus on the damages to undersea cables and their impact on telecommunications and internet connectivity clearly aligns with the criterion of being an article on the topic of cut sea cables.

December 27, 2006 / 5:47 AM EST / CBS/AP  

Telephone and Internet service was disrupted across Asia on Wednesday after a powerful earthquake off Taiwan's southern tip damaged undersea cables used by phone customers and Web surfers from Japan to Southeast Asia and the United States.

Repairing the cables harmed by Tuesday's tremor — which killed two people — could take three weeks but ""quality will improve day by day,"" said Lin Jen-hung, vice general manager of Chunghwa Telecom Co., Taiwan's largest phone company.

The 6.7-magnitude quake — which triggered a tsunami alert — damaged two of the seven undersea cables near Taiwan used by several countries to route calls and Internet traffic, Chunghwa said. Crews fixing the cables would have to pull them up and transfer them to a ship for repair, the company said.

The damage to the two lines, located in the south, cut off 50 percent to 60 percent of Chunghwa's overall telephone capacity, the company said. Most severely affected were connections to China, Japan and Southeast Asia, it said.

Also hard hit was telephone service to the U.S., where 60 percent of capacity was lost, the company said.

Chunghwa also said 98 percent of Taiwan's communications capacity with Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Hong Kong was disrupted.

Hong Kong telephone company PCCW Ltd., which also provides Internet service, said the quake cut its data capacity in half. Many Internet users were unable to access Web sites in parts of America, Taiwan and South Korea. Calls to Taiwan weren't connecting.

Internet access has been cut or has become extremely slow in Beijing, said an official from China Netcom, China's No. 2 phone company.

The official, who would not give his name, said the cause was thought to be the earthquake, but he had no further details.

Businesses in various parts of the city also said they were experiencing Internet access problems.

CCTV, the state-run television network, said China Telecom Corp., China's biggest phone company, was contacting counterparts in the U.S. and Europe about using satellites to make up for the shortfall.

KDDI Corp., Japan's major carrier for international calls, said its fixed-line telephone service was affected by the quake. Company spokesman Haruhiko Maeda said customers were having trouble calling India and the Middle East, which are usually use the cables near Taiwan. Maeda said the company was rerouting calls to go through the U.S. and Europe and the company did not know how long it will take to repair the cables.

Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said that international roaming service provided by Japan's major three telecommunications — NTT DoCoMO, KDDI, and Softbank, was affected. Ministry official Akira Yamanaka said that some customers were unable to make calls using their mobile phones in countries including Taiwan.

South Korea's largest telecom company, KT, said that lines it uses were damaged, affecting dozens of companies and institutions, including South Korea's Foreign Ministry.

However, the quake didn't cause problems for ordinary people using Internet and telephone service, according to Ku Ja-hong, a KT spokesman.

The quake, which hit offshore from the southern town of Hengchun, came on the second anniversary of the tsunami that killed more than 200,000 lives in southern Asia.

Tuesday's tremor was felt throughout Taiwan. It shook buildings and knocked objects off the shelves in the capital, Taipei, in the northern part of the island.

Two members of one family were killed in Hengchun when their four-story home collapsed. The quake injured 42 people, three homes collapsed and 12 fires broke out, the National Fire Agency said.

Quakes frequently shake Taiwan, which is part of the Pacific's ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of volcanos and fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin. Most are minor and cause little or no damage. However, a 7.6-magnitude earthquake in central Taiwan in September 1999 killed more than 2,300 people.","The article ""Quake Knocks Out Asian Phone, Internet"" discusses the impact of a powerful earthquake off the southern tip of Taiwan that damaged undersea cables.

It directly mentions ""undersea cables"" and describes how their damage led to significant disruptions in telephone and internet service across Asia and to the United States.

The ship, according to reports, was loaded with fibre optic cables in Cape Town harbour and set off to the coastal waters of Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire on Tuesday evening. Its estimated arrival time in Abidjan is 06:00 on Friday, 29 March 2024. The ship is equipped with general cable works tools and a remotely operated vehicle for detecting, cutting, recovering, jointing and testing undersea fibre cables. It can handle repairs in waters as shallow as 10 meters and as deep as 7 km.

A second ship, Global Marine’s CS Sovereign, is also expected to attend to the cable breaks, but it is still moored in Portland, England, as of 08:15 on Wednesday, 20 March 2024.

On Thursday, 14 March 2024, four submarine telecommunications cables connecting African countries to Europe and other parts of the world went offline around 12:30. The cables that broke were the West Africa Cable System (WACS), Africa Coast to Europe (ACE), MainOne, and SAT–3 cables. Earlier breaks on the Seacom, EIG, and AAE–1 cables suspected to have been caused by Houthi terrorists sinking a fertilizer ship in the Red Sea in late February have also led to lowered capacity on the east coast of Africa.

The cause of the cable breaks remains to be confirmed, but preliminary analysis by submarine fibre cable operator MainOne indicates that seismic activity on the seabed caused its submarine fibre cable to break. MainOne said that the distance from land and the cable depth of about 3 km at the point of the fault ruled out any kind of human activity, including damage from ship anchors, fishing, drilling, or sabotage.

Whether you see this as promoting Russia as a bogeyman, or a real possibility, the reality is that history has demonstrated that undersea Internet cables can be cut, and that it wreaks havoc.

In fact, in early 2008 there were a rash of undersea cables being severed. In all, five cables were cut, in disparate locations, leading to many being certain that it was a concerted effort, and not coincident accidents.

All told, more than 80 million people in several countries were taken offline as four undersea cables servicing India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Egypt, Iran, and Qatar were severed, with a fifth cable sever cutting off Iran the following day.

Several months later, in December of 2008, three undersea Internet cables were severed, leading to an Internet outage affecting, among others, Egypt, Syria, Pakistan, Qatar, India, Taiwan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Djibouti, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Malaysia, the Maldives, Yemen, and Zambia.

So, cable severing is nothing new. It’s also not to be taken lightly.

As Rear Admiral Frederick Roegge, Commander of the Navy’s sub fleet in the Pacific, told the New York Times in an interview this week, “I’m worried every day about what the Russians may be doing.” (The Times says that Roegge “would not comment about possible Russian plans for cutting the undersea cables.”)

Again, the concern of a security threat in the form of undersea Internet cables being intentionally cut is nothing new.

In 2012, Michael Sechrist, an expert formerly with MIT’s Explorations in Cyber International Relations (ECIR), and now Vice President for Threat and Risk Management with the State Street Corporation, released a report on the vulnerabilities of undersea comm cables, through the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government.

The report, New Threats, Old Technology: Vulnerabilities in Undersea Communications Cable Network Management Systems, points out that “Poor physical security of cable landing sites is a potential Achilles heel for U.S. and global cyber security. Cable landing sites have always been and continue to be single points of potentially catastrophic attack and failure that must be addressed. Today, however, risk to global safety and security is compounded by the vulnerability of cable systems to cyber attacks through new network management systems.”

“The risk here is that any country could cause damage to the system and do it in a way that is completely covert,” Sechrist told the Times, adding that they could do it without even having a ship with cable-cutting equipment in the area.

That said, not everybody thinks that it is likely.

Keir Giles, an associate fellow with the Russia and Eurasia Programme at British think tank Chatham House told the BBC that “I very much doubt that anyone would think of cutting off the US. It is only going to work in locations where the internet geography is going to create a vulnerability in communications,” adding that to truly cut off the U.S. would be nearly impossible owing to the vast number of Internet connections leading to and from the United States.

“You’d need a lot of submarines to actually harm a country like the United States,” Keith Schofield, of the International Cable Protection Committee, told NPR.

Still, as Sechrist points out in his paper, more than a decade ago then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice observed that “The cyber economy is the economy. Corrupt those networks and you disrupt this nation.”","The article titled ""Why the U.S. is Concerned about Russian Submarine Activity near Undersea Internet Cables"" directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables.

It discusses the potential threat posed by Russian submarines to undersea cables, specifically mentioning that these cables can be severed, which would severely impact U.S. internet operations.

The article references historical incidents, such as the cutting of five undersea cables in 2008, which resulted in widespread internet outages affecting millions.

This context illustrates not only the risks associated with undersea cables but also their critical role in global internet connectivity.

The inclusion of expert opinions on the vulnerabilities of these cables further emphasizes the article's focus on the topic.

The magnitude 9.0 earthquake that rocked Japan last Friday damaged some undersea data cables, but caused surprisingly few disruptions to the country's Internet and telephone network, according to representatives of the country's telecom industry.

Pacific Crossing, a subsidiary of the Japanese telecom giant, NTT, reported on its website that its PC-1 West undersea cable, connecting the southern Japanese city of Shima with Ajigaura, 136 kilometers north of Tokyo, was severed.

Pacific Cable's PC-1 North cable, which runs from Ajigaura to Harbour Pointe near Seattle on the United States West Coast, was also severed.

While it may often seem like the Internet is a vast, borderless network, in reality it relies on a series of fiber optic cables that are encased to protect against earthquakes, shipping traffic, and marine life.

Sometimes damaged cables, particularly at certain bottlenecks, can lead to service outages in some parts of the world. Most recently in Asia, the December 2006 earthquake in Taiwan disrupted Internet service across the region for several weeks.

""We are trying to restore capacity right now,"" said Koji Kimura, a Pacific Crossing spokesperson, in an interview with Deutsche Welle. ""[Those cables] are no longer in use, but unfortunately the cable was physically cut due to the tsunami wave - half of our capacity is down.""

The company also has an additional cable that runs down the west coast of the United States, from Harbour Pointe, to Grover Beach in California, which is known as PC-1 East, and an additional cable that runs from California back to southern Japan, known as PC-1 South.

Kimura said the diversion had not affected most customers' level of service on the whole.

In a statement, the company said it expected its northern and western cables to be repaired by March 29 and April 19 respectively. However, this schedule could yet be ""subject to change due to radiation levels"" at the Fukushima plant in the area of the company's cable faults.

Another Japanese telecom company, KDDI, the country's second-largest telecom provider, also reported that the Japan-US cable, a major undersea cable connecting Shima with California had been damaged.

""That cable was broken but we have another backup cable so that we are still providing services continuously,"" said Satoru Ito, a KDDI spokesperson, in an interview with Deutsche Welle.

The company said it would send out a ship with diving robots to repair the cable. However, that could take months, Ito said, as the company does not yet know exactly where the damage occurred.

KDDI is currently partially re-routing some of its traffic through the Russia-Japan cable network, which connects Japan's western coast with a Russian landing station outside of Vladivostok, just north of Japan.

""There is no difference between this backup cable and the one we were using usually, there is no [difference] to the customers,"" Ito said.

Taiwan's leading telecom operator, Chunghwa Telecom, also confirmed that the Japan-US and the APCN-2 cable were damaged. The latter cable connects Japan, China, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines.

Chen Hui-yen, a company manager, told the Agence France Presse on Wednesday that company bandwidth capacity had been reduced by 30 percent, noting that it could take over a month to repair the rupture.

""There were impacts, but they were limited,"" she said. ""As of now we have received few complaints from customers.""

Telecom industry experts are impressed with the Japanese network's resilience.

Telecom industry analysts said it was still too early to say how badly the region's undersea cables were damaged.

""My colleagues are in the process to analyze the situation in Japan after the massive earthquake and subsequent tsunami in the areas interested,"" wrote Cristina Bardelli, a spokesperson with the German telecom industry analysis firm InfoCom, in an e-mail sent to Deutsche Welle.

She added that in the immediate aftermath of the quake, mobile phone service in eastern Japan was either overloaded or damaged, but that overall, Japan's telecom companies were able to respond ""very quickly."" She said Japan's infrastructure was ""very stable,"" composed of ""good technology"" and of ""strong quality.""

""As far as we can judge, the fixed infrastructure was less damaged than the mobile one,"" she said, adding that it was not yet possible to provide percentage figures of the extent of the damage as ""the information from the Japanese side is very careful.""

""But connection to the Internet appeared virtually unaffected. Amazon Web services had just opened a data center, which apparently is running normally. We have information that some carriers providing broadband access have opened their networks, for instance Softbank, and people can connect to the internet through WiFi hotspot free of charge.""

Last Friday (March 11), James Cowie, the CTO of the American Internet analysis firm Renesys, posted on a company blog that Japanese Internet connectivity had ""survived this event better than anyone would have expected.""

""The engineers who built Japan's Internet created a dense web of domestic and international connectivity that is among the richest and most diverse on earth, as befits a critical gateway for global connectivity in and out of East Asia,"" he wrote.

By Angelina Rascouet (Bloomberg) — For decades, ships owned by French phone carrier Orange SA have traveled the world’s oceans, installing and fixing the undersea cables that carry internet traffic from one continent to another.  

The fleet of six run by Orange Marine is now looking to diversify, even with the biggest investment boom for the infrastructure since the 1990s. Instead of creating more business, the new high-capacity lines being financed by the tech giants are expected to put older cables out of service, meaning less work for the seaborne repairmen.  

One cable that started up last year highlights the issue. The line, running from the U.S. state of Virginia to Sopelana, Spain, accounts for half the capacity of the dozen or so trans-Atlantic cables. Known as Marea, the 6,600-kilometer (4,101-mile) link owned by Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Telefonica SA’s Telxius offers the fastest data transmission speeds in the world.  

Jean-Luc Vuillemin, who oversees Orange Marine, sees potential opportunities in servicing offshore wind turbines, he said in an interview on the Pierre de Fermat, a 100-meter ship named after the 17th-century mathematician and docked at the Brest port in northwest France.  

“The ecosystem is pretty favorable right now but this may change in the future,” Vuillemin said. “You need to diversify when the business is in order, so we’re thinking about the next steps.”  

**Strategic Asset**  
Orange Marine is a small yet profitable business for France’s dominant phone carrier, generating about 100 million euros ($112 million) of annual sales out of Orange’s roughly 41 billion euros of revenue. But it’s considered a strategic asset by the company, whose largest shareholder is the French state.  

Being able to quickly repair cables can be crucial in an emergency, as Algeria experienced in 2015 when a link between Annaba in the country’s northeast and Marseille in southern France was cut by an anchor, disrupting internet service in the North African nation for almost a week.  

Together, Orange Marine and its France-based competitor at Nokia Oyj, Alcatel Submarine Networks, own about one-quarter of the 40 or so ships focused on subsea cables globally, Vuillemin said.  

“Our Western economies are increasingly dependent on these subsea cables. Orange Marine provides strategic autonomy. It’s a matter of sovereignty.”

Things at the bottom of the sea: pale fish, manganese nodules, plastic trash and cables. Lots of cables.

In our wireless, satellite-broadcasted world, it's easy to forget that most of our electronic communications still run through wires. This includes the vast majority of international calls, text messages and Internet transmissions, which must be ferried through cables that stretch across continents at the bottom of the ocean.

These undersea cables are easy to forget, since they are well out of sight and mind. But without them, the world as we know it would cease to exist.

**What is something most people don't know about undersea cables?**

Most people probably don't know that 99 percent of all transoceanic data traffic goes through undersea cables, and that includes Internet usage, phone calls and text messages. This route is also faster than satellite transmissions, by up to eight-fold.

**Can these communications on these cables be tapped into or intercepted?**

They have been in the past. There are concerns this could be or is happening now.

**When were these things installed?**

The first transatlantic cable was laid in the 1860s, and these telegraph cables lasted for 60 to 70 years or even longer underwater.

**What has been the most catastrophic failure in the history of undersea cables?**

In 2006 there was a magnitude 7.0 earthquake off Taiwan that severed eight cables, disrupting much of the Internet traffic to and from China. It took 11 cable ships a total of 49 days to complete the repairs.

**How are breakages avoided?**

Cablemen can avoid hazards like undersea mountains. The biggest problem has always been people dropping anchors or trawl nets.

**How are the cables repaired?**

It's actually not that difficult. The cable company contracts a ship to go to the exact spot where the break is.

The complaints had been coming in through Twitter and online forums the entire day, but it was not until late in the afternoon that confirmation came from ZDNet Asia that the problem was due to a fault in the APCN2 system, which serves a large part of the Asia-Pacific region.

The fault means users are only getting slow connections to overseas websites. Webpages are displaying slowly, while IM (instant messaging) messages are often slow to go through or are dropped altogether.

Quoting Malaysian telecom operator TM, ZDNet Asia said that the fault appears to be off the coast of China.

According to a notice sent by Malaysian telco, TM Net, the cable fault was traced to segment 7 of the APCN2, which stretches between Shantou, China and Tanshui, Taiwan. TM Net traced the outage to Typhoon Morakot, which hit the region over the weekend.

Additionally, segment 1 of the APCN2 is also currently under repair. Repairs on segment 7 are expected to commence after work on segment 1 is completed.

Submarine cable cuts are commonly affected by typhoons and earthquakes. During the Asian telecom blackout of December 2006, communications in the region came to standstill after a quake in Taiwan damaged several cable systems at one go, leaving few backup options for telcos.

Submarine cables are also prone to damage from ships. Following the routes of global commerce, the cables are usually laid along busy shipping lanes, where vessels are known to accidentally break the cables while dropping anchor.

Just last month, TM said APCN2 suffered a cut in the segment between Kuantan and Katong, Singapore, slowing down the access of many Malaysian users.

Speeds are expected to be back to normal tomorrow evening, according to ZDNet Asia.

The only time the world is even aware of the undersea cables that carry internet signals around the world is when they are cut off - such as when a cable connecting Europe to the Middle East failed last year, or when a trailing ship's anchor cut through a cable under the Indian ocean.

Now, a new interactive map from Telegeography should help ships to steer clear of the multi-billion-dollar network of high-power cables through which 99 per cent of global internet traffic travels.

Broadband under the sea: The cables that connect the continents

The map - using info from the Global Bandwidth Research Service - shows the position of cables (both planned ones and ones currently on the sea bed), and lets you know their landing stations, who owns them, how long they are, and when they'll come into operation if they are not already. The version on Telegeography's site lets you click on any cable to find out more.

Tim Stronge, of Telegeography, who created the map, says, 'Submarine cables are very expensive to build (generally ranging from $100m - $500m) but they deliver a huge amount of capacity.'

'Each cable costs about $10m a year in maintenance costs -- the price operators have to pay to keep repair ships on standby, and other costs. If a cable breaks (which happens surprisingly frequently), the owner(s) of the cable also have to pay a repair ship to go out to sea and splice the cable, to the tune of $10,000 per day.'

Failures can be catastrophic. One cable failure - between Sicily and Egypt - left more than 50 per cent of India without power in 2008, sending the country's computer industry and stock markets offline for hours.","The article discusses undersea cables, including specific incidents where cables were cut and the consequences of those cuts on internet connectivity.

This is an essential resource for global business, as it allows the Internet to reach all corners of the planet, since wireless technology and satellite connections don’t have the same reliability and speed in data transmission. This improved performance is fostering the continuous spread of cables with private and public capital.

Humanity’s interest in being connected via submarine cable dates back to 1852, when a telecommunications network was laid between Great Britain and France through the English Channel to connect both countries to the telegraph network. It took another two years for the first transoceanic installation, thanks to Atlantic Telegraph Company, which placed a cable for telegraphic transmission between the Canadian island of Newfoundland and Ireland. Nevertheless, technical problems delayed the first stable transatlantic connection until 1866, and it was not until 1956 that a telephone line was installed.

Another milestone in the story was the appearance of fiber optics. According to Mariano Martínez and Noelia Miranda, member of the Board of Directors and head of Technical Development and Training at the Official Association of Telecommunications Engineers (COIT), respectively, modern submarine cables are made of optical fiber and based on the properties of pure fiberglass where light travels via internal reflection. “Due to light losing intensity throughout the cable, boosters are required at regular intervals to reestablish the intensity of the optical signal,” they said.

One of the greatest technical concerns is material durability in such an aggressive environment as the one underwater; cables are usually expected to last an average of 25 years. In order to ensure durability, the optical fibers are protected with a series of concentric layers that safeguard the interior. These layers are made of copper and polyethylene. They also have steel protection to be able to provide mechanical traction and resistance on the seabed. In the event that the cables are responsible for transporting electricity, they are also inserted in a special pipe to prevent the risk of contact with water.

In any case, once the source and destination of the cables have been defined, a bathymetric survey is carried out to design the route it will go through, i.e., “a 3D analysis of the ocean floor to determine the least turbulent path where the cable is least likely to be damaged.”

Nevertheless, the ocean floor is not a flat surface, but rather a turbulent one with depressions, rocks, mountains, etc. That’s why fishing areas and faults are avoided when planning the cable’s final path and, wherever possible, boats unroll the cable over sandy floors instead of rocky ones. Other issues can arise from fishing boat and shipping accidents as well as the use of anchors. As Martínez and Miranda pointed out, sometimes the cables are even damaged by shark bites.

They must also be prepared for earthquakes. One occurring near Taiwan in 2006 (7.0 magnitude) broke eight cables and seriously affected communications in China. Today, movement sensors are placed on the ocean floor so that if the tremors begin there, the speed with which the cable can give a warning provides a great deal of leeway to anticipate situations in cities.

> There are 378 submarine cables laid around the world, with a total length of 1.2 million kilometers

There are mechanisms to monitor the submarine cables and prevent the deteriorations caused by the fishing and shipping industries. The landing point (where the submarine cable makes landfall) plays a decisive role in guaranteeing proper functioning of the service in security protocols. The landing point, which works in conjunction with the Network Operations Center, has a series of technological tools to monitor the entire system in real time.

If the cable is damaged, repairs are done on the surface. “The damaged ends are retrieved by a submarine robot and the damage is then repaired, connected, or resolved on board special ships,” highlighted the COIT engineers.

In addition to the physical security of the cable, there are three international treaties that legally protect these lines. The most important laws notably include the freedom to lay, maintain, and repair submarine cables up to 12 nautical miles outside territorial waters and the national obligation to impose criminal and civil penalties on anyone who intentionally or negligently damages a cable.

Submarine cables mostly belong to large telecommunications firms. Some state and government-owned companies also have stakes in them and there are so-called consortium cables, which are the product of agreements between several companies such as Microsoft, Facebook, and Google.

There are several international projects. Google announced its intention to finance three new submarine cables that will connect five regions of the world. Next year, it will finance three submarine cable projects: Curie, a private cable that will connect Chile and Los Angeles; Havfrue, a consortium aiming to connect the US to Denmark and Ireland; and the Hong-Kong-Guam cable system, another consortium that will connect different underground communications centers throughout Asia.

The installation of the first cable to directly connect Europe and South America is very significant, since up until now cables have gone to the United States and then connected to South America from there. The European Commission will provide 26.5 million euros, making it the largest investor in the Bella project – driven by a public-private partnership – which will involve laying 10,000 kilometers of cable under the Atlantic between Alentejo, Portugal, and Fortaleza, Brazil.

In Spain, most submarine cables start in the south, but another cable was recently rolled out in the north: Marea, a project driven by Telxius, Facebook, and Microsoft to connect Virginia Beach (east coast of the United States), where the largest concentration of data centers in the world is located, to Sopelana (Bizkaia) “thereby allowing two people separated by the Atlantic Ocean to communicate in less than one second.”

> 99% of transoceanic communications are done via submarine cables, which achieve speeds up to eight times faster than the satellite network

The great deal of interest from private companies and public institutions in these cables originates from the increase in connectivity across the planet. There are currently approximately 378 submarine cables laid around the world, with a total length of 1.2 million kilometers. The speed of development will increase in the short term. According to a Telegraphy report commissioned by DE-CIX, in the next three years there will be up to 74 systems more than 300,000 kilometers long, which are expected to have an estimated 8.8 billion dollar investment in the top submarine routes.

Their mission is fundamental since, according to Noelia Miranda and Mariano Martínez, although communications satellites cover part of the communications demand (especially for television and Internet), fiber optic submarine cables are the true Internet superhighways: “99% of transoceanic communications are done in this way, achieving speeds up to eight times faster than the satellite network,” they concluded.

One factor working in their favor is that they are not affected by atmospheric phenomena such as storms and cyclones, unlike satellites, and the path they cross is considerably shorter. For instance, the distance between Tokyo and Los Angeles is approximately 9,000 kilometers and a fiber optic cable will always give data a shorter path to travel than a satellite. This path will generally be above 36,000 kilometers, while Internet data carried via satellite has to go up to the satellite and then back down, doubling the journey (more than 72,000 kilometers).

Additionally, “in the future the evolution of technological equipment will allow us to double or quadruple capacity, as has occurred since older cables,” stated the COIT experts. This is essential, as data traffic in 2024 will have increased by 24%, according to Cisco. They advocate for greater development of oceanographic observatories to improve cable technology. However, both design and operations are continually evolving and new, smaller systems with greater capacity and reliability are being developed to cover all future communications needs.

Powerful tremors from Tuesday's earthquake near the southern tip of Taiwan damaged undersea cables, disrupting internet and telephone communications across Southeast Asia.  
Telecommunications companies said the 6.7-magnitude earthquake forced them to activate backup systems after tens of millions of internet and telephone users were cut off from service Wednesday.  
The earthquake claimed the lives of two Taiwanese residents and injured more than 40 people, and the communications breakdown also hit the island hard, as Taiwan is Asia's fifth-largest economy.  
Initial tremors on Tuesday set off alerts about a possible tsunami on the second anniversary of the waves that killed about 230,000 people in Southeast Asia, but the region was spared further disaster.  
Chunghwa Telecom Co., Taiwan's largest phone company, said the tremors damaged two underwater cables off the Taiwanese coast, which link communications between several Asian countries.  
As a result, the company lost at least half of its telephone capacity, meaning connections have been cut off to China, Japan and other parts of Southeast Asia, company spokesman Wu Chih-ming said.  
**Repairs could take weeks**  
The island's undersea cable system includes seven interconnected lines, in which damage to one line can affect the others.  
Wu said it could take weeks of repairs until calls can be properly routed and connected, and damaged portions must first be hauled on board ships for the work to begin.  
""On average, if the problems with the cables are less than 1,000 metres deep, the repair teams should only need two weeks,"" he said. ""But if it's deeper, it could take three weeks.""  
Neighbouring countries, including China, Japan and South Korea, have also reported online and telephone glitches.  
In Hong Kong, web users could not connect to sites in parts of the U.S., Taiwan and South Korea.  
Repair vessels are not expected to begin work before the end of next week.","The article titled ""Taiwan tremors cripple internet, phone service"" clearly discusses the impact of an earthquake that damaged undersea cables, which are synonymous with the term 'cut sea cables'.

It mentions that the earthquake caused significant disruptions in internet and telephone communications across Southeast Asia, as telecommunications companies had to activate backup systems due to the loss of connections.

Specific references to 'undersea cables' and the consequences of their damage on connectivity confirm that the article treats this topic as a central theme.

Therefore, it satisfies the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables."

Your photos, uploaded to Google's cloud, do not float in the ether. Your iCloud backups do not break bread with the gods. The metaverse that Facebook is so keen on building will not exist in the heavens.

The name “cloud” is a linguistic trick – a way of hiding who controls the underlying technology of the internet – and the huge power they wield. Stop to think about it for a moment and the whole notion is bizarre. The cloud is, in fact, a network of cables and servers that cover the world: once the preserve of obscure telecoms firms, it is now, increasingly, owned and controlled by Big Tech – with Google and Facebook claiming a lion’s share.

Building data centre capacity is something of a full-time job for Big Tech. Here, in vast facilities spread across the world, your most private photos and messages sit on a hard drive on an anonymous computer on an anonymous rack, stacked alongside thousands of others in an out-of-town data centre, sited somewhere where energy and land are cheap.

The cloud is a hulking physical network. It forms a part of the internet’s backbone, which itself is overwhelmingly made up of a network of cables intersecting the world’s oceans. It is easy to imagine these as larger or grander than they are – in reality they are generally the width of a hosepipe, buried for a short distance from shore for security, but beyond that point allowed to sit freely on the sea bed.

A conversation with Bruce Neilson-Watts, who spent 16 years as a navigator, engineer and then a captain of boats working to lay and repair the cables, sheds a little more light on what they look like and how they work. The actual part of the cable which carries information across the continent is just the tiniest core of the hosepipe-width cable, with even that tiny thickness able to carry up to 100GBps or even 400GBps on newer cables in the smallest fractions of a second.

Much of the rest of the width is made up of petroleum jelly – yes, the same stuff that comes in a Vaseline jar – intended to protect the cables from water damage and corrosion, meaning even the physical structure of the internet is, in fact, lubed up. Make of that what you will.

The ownership of the data centres – and often as a result, our data – that power the internet is a matter of almost constant public debate. It’s the issue that drives conversations about tech monopolies and the overbearing power of internet platforms. But the same cannot be said of those transatlantic cables, almost 1.5 million kilometres of which now traverse almost every part of the globe.

These operators tend to stay out of sight. In reality, many of the world’s international cables are often owned by consortia of companies, who are often rivals in other contexts. Some major internet cables list as many as 50 owners, while only around a quarter appear to be operated by one company.

These companies charge others for the amount of data they transmit through the cables they own, but also barter access to cables owned by others in exchange for free access to theirs – a quiet share-and-share-alike system behind huge telecoms companies, all behind the scenes.

The world’s biggest owner of cables is a household name, at least to Americans – it’s AT&T, which has a stake in around 230,000 kilometres of international internet cabling, or around one sixth of the total. But looking at others in the top ten reveals why both Big Tech and Western governments are starting to pay the apparently dull issue of cable ownership more attention: in second place is China Telecom, while Chunghwa Telecom (based in Taiwan) is third and China Unicorn is sixth.

In the tenth and eleventh spots, however, are some very familiar names: Facebook and Google. Big Tech is getting into big cables – and doing so in a big way. Over the past few years, 80 percent of investment in new cables has flowed from the two US tech giants. As of today, Facebook owns or co-owns 99,399 kilometres of cables, Google 95,876 kilometres. And more investments are on their way: in August, Facebook and Google announced their plans for building a 12,000 kilometre undersea cable, Apricot, which will link Singapore, Japan, Guam, the Philippines, Taiwan and Indonesia when completed in 2024. For Google, that came hot on the heels of a previous announcement about the Echo subsea cable, which will connect California, Singapore, Guam and Indonesia. For its part, Facebook has thrown its weight behind the coalition of telcos building what might turn out to be the longest subsea cable ever: 2Africa, a 45,000 kilometre-long cord planned to encompass the whole African continent and connect 33 countries in Africa, Europe and the Middle-East by 2024. In May 2020 Bloomberg reported that the project will cost under $1 billion – but that was before Facebook announced several expansions to the initial design.

The stated motivations for these efforts vary. Facebook especially frames part of its effort as being about improving internet access across the world – while admitting some advantage to itself through user growth if this succeeds. Google mostly highlights how greater connectivity will boost local economic prosperity.

Many internet cables follow the telecoms routes laid out in the early twentieth century, and so efforts to build huge new cables serving non-western countries (like, in a way, the 2Africa cable) are framed as an effort to decolonise the internet, albeit an uncomfortable one given the mix of companies and groups involved.

The tech giants have privacy and security reasons to get into cables, too. In 2013, when The Guardian and The Washington Post published revelations from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, the story that most angered American tech firms (especially Google) was about how the agency was intercepting traffic sent internally between their data centres.

Google’s response to this was both to ratchet up its use of encryption, even for traffic travelling internally (which can still mean across continents), and to increase its reliance on entirely private fibre-optic cables for such communications. And when you think like Google and the other tech giants, once you’re in the cable game, you might as well get in properly.

Tom Wheeler, the former chairman of the USA’s Federal Communications Commission under president Obama – and self-avowed former lobbyist for the cable industry – says that Big Tech’s foray into cable-laying has also affected cable companies’ thinking. “The networks themselves are wildly jealous of, and therefore, are trying to assimilate into [Big Tech],” he says. Seeing Big Tech take a huge slice of the profit from the internet as platforms, many cable companies want to be platforms too, he explains. “Why did AT&T buy DirecTV? Why did they buy Time Warner, et cetera? They want to get into these platform activities.”

Where cable companies are realising they are missing out on power by missing out on being platforms, Big Tech platforms are making the opposite realisation: unless they have some sway in distribution, their power will be limited. And the Big Tech companies seem to be managing to buy up stakes in the internet’s backbone much more competently and quietly than their cable counterparts have managed the reverse (just think of the unhappy, short-lived takeover of AOL by Verizon.)

The list of stakeholders in the internet backbone shows who is trying to seize outright control of the internet. And, once again, it looks like the usual suspects have the tightest grip.","The article titled ""Facebook and Google’s New Plan?

**In short:**  
The Danish military is staying close to a Chinese ship in its waters after two underwater telecommunication cables were cut. Some European countries say it was likely an act of sabotage and investigations into the incident have started. Russia has strongly denied any suggestions it was behind the severed cables.

The Danish military is monitoring a Chinese ship in its waters just days after two underwater telecommunication cables were cut in a possible act of sabotage, according to local authorities. European governments accused Russia on Tuesday of escalating hybrid attacks on Ukraine's Western allies. But, the Kremlin has strongly dismissed suggestions it was involved in the damage caused to the telecommunications cables in the Baltic Sea as ""absurd"".

**Undersea cables severed**  
The fibre-optic data cable between Sweden and Lithuania was damaged on Sunday, while the other cable which runs between Finland and Germany was damaged on Monday. This happened in Sweden's exclusive economic zone and Swedish prosecutors have started a preliminary investigation on suspicion of possible sabotage.

German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said Russia poses not just a military but also a hybrid threat and Europe needs to take a broad approach to defence. He added that the damage to the two cables was ""a very clear sign that something is afoot.""

**Russia denies involvement**  
European officials stopped short of directly accusing Russia of destroying the cables. Germany, Poland and others have said it was likely an act of sabotage, Russia criticised any suggestions it was involved in the severed cables incidents. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday ""it is quite absurd to continue to blame Russia for everything without any reason.""

**Why is a Chinese ship being closely watched?**  
The Chinese bulk carrier Yi Peng 3 was anchored in the Kattegat strait between Denmark and Sweden on Wednesday, according to tracking data from a Danish navy patrol ship. Traffic data showed the Chinese ship left the Russian port of Ust-Luga on November 15 and was in the areas where the cable damages occurred, but other ships had also been in the areas.

By Dr. Richard Sauder, PhD  

In the Middle East in the last three days, there have been several undersea, international communications cables that have been cut. On Wednesday, 30 January 2008, two major, undersea communications cables were cut off the Egyptian coast, in the eastern Mediterranean. The story has received prominent play in the international news cycle. Various explanations have been floated in the mainstream news media as to the cause - the most popular culprit being a ""ship anchor"". In any event, communications in the region have been severely disrupted, all the way from Egypt to India, and most points in between.  

Then on Friday, 1 February 2008, an undersea cable in the Persian Gulf, running between Oman and Dubai, was also cut causing severe phone line disruptions and compounding an already existing Internet outage across large parts of the Middle East and Asia.  

There was also a report on Friday, 1 February 2008, of yet another undersea, fiber optic communications cable between Suez and Sri Lanka that has been cut. The reporting is a bit confused; however, given that the Persian Gulf is geographically distant from the Suez, this appears to represent a fourth undersea cable that has been cut.  

So let's see if we can figure this story out. I will say up front that I am well and thoroughly skeptical of the ""ship anchor"" explanation that has been so prominently advanced in the mainstream news media. Yes, ships do sometimes drag their anchors and dragging anchors can cause damage, true enough. But to have three undersea cables -- or is it actually four cables? -- cut in the same region in just a two day span, strains credulity; the more so, when we look at how the damage has played out across the region.  

Two countries in particular stand at conspicuously opposite ends of the continuum of communications disruption.  
1. The website, internettrafficreport.com/asia.htm, reports that as of Friday, 1 February 2008, internet traffic routing through/from/to Iran has been cut to zero. Packet loss is 100%.  
2. Whereas CNN reported on Thursday, 31 January 2008, that internet traffic to Israel has been unaffected because Israel uses a ""different route"". The same CNN article also reports that Lebanon and Iraq have been ""spared the chaos"".  

So, the sudden, unprecedented round of undersea, communications cable cutting in the Middle East leaves Israel and Iraq still connected, while completely shutting down the Iranian internet.  

Funny how that works, isn't it?  

As it happens, the two actors in the international arena in recent years whose rhetoric has expressed the most animus for Iran are the United States and Israel. They have also been by far the most bellicose, Zionist-NeoCon propaganda notwithstanding. Israel and the United States have repeatedly committed military aggression against other countries in the region, and have made many thinly veiled threats of war against Iran. In this decade, the United States has militarily invaded and occupied first Afghanistan, then Iraq, where its forces remain, bogged down in bloody wars of attrition. In the same period, Israel has bombed Syria, bombed and invaded Lebanon, and placed the Palestinian territories under a merciless blockade/occupation/assault. Parallel with these international war crimes, the United States and Israel have repeatedly rattled their sabres against Iran.  

Which brings the discussion back around to the instant spate of undersea, communications cable cutting in the region that has uniquely brought Iranian internet communications to a complete halt, while sparing Israel, which has a different internet route than any of the cut cables, and Iraq, where the American military occupation is bogged down.  

As it happens, the U.S. Navy has for decades had special operations teams that go out on submarines and deploy undersea, on the seabed itself, specifically for cutting or tapping communications cables. The U.S. Navy divers go out through special airlocks and use very sophisticated equipment.  

For the uninitiated it seems bizarre and unlikely, but the plain fact of the matter is that American military divers really go out onto the seabed from special submarines outfitted with airlocks and they actually cut undersea communications cables-- then patch in sophisticated surveillance equipment -- then they splice the cables back together. That is if the motive is espionage. If the purpose of the operation is garden variety sabotage, then simply cutting the cable suffices. It's like something out of a spy novel thriller, but the U.S. Navy really does have submarines and deep diving, special operations personnel who specialize in precisely this sort of operation. So cutting a few undersea cables in two or three days is well within the operational capabilities of the United States Navy.  

Couple this little known, but very important fact, with the reality that for years now we have seen more and more ham-handed interference with the global communications grid by the American alphabet soup (NSA, CIA, FBI, HoSec) and major tel-comms. Would the tel-comms and the American military and alphabet soup agencies collude on an operation that had as its aim to sabotage the Iranian communications network, even if that entailed collateral damage to other countries in the region? The honest answer has to be: sure, maybe so. Who can really tell? I mean, after all, we are living in a bizarro world now, a world of big and bigger lies, a world of 24/7 propaganda, a world of irrational and violent policies enacted against the civilian population by multinational corporations and military and espionage agencies the world over. We see the evidence for this on every hand. Only the most myopic among us remain oblivious to these realities.  

In light of the American Navy's demonstrated sea-floor capabilities and espionage activities, the heavy American Navy presence in the region, and the many veiled threats against Iran by both the Americans and the Israelis, suspicion naturally falls on them both. It may be that this is what the beginning of a war against Iran looks like. Or maybe we are merely seeing a dry run, a practice run, for a planned, upcoming war against Iran. The cables that have been cut are among the largest communication pipes in the region, and clearly represent major strategic targets.  

Whatever the case, it is crystal clear that we are not looking at business as usual. On the contrary, we are looking at distinctly unusual business, that much is obvious.  

The explanations being put forth in the mainstream news media for these several cut, undersea communications cables absolutely do not pass the smell test. And by the way, the same operators who cut undersea cables in the Persian Gulf, Mediterranean Sea and possibly the Suez as well, presumably can also cut underwater cables in the Gulf of Mexico or Great Lakes or ... you see my point. This could be a multipurpose operation, in part a test run for isolating a country from the international communications grid. Iran today, the USA tomorrow?  

What's that you say? I don't understand how the world works? That kind of thing can't happen here?  

In any event, if the cables have been intentionally cut, then that is an aggressive act of war. I'm sure the Iranians have gotten that message, and are actively making counter preparations against a possible imminent attack. I'm looking at the same telegram as they are, and I know I would be, were I in their shoes.","The article titled 'Middle East Undersea Cable Cutting A Zionist-NeoCon Covert Operation?' discusses multiple incidents of undersea cables being cut off the Egyptian coast and in the Persian Gulf.

With the recent wave of concern over Russian subs and spy ships encroaching on undersea data cables, Americans have become all too aware that the seemingly intangible data stored up in the ""cloud"" isn't nebulous at all. Rather, the mechanics of the internet are solid, taking form in cables that snake across the ocean floor.  

Though this may seem like a Cold War scare, the fears are new, report David E. Sanger and Eric Schmitt for The New York Times. Cutting the cables in the right places would sever the data lifeline of the West. The cables are so vulnerable that last year shark bites even prompted Google to reinforce their network.  

Amidst these tensions nags a different question: How does the internet actually work?  

In a new video, Phil Edwards and Gina Barton of Vox explore the network of thin, fiberoptic cables that distribute 99 percent of international data. ""If you held one in your hand, it’d be no bigger than a soda can,"" Edwards says in the video.  

Thin underwater cables hold the internet. See a map of them all.  

Submarine cables aren’t exactly new, but they are a big deal in the modern world. While satellites are needed to beam the Internet to some places, like remote research bases in Antarctica, cables on the seafloor are more reliable, redundant (good for backup in the case of damage) and fast.  

Tech companies and various countries are even investing in their own routes and connections. The telecommunications marketing researcher and consulting group TeleGeography reports that in 2015, 299 cable systems are ""active, under construction or expected to be fully-funded by the end of 2015.""  

In honor of all those cables, TeleGeography created a vintage-inspired map, which is well worth a gander. The map includes the latency, or the milliseconds of delay a ping takes to travel, from the U.S., U.K., Hong Kong and several other countries.  

So how did the more than 550,000 miles of cables get down there? Edwards explains at Vox:  

> The process for laying submarine cables hasn't changed much in 150 years—a ship traverses the ocean, slowly unspooling cable that sinks to the ocean floor. The **SS Great Eastern** laid the first continually successful trans-Atlantic cable in 1866, which was used to transmit telegraphs. Later cables (starting in 1956) carried telephone signals.  

The internet is also wired through cables that crisscross countries and someday in the future it might exist in hundreds of tiny satellites. But for now, it’s on the ocean floor.","The article ""Forget the Hazy Clouds—The Internet is in the Ocean"" discusses the critical infrastructure of the internet, specifically focusing on undersea cables.

MUMBAI: It was just a blip on the monitoring screens of a fortified room in Chennai, but a full-blown crisis 5,500 kilometres away, off the ancient city of Alexandria, Egypt. Last Wednesday, in the worldwide puppetry show called internet, a string had snapped. The Western world, with banks and factories and telephone networks to run, had just lost connection with its housekeeper and doorman, India. There was only one thing at stake: global business.

The potential danger from the two breaks in undersea cables in the Mediterranean was immense. Western businesses and customers depend on global connectivity to outsourced service providers such as India to run their daily affairs.

A disruption could have stranded them in a virtual no-man’s-land and India could have lost credibility as an always-on supplier of an ever-growing variety of services. Except that none of this happened. India and world can thank the design of the internet, Hydra-headed as it is, to this happy turn of events. Within a few milliseconds, life was back to normal, almost.

It was not by coincidence that the breakdown in SEA-ME-WE (South East Asia, Middle East, Western Europe) and FLAG (Fibre-optic Link Around the Globe) cables that carry the bulk of data and voice traffic from India to the West left only a limited impact for businesses. It was the combined effort of a dynamic disaster recovery technology and quick intervention by machine and humans that averted a catastrophe.

“IP (Internet Protocol) networks are the new generation technology to route any traffic through any route, any time. But for this resilience, the system would have collapsed with such a cable problem,” says Internet Service Providers Association of India president Rajesh Chharia. For high-value customers such as outsourcing companies, the rerouting gets done automatically by the systems at the ISP’s hub.

The major cables that knot India in the global web are SEA-ME-WE 3 and 4, FLAG, i2i (India to Island) and TIC (Tata Indicom Cable). Smaller, but important, systems are FALCON (FLAG Alcatel-Lucent Optical Network) to Saudi Arabia used by Reliance group and Bharat-Lanka Cable System to Colombo used by Bharat Sanchar Nigam. Hundreds of such cable systems criss-crossing the seabed form a mesh of bandwidth around the world.

The real sufferers during cable breaks are the individual internet users. Their connectivity is low priority for many ISPs who derive much of their profits from companies. The benefits of dynamic rerouting don’t come free. Large users pay a premium fee to make sure cable cuts don’t stop their traffic. For the small guy, a cable break could lead to disconnection or sluggish download speeds. Despite ISP claims, the small guy took a big knock during last week’s problems.

The twin cable breaks in the Mediterranean robbed India of about 1.4 terabits of bandwidth. This was less than 10% of what India could tap from its existing connections. Compare this with a similar cable break in December 2006, when an earthquake in Taiwan region, cut of 20 tbps. That time, thankfully, it was on the eastern side and the India’s traffic towards the US and Europe was not affected.

“I expect this incident to teach a lesson to our ISPs. They will all now rush to book capacity on other lines such as i2i. This will spur demand for the Pacific side cables,” Chharia says. “At the end of it, it was a close shave for India. When the whole world is looking to India, we couldn’t have let this shake our reliability.”

This article was originally published on [The Conversation](http://theconversation.com). Read the [original article](https://theconversation.com/in-our-wi-fi-world-the-internet-still-depends-on-undersea-cables-49936).

Recently a [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/world/europe/russian-presence-near-undersea-cables-concerns-us.html) on Russian submarine activity near undersea communications cables dredged up Cold War politics and generated widespread recognition of the submerged systems we all depend upon.

Not many people realize that undersea cables transport nearly [100% of transoceanic data traffic](https://books.google.com/books?id=LQDXAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA362&dq=submarine+telecommunications+cables&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBGoVChMI5Pm8_oPyyAIVBG4-Ch379Al9#v=onepage&q=99&f=false). These lines are laid on the very bottom of the ocean floor. They’re about as thick as a garden hose and carry the world’s internet, phone calls and even TV transmissions between continents at the speed of light. A single cable can carry tens of terabits of information per second.

While researching my book [The Undersea Network](https://www.dukeupress.edu/The-Undersea-Network), I realized that the cables we all rely on to send everything from email to banking information across the seas remain largely unregulated and undefended. Although they are laid by only a few companies (including the American company SubCom and the French company Alcatel-Lucent) and often funneled along narrow paths, the ocean’s vastness has often provided them protection.

**Far from wireless**

The fact that we route internet traffic through the ocean – amidst deep sea creatures and hydrothermal vents – runs counter to most people’s imaginings of the internet. Didn’t we develop satellites and Wi-Fi to transmit signals through the air? Haven’t we moved to the cloud? Undersea cable systems sound like a thing of the past.

The reality is that the cloud is actually under the ocean. Even though they might seem behind the times, fiber-optic cables are actually state-of-the-art global communications technologies. Since they use light to encode information and remain unfettered by weather, cables carry data faster and cheaper than satellites. They crisscross the continents too – a message from New York to California also travels by fiber-optic cable. These systems are not going to be replaced by aerial communications anytime soon.

**A vulnerable system?**

The biggest problem with cable systems is not technological – it’s human. Because they run underground, underwater and between telephone poles, cable systems populate the same spaces we do. As a result, we accidentally break them all the time. Local construction projects dig up terrestrial lines. Boaters drop anchors on cables. And submarines can pinpoint systems under the sea.

Most of the recent media coverage has been dominated by the question of vulnerability. Are global communications networks really at risk of disruption? What would happen if these cables were cut? Do we need to worry about the threat of sabotage from Russian subs or terrorist agents?

The answer to this is not black and white. Any individual cable is always at risk, but likely far more so from boaters and fishermen than any saboteur. Over history, the single largest cause of disruption has been people [unintentionally dropping anchors and nets](https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid=1&doctype=cite&docid=35+Tul.+Mar.+L.+J.+103&srctype=smi&srcid=3B15&key=643357ed57ae3d616915cb7b77c245f4). The [International Cable Protection Committee](https://www.iscpc.org) has been working for years to prevent such breaks.

As a result, cables today are covered in steel armor and buried beneath the seafloor at their shore-ends, where the human threat is most concentrated. This provides some level of protection. In the deep sea, the ocean’s inaccessibility largely safeguards cables – they need only to be covered with a thin polyethelene sheath. It’s not that it’s much more difficult to sever cables in the deep ocean, it’s just that the primary forms of interference are less likely to happen. The sea is so big and the cables are so narrow, the probability isn’t that high that you’d run across one.

Sabotage has actually been rare in the history of undersea cables. There are certainly occurrences (though none recently), but these are disproportionately publicized. The World War I [German raid of the Fanning Island cable station in the Pacific Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanning_Raid) gets a lot of attention. And there was [speculation about sabotage](http://www.economist.com/node/10653963) in the cable disruptions outside Alexandria, Egypt in 2008, which cut 70% of the country’s internet, affecting millions. Yet we hear little about the regular faults that occur, on average, [about 200 times each year](https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid=1&doctype=cite&docid=35+Tul.+Mar.+L.+J.+103&srctype=smi&srcid=3B15&key=643357ed57ae3d616915cb7b77c245f4).

**Redundancy provides some protection**

The fact is it’s incredibly difficult to monitor these lines. Cable companies have been trying to do so for more than a century, since the first telegraph lines were laid in the 1800s. But the ocean is too vast and the lines simply too long. It would be impossible to stop every vessel that came anywhere near critical communications cables. We’d need to create extremely long, “no-go” zones across the ocean, which itself would profoundly disrupt the economy.

[Fewer than 300 cable systems](http://submarinecablemap.com) transport almost all transoceanic traffic around the world. And these often run through narrow pressure points where small disruptions can have massive impacts. Since each cable can carry an extraordinary amount of information, it’s not uncommon for an entire country to rely on only a handful of systems. In many places, it would take only a few cable cuts to take out large swathes of the internet. If the right cables were disrupted at the right time, it could disrupt global internet traffic for weeks or even months.

The thing that protects global information traffic is the fact that there’s some redundancy built into the system. Since there is more cable capacity than there is traffic, when there is a break, information is automatically rerouted along other cables. Because there are many systems linking to the United States, and a lot of internet infrastructure is located here, a single cable outage is unlikely to cause any noticeable effect for Americans.

Any single cable line has been and will continue to be susceptible to disruption. And the only way around this is to build a more diverse system. But as things are, even though individual companies each look out for their own network, there is no economic incentive or supervisory body to ensure the global system as a whole is resilient. If there’s a vulnerability to worry about, this is it.

Fresh connectivity woes appear to have struck a segment of the aging SEA-ME-WE 3 submarine cable which leads to Australia. A repair job last month to fix damage that occurred in September was not satisfactorily completed, according to The Register.

Australian Internet service provider iiNet had advised customers over the weekend to expect an increase in latency when browsing international sites due to “a submarine cable fault impacting our international links between Perth and Singapore.” The notice promised an update in a week’s time, suggesting that it is not an issue that can be quickly rectified.

It’s not the first time that SEA-ME-WE 3 has run into problems. We reported late last year on how a cable fault in the section between Singapore and Indonesia caused similar slow Internet access for iiNet users.

At 39,000km, SEA-ME-WE 3 is the longest telecoms cable in the world, spanning from Germany to Australia and Japan, with some 39 landing stations in between.

Importantly, SEA-ME-WE 3 is the sole cable serving Perth from overseas at the moment. There are alternative network paths through Sydney to Hong Kong, but these introduces significant delays, increasing latency due to the circuitous route.

Errant ship anchor in shallower water and earthquakes are what typically causes damage to undersea cables. The segment of SEA-ME-WE 3 leading to Australia takes a route through Indonesia, which is a region known to experience hundreds of earthquake every year.

For now, the Submarine Cable Map service provided by TeleGeography pointed to several submarine cables currently under construction to link up the Singapore to Perth route. However, the earliest estimated availability for service date is in late 2016, so it’s at least another year before the reliance on SEA-ME-WE 3 can be alleviated.","The article discusses the SEA-ME-WE 3 submarine cable, detailing connectivity issues caused by damage to the cable.

HANOI (Vietnam News/Asia News Network): Vietnamese internet service providers have confirmed that four out of five submarine internet cables that connect the country to the world are experiencing issues, seriously affecting performance and reliability.

Two lines, the Asia-America Gateway (AAG) and Asia Pacific Gateway (APG), are completely offline at the moment, the Asia Africa Europe 1 (AAE-1) line is seeing disruptions towards the Hong Kong hub, while the Intra Asia (IA) line cable is seeing problems near the Singapore hub.

This is the first time such incidents have happened at the same time, and even more unfortunately, during the Lunar New Year holiday.

Many internet users have complained of slow and unreliable internet connections in recent times, ISPs have said.

Stressing that this was an unfortunate ‘force majeure’, a representative from Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group (VNPT) said the provider was actively deploying measures to ensure international internet connections to its consumers, including sharing data loads between still available international lines, working with Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube, as well as optimising traffic on different cables.

Thanks to these efforts, platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube can still be accessed normally, while financial, banking, and insurance transactions can still be conducted.

Mobile data connections are also ensured, according to a VNPT representative.

However, it stressed that with breakages occurring on four out of five undersea cables, internet access would suffer, especially in ‘peak hours’ with activities that demand large data like online games or watching movies, etc.

The military-run provider Viettel similarly has devised re-routing plans to regulate traffic on the remaining sea cable and land cables, and buy additional emergency capacity to ensure the best service quality for customers.

Major domestic service providers are actively working with submarine cable systems and ship operators to determine the cause of the issues, the location of the incident and the repair plan, in the shortest time possible.

Other smaller providers like CMC and NetNam are also making moves to mitigate the incident’s consequences like pushing more traffic onto land cables via China and Cambodia.","The article titled 'Internet slows as Vietnam submarine cables suffer unprecedented disruptions' discusses significant issues related to four out of five submarine internet cables connecting Vietnam to the world.

A rare weekend news briefing followed a confrontation in the South China Sea between a Vietnamese oil and gas survey ship and Chinese patrol boats.

Vietnam says the boats deliberately cut the survey ship's cables in Vietnamese waters. China denies the allegation.

China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan all claim territories in the South China Sea.

The area includes an important shipping route and is also thought to contain oil and gas deposits.

The spat comes just days before a regional security conference in Singapore.

Beijing said its defence minister would attend the IISS Asia Security Summit, the Shangri-La Dialogue, to promote co-operation and stability in the Asia Pacific region.

The latest clash involving Chinese patrol boats occurred 120km (80 miles) off the south-central coast of Vietnam and some 600km south of China's Hainan island.

""The Vietnamese navy will do everything necessary to firmly protect peace and the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Vietnam,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Nguyen Phuong Nga said.

One of three Chinese patrol vessels on the scene intentionally cut a submerged cable towed by the ship, the Binh Minh 02, said Do Van Hau, deputy chief executive of state oil and gas group PetroVietnam, which was operating the ship.

""Chinese vessels were at very high speed and did not respond to our ship's warning and then cut the cables of the Binh Minh 02, about 2km from where it was positioned,"" he said.

This frame grab from a YouTube video, which has garnered nearly 1 million views, shows a bluntnose sixgill shark biting a submarine cable.  

It may not be Shark Week, but don't tell that to people in Vietnam.  

Internet connections in the South East Asian nation have been affected by problems with the Asia America Gateway (AAG) submarine cable system for the fourth time in a year. The cause of the outages? Sharks, if you believe some online reports.  

As AAG has the highest capacity of cable systems linking to Vietnam, faults can have big consequences for its international Internet bandwidth.  

Vietnam's latest woes aren't the first time sharks have been made out to be a threat to the Internet. A 2010 YouTube video, showing a shark biting a submarine cable, made the rounds again, when a Google official said the search giant wraps its ocean cables in Kevlar to defend against sharks.  

With 99 percent of all transoceanic Internet traffic now flowing through submarine cables, how large of a threat are these big fish? Michael Costin, Chairman of the AAG Cable Consortium, says the damage was likely caused by ship anchors or fishing.  

""AAG is not yet aware of the cause of the advised fault, but strongly believes it is not caused by sharks,"" Costin said. ""Consistent with past experience, AAG believes it is most likely to be as a consequence of damage due to ship anchors or fishing, which reportedly are the predominant causes of faults experienced by submarine cables.""  

The fault occurred 117 kilometers off Vung Tau in the southern part of the country. Costin said the consortium's local partner is working with Vietnam's coast guard to protect the AAG cable.  

He points to research by the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC), which claims that 65 to 75 percent of cable faults are due to anchoring and fishing. It found no cable problems that were caused by sharks from 2008 to 2013, compared to 11 cases between 1959 and 2006.  

The ICPC says advances in cable design have ""effectively eliminated the problem."" Modern cables wrap a core of optical fibers in multiple protective layers.  

As for shark bites, it's like a joke within this industry. Shota Masuda, a senior manager in NEC's Submarine Network Division, said via email, ""Google made a remark last year about this, and this brought back a few papers written about this topic into the light, but in reality, sharks do not bite fiber optic submarine cables.""  

Biologists, meanwhile, say sharks are known to bite submarine cables, but how much damage they can cause depends on the species and the cable itself.

**By Anna Gross and Alexandra Heal, Financial Times**  
February 10, 2023

China has cut its participation in an internet cable project to link Asia with Europe, as tensions grow between Washington and Beijing over control of the physical infrastructure that transmits the world’s online traffic.

Two of China’s biggest telecoms groups, China Telecom and China Mobile, withdrew their combined investment of roughly 20 per cent from the subsea cable project last year after a US company was selected to build the line over Hengtong Marine, the country’s biggest provider in the sector, according to three people briefed on the decision.

Their exit from the Sea-Me-We 6 pipeline — which is estimated to cost around $500mn to lay 19,200km of cables connecting south-east Asia to western Europe — highlights the growing battle between China and the US over who builds and owns the infrastructure underpinning the global internet.

The departure of China Mobile and China Telecom is an indication of intensifying tensions between Washington and Beijing, according to industry figures with knowledge of the project. Another member of the consortium described their involvement as “important but not critical”.

China Unicom, a much smaller state-owned company, has remained involved with an unspecified investment in the project, which is expected to complete in 2025.

Since 2020, the US has denied permission for several subsea telecoms cables that involved Chinese companies or directly connected the US to mainland China or Hong Kong, citing national security concerns.

The strained Sino-US relationship is reshaping the global technology sector, as companies and countries are forced to respond to the pressure exerted by the two economic powerhouses.

Last October, Washington unveiled tough export controls to prevent China obtaining advanced chips or securing the technology and equipment to make high-end semiconductors domestically.

The Sea-Me-We 6 consortium, which includes Microsoft, Orange and Telecom Egypt, opted for US company SubCom to build the line rather than the bid from Hengtong Marine — prompting the two Chinese state-owned groups to exit.","The article 'China Pulls Back From SEA-ME-WE 6' discusses China's withdrawal from the SEA-ME-WE 6 subsea cable project, which is a significant undersea cable initiative.

"Visual Insights into Underwater Internet Cables","97% of intercontinental data relies on underwater cables, with at least 50 breaks annually in the Atlantic highlighting their vulnerabilities.","https://www.sciencealert.com/these-rarely-seen-images-show-what-the-internet-actually-looks-like","2018-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","Business Insider",Yes,"Business Insider","New York, New York, USA","500000","2018-06-10","English","Business Insider","Every second, millions of emails, clicks, and searches happen via the world wide web with such fluidity that the internet seems almost omnipresent.

As such, people often mistakenly assume that internet traffic happens by air – our mobile devices, after all, aren't wired to anything.

But satellites carry less than 1 percent of human interactions, and in some ways the truth is far more impressive than messages sent by tower signal.

The internet – arguably the most important resource in the modern world – is very tangible and fairly vulnerable. It exists in large part under our feet, by way of an intricate system of rope-thin underwater and underground cables hooked to giant data storage units so powerful, they're capable of recalling any piece of information at a moment's notice.

Here's what the infrastructure of the internet actually looks like today:

**In the most basic sense, the internet's job is to carry information from point A to point B.**

Those points are IP addresses – the unique codes that identify locations around the world – and they're what your devices are linked to when you're connected to the internet. Curious what yours is? If you type ""My IP address"" into Google, the search engine will bring it up.

**As it travels, any information transferred over the web arrives at internet data servers, which live in data centres around the world. In 2008, an estimated 9.5 trillion gigabytes passed in and out of the world's servers.**

**Moving information to and from servers often involves crossing oceans. We rely almost entirely on cables for internet traffic because they're faster and cheaper than satellites, but laying them across bodies of water is a tedious process that's taken almost 200 years and requires a lot of maintenance.**

**To get the internet to what it is today, humans have slowly laid over 300 underwater cables that run a total of 550,000 miles.**

About 97 percent of all intercontinental data is transferred through these cables, according to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.

**If the world's underwater cables were laid out end-to-end, the cables could extend from here to the moon and back again, and then wrap around the earth's widest point almost three times.**

**The longest cable is about 24,000 miles long. It extends from Germany to Korea and even further south to Australia, hitting 39 different landing points along the way.**

The first transcontinental cable was laid down in 1858, and ran from Ireland to Newfoundland.

**There are a few different types of cables used underwater, ranging in thickness from a garden hose to about three inches in diameter. The lightest are laid primarily in the deep ocean floor.**

At the heart of the cables are the fibre optic wires that transmit information, protected by water-resistant petroleum jelly and layers of stranded metal.

**Laying each cable down requires several months, millions of dollars, and a very large ship with miles of cable coiled up onboard.**

**Some cables are laid as deep as 25,000 feet below the surface of the ocean, meaning they're subject to damage from natural disasters, corrosion, fishers, and even shark bites.**

**Break repairs are handled by special ships with small hooks that pull the cable up or cut it in two and bring both halves up for mending. At least 50 cable breaks a year happen in the Atlantic alone, according to MIT Tech Review.**

**The cables come back to shore at cable landing points and make their way to data centres by travelling underground. Maintenance and planning for underground cables is easier than underwater cables in some ways but still challenging in other ways.**

**In the US, there are 542 cables connecting at 273 different points.**

The first publicly available map of the US's cable network wasn't available until 2015. It took Paul Barford and his team of researchers almost four years to pull it together.

**The ecosystem of cables depends largely on the country's infrastructure. In the US, for example, most of the long-haul cables are located along major roads and railways.**

**For cables under dry land, construction is a big concern. To prevent the cables from being dug up, they're laid alongside gas pipes or inside old pipelines, with aboveground markers along the way.**

**Similar to underwater cables, cables in dry ground are subject to damage from natural disasters, like earthquakes.**

**The cables eventually reach the aforementioned data centres, and navigate to the machine servers.**

**These are typically unmarked buildings located in both rural areas far outside of city limits and in buildings within highly populated cities, hidden in plain sight.**

**In fact, one of the world's most concentrated hubs in terms of internet connectivity is located in lower Manhattan at 60 Hudson Street.**

A company called Telx operates out of the 9th floor, where local, national, and global channels come together to transmit data.

**And there are two other major hubs in New York, located at 111 Eighth Avenue and 32 Avenue of the Americas.**

**Each data center consumes massive amounts of energy. Apple recently built two solar energy installations to help power its North Carolina data center, which requires 20 megawatts of power at full capacity.**

**They're filled with ""deafeningly noisy rooms cocooning racks of servers and routers,"" where you're ""buffeted by hot and cold air that blusters through everything,"" according to designer and artist Timo Arnall.**

**If that doesn't sound like a place you want to spend your time, keep in mind that you don't really have a choice: data centres are very difficult to get into.**

**From the outside, these unassuming buildings serve as the most glaring proof we have that the internet is more physical than we think.**

**A constant aboveground reminder of everything it takes to keep the world wide web afloat.**

Damage to fibre-optic cables from the Japan earthquake highlights the vulnerability of Australia's international communication links, says one expert.

Two cables linking Japan and the United States were damaged following the 9.0 magnitude earthquake, causing a 30 percent slowing of bandwidth. The damage may take a month to repair.

While Australia's communication system wasn't affected by the Japan quake, it is extremely vulnerable to natural disasters, says Professor James Goff, of the University of New South Wales in Sydney.

""We were very lucky from this particular instance in Japan that no more cables were broken,"" says Goff, director of the Australian Tsunami Research Centre and Natural Hazards Research Laboratory.

Australia is heavily dependent upon a network of fibre-optic cables that cross the Pacific Ocean carrying to 99 percent of Australia's voice and data traffic. 

Around 70 percent of this traffic flows through Hawaii, the rest flows through other 'choke points' in Indonesia and Guam - all of which are subject to major natural events, says Goff.

""We are surrounded in the Pacific by the Ring of Fire and these [cables] go across it. So there is an element of concern about how exposed we are,"" says Goff, adding that much of the infrastructure is old and difficult to replace.

""Tens of billions of dollars of our economy is pumped through these things. If you ... slow it down by 20 percent how many billions of dollars does that represent to our economy?""

**Previous warning**

Two years ago Goff warned, in a paper published in Natural Hazards Earth Systems Science, that Australia has very little understanding about how natural events can affect the major bottlenecks located in unstable regions such as Hawaii, and called for urgent research into the risks to telecommunications.

""This is going to become an increasing problem,"" he says. ""We are putting more and more traffic down more and more cables and putting more and more cables underground.""

Even a minor disruption could have huge impacts, he warns. For example, the 2006 Taiwan earthquake damaged several underwater fibre-optic cables and slowed down Australia's communication system for two months.

""It's the classic case of 'let's not do anything about it because we haven't had a serious problem yet' but when a serious problem comes along, what are we going to do about it then?"" asks Goff.

He has renewed his calls for more research into the threats posed to the network across the Pacific.

""We need to go out and find out what the hell is happening in Hawaii, what the hell is happening in Indonesia to try to find out the implications it has for us,"" says Goff.","The article discusses the impact of the 2011 Japan earthquake on undersea communication cables, highlighting damage to fibre-optic cables that caused significant internet bandwidth slowdowns.

A deep dive into Internet infrastructure, plus a rare visit to a subsea cable landing site.

**The secret world of cable landing sites**

BT might be teasing its customers with the promise of fibre to the home (FTTH) to boost bandwidth, and Virgin Media has a pretty decent service, offering speeds of up to 200Mbps for domestic users on its hybrid fibre-coaxial (HFC) network. But as it says on the tin, the _World_ Wide Web is a global network. Providing an Internet service goes beyond the mere capabilities of a single ISP on this sceptred isle or, indeed, the capabilities of any single ISP anywhere in the world.

First we’re going to take a rare look at one of the most unusual and interesting strands of the Internet and how it arrives onshore in Britain. We’re not talking dark fibre between terrestrial data centres 50 miles apart, but the landing station where Tata’s Atlantic submarine cable terminates at a mysterious location on the west coast of England after its 6,500km journey from New Jersey in the USA.

Connecting to the US is critical for any serious international communications company, and Tata’s Global Network (TGN) is the only wholly owned fibre ring encircling the planet. It amounts to a 700,000km subsea and terrestrial network with more than 400 points of presence worldwide.

Tata is willing to share, though; it’s not just there so the CEO’s kids get the best latency when playing _Call of Duty_, and the better half can stream _Game of Thrones_ without a hitch. At any one time Tata’s Tier 1 network is handling 24 percent of the world’s Internet traffic, so the chance to get up close and personal with TGN-A (Atlantic), TGN-WER (Western Europe), and their cable consortium friends is not to be missed.

The site itself is a pretty much vanilla data centre from the outside, appearing grey and anonymous—they could be crating cabbages in there for all you’d know. Inside, it’s RFID cards to move around the building and fingerprint readers to access the data centre areas, but first a cuppa and a chat in the boardroom. This isn’t your typical data centre, and some aspects need explaining. In particular, submarine cable systems have extraordinary power requirements, all supported by extensive backup facilities.

### Armoured submarine cables

Carl Osborne, Tata’s VP of international network development, joined us to add his insights during the tour. When it comes to Tata’s submarine cable network, he has actually been on board the cable ship to watch it all happen. He brought with him some subsea cable samples to show how the design changes depending on the depth. The nearer to the surface you get, the more protection—armour—you need to withstand potential disturbances from shipping. Trenches are dug and cables buried in shallow waters coming up onto shore. At greater depths, though, areas such as the West European Basin, which is almost three miles from the surface, there’s no need for armour, as merchant shipping poses no threat at all to cables on the seabed.

At these depths, cable diameter is just 17mm, akin to a marker pen encased by a thick polyethylene insulating sheath. A copper conductor surrounds multiple strands of steel wire that protect the optical fibres at the core, which are inside a steel tube less than 3mm in diameter and cushioned in thixotropic jelly. Armoured cables have the same arrangement internally but are clad with one or more layers of galvanised steel wire, which is wrapped around the entire cable.

Without the copper conductor, you wouldn’t have a subsea cable. Fibre-optic technology is fast and seemingly capable of unlimited bandwidth, but it can’t cover long distances without a little help. Repeaters—effectively signal amplifiers—are required to boost the light transmission over the length of the fibre optic cable. This is easily achieved on land with local power, but on the ocean bed the amplifiers receive a DC voltage from the cable’s copper conductor. And where does that power come from? The cable landing sites at either end of the cable.

Although the customers wouldn’t know it, TGN-A is actually two cables that take diverse paths to straddle the Atlantic. If one cable goes down, the other is there to ensure continuity. The alternative TGN-A lands at a different site some 70 miles (and three terrestrial amplifiers) away and receives its power from there, too. One of these transatlantic subsea cables has 148 amplifiers, while the other slightly longer route requires 149.

Site managers tend not to seek out the limelight, so we’ll call our cable landing site tour guide John, who explains more about this configuration.

“To power the cable from this end, we’ve a positive voltage and in New Jersey there’s a negative voltage on the cable. We try and maintain the current—the voltage is free to find the resistance of the cable. It’s about 9,000V, and we share the voltage between the two ends. It’s called a dual-end feed, so we’re on about 4,500V each end. In normal conditions we could power the cable from here to New Jersey without any support from the US.”

Needless to say, the amplifiers are designed to be maintenance-free for 25 years, as you’re not going to be sending divers down to change a fuse. Yet looking at the cable sample itself, with a mere eight strands of optical fibre inside, you can’t help but think that, for all the effort involved, there should be more.

“The limitations are on the size of the amplifier. For eight fibre pairs you’d need twice the size of amplifier,” says John, and as the amplifier scales up, so does the need for power.

At the landing site, the eight fibres that make up TGN-A exist as four pairs, each pair comprising a distinct send and receive fibre. The individual fibre strands are coloured, such that if it’s broken, and a repair needs to be done at sea, the technicians know how to splice it back together again. Similarly, those on land can identify what goes where when plugging into the Submarine Line Terminal Equipment (SLTE).

### Fixing cables at sea

After the landing site trip, I spoke to Peter Jamieson, a fibre network support specialist at Virgin Media, for a few more details on submarine cable maintenance. “Once the cable has been found and returned to the cable-repair ship, a new piece of undamaged cable is attached. The ROV [remotely operated vehicle] then returns to the seabed, finds the other end of the cable and makes the second join. It then uses a high-pressure water jet to bury the cable up to 1.5 metres under the seabed,” he says.

“Repairs normally take around 10 days from the moment the cable repair ship is launched, with four to five days spent at the location of the break. Fortunately, such incidents are rare: Virgin Media has only had to deal with two in the past seven years.","The article discusses submarine cables extensively, including their construction, maintenance, and the implications of damage.

**NAIROBI, April 16 (Reuters)** - Foreign navies have agreed to protect a vessel installing an undersea high-speed Internet cable from pirates off the coast of Somalia, a Kenyan minister said on Thursday.

Sea gangs from lawless Somalia have been increasingly striking the Indian Ocean shipping lanes and strategic Gulf of Aden, capturing dozens of vessels and hundreds of hostages in attacks that have driven up insurance rates.

Patrols by Western navies have done little to deter the attacks.

Kenyan Information and Communications Minister Samuel Poghisio said the 5,000 km (3,107 miles) fibre optic cable was on course for completion in June.

Last month, a government official said the route for the East African Marine Cable (TEAMS) had been shifted an extra 200 km from the coastline for fear of pirates.

""These are concerns we have but they are being addressed. We know it will be secure and will land in Mombasa on time,"" Poghisio said in a statement on Thursday.

""The process (of laying the cable) has begun and will probably take two months. It is likely that by the middle of June the ship should be anchoring in Mombasa, or rather delivering the cable to Mombasa,"" he added.

The $130 million cable will link Kenya's coastal town of Mombasa with Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates.

Kenya has been putting down a terrestrial cable connecting different parts of the country to prepare for the arrival of the marine cable, which could be east Africa's first speedy but cheap telecoms link with the rest of the world.

Another undersea project known as SEACOM is also expected to be operational in the second half of 2009 and two others are due to land in 2010 -- the Eastern African Submarine Cable System (EASSy) and the France Telecom/Orange Sat3-wasc-Safe cable.

Ha spoke on the situation of repairs in the Luzon Straits of telecommunication cables which are undergoing repair after an earthquake off Taiwan 26 December caused severe disruptions to digital telecommunications in the region.

Hong Kong telecom authorities assumed emergency powers Tuesday as firms faced Internet disruption on the first day back to work after an earthquake damaged regional undersea data cables. Telecom and Internet service providers sent the city's telecom authority OFTA hourly updates on service capacity as repair ships struggled to mend fibre optic cables severed in the Boxing Day quake off Taiwan.

""We put the emergency response system in place this morning as this was the first day that businesses and schools resumed operations after the Christmas and New Year holidays,"" said Ha Yung-kuen, OFTA's acting director general of telecommunications.

OFTA had received only 20 inquiries from Internet users by mid-morning, suggesting that services had not been hit as hard as had been feared. By the close of business OFTA said traffic had moved smoothly and there had been no reports of serious congestion.

""The situation is better than we expected,"" Ha said, adding that Internet service providers had rerouted much of their traffic through land links with China and via satellite networks.

Ha said international phone calls, mobile services and fax lines were back to normal a week after the Boxing Day temblor ripped through submarine data cables in the Taiwan Straits. The cables carry most of the region's digital traffic. All but one of the seven submarine links, which carry international data in and out of Hong Kong, snapped and Internet capacity was down to 70 percent.

""Service operators have said they will give priority to companies during business hours, so that means personal users will experience some delays,"" Ha said. He added that smaller companies depending on bought-in Internet services rather than their own networks would suffer most. He urged surfers to avoid accessing large overseas-based Web pages to conserve capacity.

It may not be Shark Week, but don't tell that to people in Vietnam.

Internet connections in the South East Asian nation have been affected by problems with the Asia America Gateway (AAG) submarine cable system for the fourth time in a year. The cause of the outages? Sharks, if you believe some online reports.

As AAG has the highest capacity of cable systems linking to Vietnam, faults can have big consequences for its international Internet bandwidth.

Vietnam's latest woes aren't the first time sharks have been made out to be a threat to the Internet. Last year, a 2010 YouTube video, showing a shark biting a submarine cable, made the rounds again, when a Google official said the search giant wraps its ocean cables in Kevlar to defend against sharks.

With 99 percent of all transoceanic Internet traffic now flowing through submarine cables, how large of a threat are these big fish? Michael Costin, Chairman of the AAG Cable Consortium, says the damage was likely caused by ship anchors or fishing.

""AAG is not yet aware of the cause of the advised fault, but strongly believes it is not caused by sharks,"" Costin said. ""Consistent with past experience, AAG believes it is most likely to be as a consequence of damage due to ship anchors or fishing.""

The fault occurred 117 kilometers off Vung Tau in the southern part of the country. Costin said the consortium's local partner is working with Vietnam's coast guard to protect the AAG cable.

Research by the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) claims that 65 to 75 percent of cable faults are due to anchoring and fishing. It found no cable problems caused by sharks from 2008 to 2013, compared to 11 cases between 1959 and 2006.

Modern cables wrap a core of optical fibers in multiple protective layers, including a copper or aluminum tube and fiberglass or plastic shell. Cables laid near shore or fishing grounds are often equipped with an additional shield of steel wires and buried.

""As for shark bites, it's like a joke within this industry,"" Shota Masuda, a senior manager in NEC's Submarine Network Division, said. ""In reality, sharks do not bite fiber optic submarine cables.""

NEC manufactured cables used in the AAG system. Masuda says that the AAG Consortium is responsible for maintaining the link but that cables can get cut by dropped anchors, trawler nets, and undersea earthquakes.

Biologists say sharks are known to bite submarine cables, but the extent of damage depends on the species and the cable itself. 

""Underwater cables are sometimes bitten and damaged by sharks,"" Kazuhiro Nakaya, a marine scientist, said. ""Although 8,000m below sea level is a little too deep for sharks, it is possible that cables in shallower areas are damaged by sharks.""

Sharks are attracted by electromagnetic fields they can detect through sensing organs. 

Dean Grubbs, a marine scientist, said he has seen experiments showing sharks orienting to weak electromagnetic fields. However, most deep-sea sharks have relatively weak jaws, suggesting that human activity is what has been affecting the Internet in Vietnam. According to Costin, anchoring and fishing were responsible for all the faults last year. 

It's expected to be fully restored by Jan. 27.","The article discusses the Asia America Gateway (AAG) submarine cable system, highlighting problems with internet connectivity in Vietnam due to faults in this undersea cable.

East Asia is in the middle of an Internet traffic jam as engineers fix a cut in one of the region’s significant submarine cables.

The Flag North Asian Loop/ Reach North Asian Loop submarine cable, which links Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, was cut around 10 August.

Details of the cut are unknown except that it has been located and engineers have been deployed to fix it “hopefully” by the end of this week.

**Update:** The break was caused by Typhoon Soudelor, the most intense tropical cyclone to develop in the Northern Hemisphere in 2015.

Telstra International operates the RNAL cable and has provided an update stating that despite the difficult weather conditions, repairs are progressing well.

HKIX manager, Che-Hoo Cheng, says the cut has decreased traffic routing through HKIX by around 10%. ""Because of the cut, this traffic is being routed through longer, more congested pathways.""

Submarine cable cuts are not uncommon for the region. Earlier this year, the Asia-America Gateway submarine cable system was cut in January and April.

More and more submarine cables are being rolled out each year. They are preferred over satellite connections because they allow for higher speed connection and lower latency. 

The total carrying capacity of submarine cable between the USA and East Asia is in the terabits per second, while satellites typically offer only 1000 megabits per second.","The article discusses a significant incident involving a cut submarine cable in East Asia, specifically mentioning that engineers are fixing a cut in the Flag North Asian Loop/Reach North Asian Loop submarine cable.

It details the impact of the cut on internet traffic, noting a decrease in routing through the Hong Kong Internet Exchange (HKIX) by approximately 10%.

The article also explains that the cut was caused by Typhoon Soudelor and highlights the broader implications for internet connectivity in the region.

"The Secret Life of the 500+ Cables That Run the Internet","Explores the impact of subsea cable severance on internet connectivity, detailing specific outages and vulnerabilities affecting global performance.","https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/features/the-secret-life-of-the-500-cables-that-run-the-internet","2023-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","Stephen Shankland",Yes,"Stephen Shankland","San Francisco, California, USA",-,"2023-08-06","English","CNET","Laced across the cold depths of the world's oceans is a network of multimillion-dollar cables, which have become the vital connections of our online lives.

The concert is in London. You're watching it live from your home in Atlanta. What makes that possible is a network of subsea cables draped across the cold, dark contours of the ocean floor, transmitting sights and sounds at the speed of light through strands of glass fiber as thin as your hair but thousands of miles long.

These cables, only about as thick as a garden hose, are high-tech marvels. The fastest, the newly completed transatlantic cable called Amitié and funded by Microsoft, Meta and others, can carry 400 terabits of data per second. That's 400,000 times faster than your home broadband if you're lucky enough to have high-end gigabit service.

And yet subsea cables are low-tech, too, coated in tar and unspooled by ships employing basically the same process used in the 1850s to lay the first transatlantic telegraph cable. SubCom, a subsea-cable maker based in New Jersey, evolved from a rope manufacturer with a factory next to a deep-water port for easy loading onto ships.

Though satellite links are becoming more important with orbiting systems like SpaceX's Starlink, subsea cables are the workhorses of global commerce and communications, carrying more than 99% of traffic between continents. TeleGeography, an analyst firm that tracks the business, knows of 552 existing and planned subsea cables, and more are on the way as the internet spreads to every part of the globe and every corner of our lives.

You probably know that tech giants like Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google run the brains of the internet. They're called ""hyperscalers"" for operating hundreds of data centers packed with millions of servers. You might not know that they also increasingly run the internet's nervous system, too.

""The whole network of undersea cables is the lifeblood of the economy,"" said Alan Mauldin, an analyst with TeleGeography. ""It's how we're sending emails and phone calls and YouTube videos and financial transactions.""

Two thirds of traffic comes from the hyperscalers, according to Telegeography. And the data demands of hyperscalers' subsea cable is surging 45% to 60% per year, said SubCom Chief Executive David Coughlan. ""Their underlying growth is fairly spectacular,"" he said.

Hyperscalers' data demands are driven not just by their own content needs, like Instagram photos and YouTube videos viewed around the world. These companies also often operate the cloud computing businesses, like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, that underlie millions of businesses' global operations.

""As the world's hunger for content continues to increase, you need to have the infrastructure in place to be able to serve that,"" said Brian Quigley, who oversees Google's subsea and terrestrial networks.

The first subsea cables spanned major communication routes like London to New York. Those remain critical, but newer routes are bringing bandwidth far off the beaten track: the west coast of Greenland, the volcanic island of St. Helena west of Africa, the southern tip of Chile, Pacific island nations, the 8,000-person town of Sitka, Alaska.

It's all part of a gradual transformation of subsea communications. Where once cables were the exception, linking a few high-priority urban centers, now they're becoming a world-spanning mesh. In other words, despite high costs and exotic technology, subsea cables are coming to resemble the rest of the internet.

But as more internet traffic traverses subsea cables, there's also reason to worry about them. The explosive sabotage last year of the Nordstream 1 and 2 natural gas pipelines connecting Russia and Europe was much more logistically difficult than cutting an internet cable the thickness of your thumb. An ally of Russian leader Vladimir Putin said subsea cables are fair game for attack. Taiwan has 27 subsea cable connections that the Chinese military could see as tempting targets in an attack.

The risks are vivid: Vietnam's internet performance suffered thanks to outages on all five of its cables for months earlier this year, and the volcanic explosion on the island of Tonga severed it from most communications for weeks.

But those risks are dwarfed by the very real benefits, from the macroeconomic to the purely personal. The network is growing more reliable and capable with faster speeds and a surge in new cables extending the network beyond today's 870,000 miles of routes, and that'll coax more and more countries to join.

That makes the internet richer and more resilient for all of us — including you getting work done and finding entertainment after the workday's over.","The article discusses subsea cables extensively, including the implications of cable severance and specific incidents affecting internet connectivity.

It mentions the ease of cutting a subsea cable and provides examples of how outages on these cables impact internet performance, such as in Vietnam.

In today’s interconnected world, the global flow of information relies heavily on an intricate network of underwater internet or submarine cables that crisscross the world’s oceans. These underwater internet cables, often invisible to the naked eye, facilitate data transmission, enabling internet connectivity, telecommunications, and international trade. The geopolitical implications surrounding these underwater infrastructure systems have become a focal point in discussions of national security, economic influence, and international relations.

**Submarine cables: The unsung heroes of global communication**  
When we think of global communications, we often think of satellites, those high-tech marvels orbiting the Earth. But in reality, most of the world’s telecommunications traffic travels through a network of underwater cables, each about the size of a garden hose.  
These cables carry an estimated 99% of all international data traffic, including our video calls, stock market transactions, and even military communications. They are the backbone of our interconnected world, making it possible to communicate instantly with people across the globe.

**The geopolitical significance of underwater internet cables**  
Underwater cables hold immense strategic and economic value, making them a focal point of interest for nations worldwide. Their construction costs, reaching hundreds of millions of dollars, are outweighed by their unparalleled efficiency compared to satellite alternatives. However, the geopolitical implications surrounding these cables are substantial.

**Undersea cable battle: U.S. vs. China**  
The United States and China are battling to control the undersea cables that carry most of the world’s internet traffic. The U.S. government is concerned about the potential for the Chinese spying on these cables and has been working to prevent Chinese companies from building them.  
In one recent example, the U.S. government successfully intervened to prevent a Chinese company from building a cable connecting Singapore to France. The U.S. government did this by incentivising the consortium of companies funding the cable to choose an American company instead.  
The U.S. government’s actions are part of a wider effort to rein in China’s growing influence in the technology sector. The U.S. government is concerned that China is using its technological prowess to gain a strategic advantage over the United States.

**The risk of espionage and sabotage**  
Underwater cables are not only susceptible to geopolitical tensions but are also vulnerable to espionage and sabotage. Governments and intelligence agencies have been known to tap into these cables to intercept sensitive communications. Additionally, cables have been deliberately damaged, disrupting communications and potentially causing economic and security risks.","The article titled 'The Geopolitical Significance of Submarine Cables in Modern Communication Networks' discusses the importance and vulnerability of submarine cables extensively.

Reporter: Sir, at this point, what additional measures have the relevant agencies taken to completely stop the theft of undersea fiber optic cables?

- Deputy Minister Le Nam Thang: The Prime Minister Nguyen Sinh Hung has requested various sectors and localities to strengthen this task. However, due to a lack of awareness, on May 22 and 23, several tons of cables were still stolen. Recently, on May 29, a theft of 100 tons of cables was discovered. The Singapore telecommunications company (Singtel) that has an undersea cable running through Vietnam reported that 32 km of its cable has been cut. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (BC-VT) has reported this complex situation to the government for decisive direction to ban all acts of exploiting undersea cables and to enhance monitoring and inspection of cable lines, strictly dealing with theft and consumption of fiber optic cables.

To effectively prevent this, this week, two deputy ministers of the BC-VT will directly visit coastal provinces from Da Nang to Ca Mau, urging provinces to enhance public awareness of the harms of cable theft. Additionally, the BC-VT has sent cable route maps to relevant authorities for monitoring and protection measures. Currently, besides the two fiber optic routes TVH and SMW-3 of VNPT, there are seven other foreign undersea cable routes running through Vietnam's continental shelf: APCN, APCN2, APC, EAC, EAC2, C2C, Flag.

**Is it too late for the company to build the third cable route (AGG)?**

- This is very difficult; an undersea fiber optic cable requires an investment of several hundred million USD, so a company cannot do it alone and must collaborate with partners from other countries. Moreover, undersea cables connect one country to another, so cooperation is mandatory. A minimum of several countries must collaborate, sometimes even a dozen countries contribute to the construction.

**Can the damage from the stolen fiber optic cables be accurately estimated?**

- It is not possible to accurately quantify the damage yet, but it amounts to millions of USD. If communication is disrupted, Vietnam could be isolated in terms of information when the fiber optic cable is cut, leading to immeasurable and significant damage. Meanwhile, the public does not understand that fiber optic cables are expensive to purchase from abroad, but when sold as scrap, they are worth very little, as only the steel outer casing can be sold, while the core is just glass fibers.

**How long will it take to restore the TVH line and what is the repair cost?**

- According to reports from the International Telecommunications Company (VTI), about 100 km of the TVH fiber optic cable has been stolen, so it will take at least 3 months to restore the line. Once VTI has an agreement with the cable repair company, we will request relevant authorities to permit vessels to operate as quickly as possible. However, this needs to be done soon as the rainy season is approaching.

**Stealing undersea fiber optic cables could lead to the death penalty**

On May 30, the Government Office worked with the BC-VT regarding the cable incident on the TVH line. Pham Hong Hai, Director of the Telecommunications Department, BC-VT, stated that after the meeting, the Prime Minister will issue a directive requiring all relevant ministries and coastal localities to strictly prohibit any acts of exploiting undersea cables. At the same time, it is essential to enhance safety measures and raise public awareness about the importance of undersea fiber optic cables for national security. According to Mr. Hai, based on the Penal Code, the act of stealing fiber optic cables can result in imprisonment from 3 years to the death penalty.","The article 'Lại thêm 100 tấn cáp quang biển bị cắt trộm' discusses multiple instances of undersea cables being cut, including specific incidents of theft involving 100 tons of cables.

The magnitude 9 earthquake which struck off the coast of Japan two weeks ago caused widespread destruction which has yet to be assessed properly. The tsunami which followed washed away entire towns and displaced hundreds of thousands of people. The death toll has risen to nearly 10,000 but there is at least another 13,000 missing and unaccounted for. Meanwhile engineers are battling to make safe the Fukushima nuclear reactor which was severely damaged and issued radioactive material over a large part of Japan, the risks of which are still being established. But the damage went beyond the shores of Japan with undersea telecommunications cables being severed.

The Internet is, by its very structure, fairly robust and routes traffic through different nodes should others fail. But much of the infrastructure is old and when major lines go down other parts of the system cannot cope with the extra traffic. It has meant that many parts of Asia have seen extremely slow Internet connection over the past two weeks.

**Internet disruption**  
In Beijing and other cities across China many people began to see slow connections a few days after the quake. But the connection was not immediately made to the disaster which struck Japan. Chinese authorities often restrict the Internet, slowing traffic and blocking websites, so a reduction in the speed of the Internet was seen by some as a reaction to recent calls for a so-called Jasmine Revolution in China.

Internet services within China seemed to be less affected, but accessing websites based outside the country were fast becoming extremely unreliable. Expats in particular were beginning to notice problems. Comments on Twitter began to appear with users becoming exasperated. ""Chinese Internet is slow like molasses in Alaska. Worried that I'll not even get a radio feed for tomorrow's Timbers FC match,"" one Twitter user observed around a week after the quake. With apparent blocks of GMail by the Chinese government, most people assumed that the slow Internet was due to government action. Using a VPN, which directs traffic to foreign servers, did not help. VPNs have been targeted by Chinese authorities and so this was also assumed to be a cause of the problem. But it has gradually become clear that the slow Internet has more to do with damage to undersea cables.

**Repairs underway**  
There have been relatively few reports concerning the damage inflicted on the Internet by the earthquake. But on Thursday 24th March The Shanghai Daily reported that the problems seen over the last two weeks were due, at least in part, by the damage done to telecommunications cables. The paper said it may take up to 45 days for services to return to normal however.

A joint repair operation is under way to fix submarine cables a Chinese cable company said. The team consisting of a repair ship carrying 50 Chinese and foreign technicians left Shanghai port on Thursday for waters near Taiwan. They will attempt to reconnect three of a dozen cables on the seafloor using a robot. Other damaged cables will be repaired at the same time by teams from South Korea and Japan.

The repair work has been delayed due to concerns over aftershocks, the cable company said. China's telecommunication authority said only a small number of users on the mainland were still affected by the damage. But the experience described by many users across China tells a different story.

According to the KDDI, a Japanese telecommunications firm, the operation to reconnect the cables will not be straightforward. Robots capable of diving to 2,500m have been deployed in order to fix the cables but it might take months to complete. Robots have never been used for repairing cables before, only deploying them, so the challenge is much greater.

**Extensive damage**  
It is thought that over 150,000 circuits are currently offline, and mobile networks have also suffered in these cuts. Pacnet, a Hong Kong-based cable-network operator, estimates about half the cables running across the Pacific are damaged thus affecting connections to the US. Because of redundancy that has been put in place, connectivity is possible but in a degraded state which for many means a much slower connection.

Many telecom operators and users were reporting some disruptions to the Internet as early as Monday 14th March. Partial restoration of services was accomplished by re-routing traffic over undamaged cables and via satellites.

About half of the existing cables running across the Pacific are damaged and ""a lot of people are feeling a little bit of slowing down of Internet traffic going to the United States,"" said Bill Barney, chief executive of Pacnet. He declined to name the damaged cables operated by other companies, but said Pacnet's cable system connecting Japan to the US had not been damaged.

While the extent of the damage to undersea cables is still unclear and financial losses unknown, operators said they are undergoing an inspection and looking to expedite restoration. Pacnet aimed to repair two damaged segments of its East Asia Crossing network connecting Japan to other parts of Asia, like Taiwan and Hong Kong within five to seven days, Barney said. He played down concerns about any financial impact on Pacnet or regional telecom operators from the damaged cables. ""It's in our business plan that our cables will break, typically you get cuts in cables anywhere from five to 10 times a year,"" Barney said.

Several other companies also reported problems. The Japanese telecom operator KDDI said one of its undersea cables between Japan and the US had been damaged by the earthquake and was unable to transmit any signals. A spokesman said the company did not know if the cable was cut or having connection problems.

Identifying the problems may take some time as in some cases the damage is a long way off shore. KDDI said it was making efforts to identify and address the problem but added that services were beginning to recover after the quake.

Pacific Crossing, a unit of Japan's NTT Communications Corp. that operates a cable network between Japan and the US, also reported issues with its infrastructure. The Pacific Crossing PC-1 W and PC-1 N parts of its network remained out of service due to the earthquake, the company said.

NTT Communications said some of its services for enterprises were partially unavailable in Japan's Tohoku region, but that for submarine cables between Japan, other parts of Asia and the US the company was using backup cable routes. As regards its telephone services NTT say that it had restored 90% of its affected exchange offices some two weeks after the quake.

PCCW Ltd., which provides broadband Internet in Hong Kong, said Internet traffic to some international destinations, especially the US, were experiencing slower speeds due to several damaged cables that land in Japan, but it did not release details. In a statement PCCW said the affected cables would be repaired in ""the coming weeks.""

The Taiwan operator Chunghwa Telecom Co was one of the first to acknowledge problems with connectivity following the earthquake. On the same day an official said the earthquake had caused damage to an undersea cable near Kita on the eastern coast of Japan that belongs to the Asia Pacific Cable Network 2, owned by a consortium of 14 telecom operators led by AT&T.

China Telecom Corp, China's largest fixed-line operator by subscribers, was making emergency repairs to undersea cables damaged by the earthquake, Xinhua News Agency reported. The company said submarine fiber-optic cables connecting Japan and North America and a Pacific Crossing 1 cable near the city of Kitaibaraki, in Japan's northern Ibaraki Prefecture, were malfunctioning due to the earthquake.

Xinhua, citing an official from China Telecom, said the company had restored 65 gigabytes of outbound capacity, after the earthquake had disrupted 105 gigabytes of outbound Internet capacity and another 7 gigabytes of privately leased cable capacity.

Meanwhile China Mobile Ltd, the world's largest mobile carrier by accounts, said most of the company's services were operating normally despite a surge in calls to Japan, Xinhua reported. Another telecom operator China Unicom Ltd said most of its circuits had been repaired but cited connection problems with the network of Japan's NTT Communications.

Several companies said they avoided significant service disruptions by rerouting data traffic, including South Korean telecom operator KT Corp, which said a cable that is part of the Japan-US Cable Network was cut.

In the Philippines, Bayan Telecommunications Inc said the earthquake had disrupted some of its digital subscriber line services but said they would normalize services within a day.

Some operators were apparently unaffected by the disaster which befell the region. A spokeswoman for Australian operator Telstra Corp said none of the company's undersea cable infrastructure was damaged.","The article titled 'Quake damaged cables slow Asia's net' discusses the severing of undersea telecommunications cables due to the earthquake off the coast of Japan.

The captain of a cable ship reveals all.  

That the internet is physical can be hard to grasp. Few people have experienced this fact as viscerally as Guillaume Le Saux, captain of a ship named the Pierre de Fermat. It’s a state-of-the-art vessel that’s part of a fleet owned by French telecom company Orange, designed to lay and repair the optical fiber cables that criss-cross the world’s seabeds.

The life of a cable-ship captain is pretty intense. Le Saux is on constant alert, ready to be dispatched to the middle of an ocean with a couple of hours’ notice. This can sometimes mean sailing into 20-foot waves, receiving ransoms, or fixing up a shark’s chew toy.

When Le Saux arrives at the appointed spot at sea, he and his crew deploy Hector, the ship’s seven-ton underwater robot, which will travel to the seabed, sometimes at depths of 5,000 meters. Hector’s job is to inspect the damage, bury newly laid cable on the sea-floor, or help bring damaged sections up to the ship’s jointing room, all controlled from the ship’s deck.

On the day we meet, the Pierre de Fermat is anchored at Portland port, a commercial port on England’s south coast on the English Channel. It has just weathered a rough night at sea traveling from Brest in northern France. It’s a rare opportunity to board the ship, which is difficult to pin down because of its rapid deployments.

Getting on the ship requires walking up an aluminum gangplank nearly three stories high. On board, the crew is enjoying a lunch with wine, which is only allowed on Thursdays and Sundays. Below deck, I watch two kilometers of submarine cable being loaded into one of the ship’s nearly three-stories-high tanks. They have to be guided into place by hand by a team of six workers. Previous attempts to use mechanized means of loading and coiling have proved less efficient, Le Saux explained.

Once the cable was loaded, the Pierre de Fermat would embark on a three-week-long mission in the North Sea to repair British Telecom cables connecting the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The ship was just hours away from departing when I spoke to Le Saux about life at sea safeguarding the world’s data links in the most literal way possible, in an age of wireless data transfer and the rise of the cloud.

**Is it true that sharks attack submarine cables?**  
Guillaume Le Saux: It’s true, but it’s very rare. Sharks can smell the electricity, the electro-magnetic radiation, and because they seem to be very curious, they try to bite the cable. When the water is warm, it depends on the area, we have some specific cable protected with a sort of aluminum sheet to avoid the radiation being sensed by sharks and this cable is known as the “fish bite” cable.

**What about whales?**  
No, they cannot bite it or hurt it, because the cable is laid on the seabed.

**Are cables laid on the seabed even in the deepest parts of the ocean?**  
When engineers prepare the cabling operation, they try to determine the best way for the cable to go on the seabed in order not to consume too much cable. But if you have to go from Europe to the United States, you have to pass through the middle of the Atlantic, you will have to pass through a 5,000 meter water depth.

**What are some of the security measures in place around these cables?**  
The cables are very strategic. It’s very important for communications in all countries. So most of the time, countries where we lay the cable are involved also in the protection of this cable.

**Has this happened to you before?**  
In Indonesia, yeah, but it’s not very often. It’s very rare that the cable is cut intentionally.

**Your job is repairing cables. How do they get damaged?**  
The cables are damaged, maybe 80% of the time, due to human activities. Most of the time it’s a trawler trawling the seabed.

**How much notice do you get before you have to sail to a repair spot?**  
The contract for us, we are at 24-hour notice to leave the base-port to repair a cable.

**How did you end up in this line of work?**  
I’ve spent four and a half years as captain. But before that I was chief officer, I was also chief engineer, I was also mate, so it’s about 16 years now I am in this job.

**How has the industry changed in those 16 years?**  
Concentration of companies, less activity because the cables are now larger capacity.

**Do you think we’ll end up at a point where we don’t need cables for the internet?**  
I’m quite sure, no. We will always need cables. Because it’s a huge capacity, it’s less expensive than satellite, so I think we always need cables.

**And how’s your internet on this ship?**  
Poor! (laughs) Because we don’t have internet from the cable! We have internet from satellite.","The article discusses submarine cables extensively, including their installation, repair, and the challenges they face, particularly from human activities such as fishing.

It mentions that 80% of cable damage is due to human activities, which directly relates to the topic of cut sea cables.

The incident started a year ago when Vietnamese province Ba Ria-Vung Tau authorized fisherman to rip up undersea copper lines that were laid before 1975. They had planned to sell the copper as scrap. What the local government did not realize was that the fishermen weren't able to tell the difference between copper lines and fiber optic lines, therefore taking roughly 43 km of fiber optic cable—over half of it belonging to a company in Singapore. One Vietnamese newspaper reported that a 11 km section of the cable that transmits data to Thailand and Hong Kong would cost $5.8 million to replace.

""The general assessment is that most fishermen, and in some cases even the local authorities, had a very simple understanding of the consequences of the theft of under-sea fibre optic cable,"" wrote Vietnam's Ministry of Posts and Telematics in a report seen by Reuters.

In this analogy, undersea fiber optic cables act as the main arteries of the global internet, moving vast amounts of data across oceans much like arteries pump blood through the body. Data centers are akin to organs, processing and managing the data before sending it out. Meanwhile, cable landing stations are the capillaries that connect the cables to the local data centers, and just like in the human body, each component plays a critical role in keeping the whole system functioning.

**The Undersea Fiber Cables: The Arteries of the Internet**  
Just as arteries are the main highways for blood circulation, undersea fiber optic cables are the primary paths that data takes as it flows between continents. These cables stretch for thousands of miles across the ocean floor, transporting data in the form of light signals at incredible speeds. This “data blood” powers everything from email to video streaming, allowing for seamless global communication.  
Similar to how arteries have the crucial job of carrying oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body, undersea cables carry the vast majority of the world’s internet traffic (over 99%) between countries. Without these arteries, the internet as we know it would not function effectively, and large-scale communication between continents would be drastically slower.

**Cable Landing Stations: The Internet’s Capillaries**  
As blood flows through arteries and eventually reaches smaller capillaries that connect it to organs and tissues, data traveling through undersea cables reaches cable landing stations. These stations act as the “capillary” network of the internet, linking the massive undersea arteries to the terrestrial fiber networks on land.  
Once data arrives at a landing station, it is handed off to the local infrastructure, where smaller fiber optic cables route it to local data centers, cities, or even directly to businesses and homes. This is similar to how capillaries deliver nutrients and oxygen from the bloodstream to tissues throughout the body.

**Data Centers: The Organs of the Internet**  
Just as organs process and regulate what the body needs, data centers serve as critical processing hubs for the global internet. They manage, store, and distribute the data that flows through the network, ensuring that websites load, cloud applications function, and data is delivered to users efficiently.  
When data travels across the world, it doesn’t just pass through undersea arteries without processing—it needs to be stored and analyzed. Data centers take the “nutrients” (data) from the internet arteries and process them into usable information, much like organs process the oxygen and nutrients carried in the bloodstream to fuel the body.

Imagine you’re streaming a movie from a service like Netflix. The movie file is stored in a data center, where it is processed and prepared for delivery. Just like the liver processes nutrients from the blood, the data center processes the information, making it ready to be sent to your device through the internet’s vast network of fibers.

**How Data Flows: The Journey of Blood and Data**  
Let’s follow the flow of data, paralleling it to the body’s circulation of blood:

Data Creation – The Spark  
When you request something from the internet, like accessing a video on YouTube, it’s like the heart sending out a signal. Your device sends a data packet to a nearby data center, acting as the heart’s first beat, starting the journey.

Initial Data Transfer to Local Network (Arteries)  
This data is sent to a local data center through terrestrial fiber cables, much like the way blood is pumped through major arteries to reach different parts of the body. The data center either handles the request or forwards it along to another part of the world if the content is hosted in a different location.

Connecting to an Undersea Cable (Main Arteries)  
If your request needs to travel across the ocean, it enters the undersea cable network at a cable landing station, just like blood flows through the body’s largest arteries. These undersea cables then carry the data to its destination—another country, or even another continent—spanning thousands of miles under the sea.

Signal Amplification (Arterial Pressure Boosters)  
Along the way, the signal is boosted by repeater stations along the cable, akin to how the heart’s strong contractions keep blood moving through arteries, ensuring it reaches even distant parts of the body.

Arriving at Another Cable Landing Station (Capillary Network)  
Once the data reaches the opposite side of the ocean, it arrives at another cable landing station. From there, it flows into the local terrestrial fiber network, just as blood transitions from arteries into capillaries to nourish tissues.

Processing at a Foreign Data Center (Organ Processing)  
The data arrives at the relevant data center—think of it as an organ—where it is processed, stored, or forwarded on for delivery. If you’re streaming a movie, for example, the data center will retrieve the file, break it into smaller data packets, and prepare it for the return journey to your device.

Returning to Your Device (Veins Returning Blood)  
Once the data has been processed and packaged, it’s sent back through the same network, crossing the undersea arteries, landing stations, and local fiber networks until it reaches your device. Just like veins return blood to the heart, data travels back through the network, completing the cycle.

**The Symbiotic Relationship**  
In both the human body and the internet, every part of the system is crucial for proper functioning. The undersea cables (arteries), cable landing stations (capillaries), and data centers (organs) all rely on one another to ensure smooth data flow across the world. If one part of the network fails—whether it’s a severed undersea cable or an overloaded data center—the whole system can be affected, just like a blockage in an artery could disrupt blood flow to an organ.

**Challenges and Future of the Internet’s Arteries**  
Just as the body’s arteries can face issues like blockages or injury, the undersea fiber cables are vulnerable to damage from external forces such as ship anchors, earthquakes, or even marine life. For example, in 2008, a severed cable in the Mediterranean Sea caused widespread internet outages across the Middle East and South Asia, akin to a sudden blockage cutting off blood flow.

To protect against such risks, redundancy is built into the system. Multiple cables and landing stations ensure that if one route is damaged, the data can be rerouted, much like how the body has multiple blood vessels to maintain circulation in case of injury.

As the demand for data continues to grow with the rise of artificial intelligence, cloud services, and 5G technology, the arteries of the internet are expanding. New undersea cables are being laid, and data centers are becoming more powerful, much like how the body’s circulatory system adapts to the demands of physical growth and increased activity.

**Conclusion**  
Undersea fiber cables are the arteries of the internet, allowing data to flow freely across continents just as blood circulates through the body. Cable landing stations act as the capillary network, connecting these arteries to data centers, which process and distribute the data, much like organs nourish the body.

This complex, global network ensures that every website you visit, every video you stream, and every message you send can travel across the world in the blink of an eye. Without this infrastructure, our modern internet—like the human body without a circulatory system—would simply not function.","The article 'How Undersea Fiber Cables Power the Global Internet: The Internet’s Arteries' discusses undersea cables extensively, treating them as critical components of internet infrastructure.

It includes a significant discussion on the vulnerabilities of these cables, specifically mentioning that they can be damaged by external forces, with a notable example from 2008 where a severed cable caused widespread outages in the Middle East and South Asia.

Vietnam faces near total disconnection from the Internet because thieves are stealing the country's international telecoms cables, says a telecoms executive.

Almost 100 kilometers of cable have been stolen, with losses estimated at more than $4 million. The cables will take three months to fix, according to reports.

The thieves used fishing boats to pull up cables connecting Vietnam to Thailand, where they merge with global telecoms networks. The undersea lines lie unprotected on the seabed and can easily be dragged to the surface. 

Since the beginning of the year, 500 tons of fiber optic cable may have been stolen in five separate incidents. Vietnam's sole remaining high-capacity international cable was severely damaged by an earthquake last year, and further quakes could cut most Vietnamese off from the global internet.

Local bloggers have reported particularly poor internet connections in recent weeks, possibly due to the missing cables. Government officials have called for severe penalties for cable thieves, including prison sentences or even the death penalty.

**Update: Asian undersea cable disruption slows Internet access**  
By Sumner Lemon  
August 12, 2009 04:41 AM ET  

A segment of the Asia-Pacific Cable Network 2 (APCN2) undersea cable network between China and Taiwan suffered a serious cable fault on Wednesday, causing Internet traffic to be rerouted onto other undersea cables and slowing Internet access for some users in Southeast Asia.

At about 10:50 a.m. on Wednesday, local time, an alarm signaled a cable fault on Segment 7 of APCN2, which connects Hong Kong and Shantou, China. The disruption caused a temporary loss of service on the undersea link but all customers that use the cable were soon shifted to capacity on other cables, according to a source familiar with the situation.

The APCN2 cable is owned by a consortium of 26 telecom operators from 14 different countries. The cable links Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, South Korea, and Japan.

The exact cause of the APCN2 fault was not immediately known. The alarm indicated the disruption was caused by a ""single point of failure,"" which suggests a variety of possibilities, including a technical failure or a cable cut, the source said.

The incident was likely the main reason that Internet access appeared slower for some users in Singapore on Wednesday, the source said.

Undersea cables are used to transport much of the world's Internet traffic and can be easily damaged by natural disasters or other causes. In 2006, a powerful earthquake off the southern coast of Taiwan damaged several cables and slowed Internet access to a crawl for users in Southeast Asia.

Singapore Telecommunications (SingTel), which is an investor in APCN2, said its users may experience slower Internet access than normal to some U.S. Web sites, blaming the APCN2 fault on damage caused by Typhoon Morakot.

The [APCN2] consortium members have started restoration works, and our engineers are in the process of diverting Internet traffic to other cable systems. We expect the situation to return to acceptable levels within the next 24 hours,"" SingTel spokesman Chia Boon Chong said in an e-mail statement.

A spokesman for Starhub, another Singapore ISP that holds a stake in the cable, did not return a phone call seeking comment.

The fault that hit APCN2 on Wednesday follows two other service disruptions that recently hit the network. One disruption affected APCN2 Segment 7, between Hong Kong and Taiwan, and the other affected APCN2 Segment 1, which connects Singapore and Malaysia. However, both of these disruptions were deemed to be ""relatively minor"" compared to the disruption that took place Wednesday morning, the source said.

APCN2 isn't the only Asian undersea cable currently suffering from a service disruption.

""The Cable & Wireless Real Time Operations Team have logged multiple cable breaks on APCN2, APCN, EAC and SMW3 in Asia Pacific -- specifically, near Taiwan. Network traffic flow has been adversely affected in and out of the region as a result,"" said Gavin Tait, director of Asia network planning and implementation at Cable & Wireless, in an e-mail statement provided by the company.

None of Cable & Wireless customers were affected by these failures, he said.

Efforts are currently underway to repair the East Asia Crossing (EAC) undersea cable after it experienced ""double faults"" off the coast of Taiwan last weekend, according to Roland Lim, a spokesman for Pacnet, which owns EAC.

The first sign of damage to the EAC cable off the coast of Taiwan came on Aug. 9 at 1:37 a.m., local time, when an alarm signalled that service on EAC Segment D, which links Taiwan and Hong Kong, had been disrupted. At the time, traffic on Segment D was transferred to EAC Segment C. However, Segment C suffered a second disruption roughly twelve hours later.

The cause of the faults that hit the EAC cable between Hong Kong and Taiwan is not yet known, but the damage happened at about the same time the southern part of the island and China's southern coast was being pummeled by one of the most powerful typhoons to strike in recent memory. There were no earthquakes recorded by Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau at the time when the disruptions took place.","The article discusses a serious cable fault in the Asia-Pacific Cable Network 2, specifically mentioning that a segment of the undersea cable network experienced a fault that caused Internet traffic to be rerouted and slowed access for users in Southeast Asia.

It details the implications of the fault on Internet connectivity and discusses the possibility of a cable cut as a cause of the disruption.

A few years ago, an underwater cable broke, plunging a nation into Internet darkness. While some may say not having Facebook for a few hours is a positive thing, this was more than that, called “an absolute disaster . . . a national crisis.” It cut off not just social media, but email, cell phone service, financial transactions, business, and government communications.

It's still not clear what caused the breakage, but it was fixed about two weeks later.

And then, in 2022, it happened again. Only this time, it was worse.

You may recall seeing news on the Tonga volcano eruption and tsunami that left at least 6 dead, 19 injured, and others reported missing, with $90.4 million in damages. Besides bearing a devastating natural disaster, the people in Tonga lost their main connection to the outside world.

We can certainly understand why a volcanic eruption hundreds of times more powerful than the atomic bomb would take out a transpacific fiber optic cable, but it also underscores the fragility of our digital lives.

### A Brief History

In a way, the whole idea of laying a cable on the bottom of the ocean floor almost sounds like science fiction. How does a cable thousands of miles long even get made? How do they get it on the boat? How do they lay it on the ocean floor?

Cable breakages on land are bad enough, with everything from construction equipment, fires, even vandalism disrupting the fiber optics. But land “interruptions” are relatively easy to fix. How do they get repaired 25,000 feet (about 7.62 kilometers) underwater?

Communication cables laid on the ocean floor were not created when the Internet came along. The first “submarine cable” was dropped into the water in 1858, but only lasted about three weeks. It was attempted again in 1866, and worked, sending telegraph signals across the Atlantic. Telephone communications (i.e., AT&T) used underwater cables beginning in 1956 and the Internet started utilizing them in 1988.

Today, some estimates say there are 550,000 miles (about 885,000 kilometers) of transoceanic fiber optic cables, while others claim 750,000. That’s like stringing a line from the moon and back twice. Whatever the actual number, it is a lot, which means “The Cloud” is not really in the sky, but 5 miles underwater.

The cable itself is just a little bit more complex than its land-locked cousin. A “standard” fiber optic cable has a core, a cladding layer, and is usually coated with acrylate polymer or polyamide. There could be more layers of protection, depending on the application. Inside all of that is the optical fiber which carries the light. A submarine cable resting on the bottom of the ocean has more layers to protect it than a land-based one, like a scuba diver wears more than just a swimming suit.

_A cross section of the shore-end of a modern submarine communications cable._

Despite all this protection, an underwater cable can be damaged not just by volcanoes and tsunamis, but earthquakes, storm currents, ship anchors, and fishing trawlers. Even sharks looking for a snack.

Politics get involved as well, with both transoceanic cables and pipelines being sabotaged or blown up over governmental agendas and spats.

### How The Cables Are Made

As for the manufacturing process of undersea cables . . . yes, it is a big process. The cables are fed into a high-speed mill the size of a jet engine, put in a copper casing that may have plastic, steel or aluminum and even tar added to protect it from the elements.

You may think the end-product is fat and big, but it’s about as big as a larger-size garden hose. And the cable is designed to last 25 years if not subjected to volcanoes, earthquakes, or fishing trawlers.

The planning of where the cable is laid in the ocean takes at least a year so they can arrange its course miles underwater, where the seabed has been charted but a little unpredictable. After all, there are both trenches and mountains down there.

### Implementing The Fiber Optic Cable

Alcatel Submarine Networks (a part of Nokia) has more than 700,000 kilometers (435,000 miles) of optical submarine systems deployed worldwide (enough to circumnavigate the globe 16 times). One of the ships used to deploy the cable is about 450 feet long and can have as many as 80 crew members, with teams working in two 12-hour shifts. Although they have plenty of food for their long journey (two months or more), alcohol is not allowed. That’s for the better since the seas can be rough, sometimes so bad the captain may order operations to stop, cut the cable and find safe waters. Before cutting the cable, they tie a buoy to it so they can find it when they return.

Of course, the ship does not carry enough cable to span the whole ocean, so it is done in segments. The ship can carry up to 4,000 miles (about 6437.38 km) and it can take a month for the gigantic tanks (where the cable is stored) to be fully loaded.

A special subsea plow is used to trough and bury submarine cables along the seabed closer to shorelines where things like anchoring and fishing are most prevalent and could damage submarine cables.

Out at sea, the cable is unspooled into the water, attached to several buoys temporarily so it doesn’t sink to the bottom too soon. Once out far enough, the buoys are removed and the cable sinks to the ocean floor. This is repeated over and over.

Those of you who are thinking “Wait a minute! The light in fiber optics can only go so far before it loses strength — how can a cable traveling thousands and thousands of miles keep the signal alive?”

Repeaters placed every 60-70 kilometers — about 40 miles.

### The Technology of Submarine Cable

Power to the repeater is fed from power feeding equipment, which is located in Submarine Cable Station. In traditional submarine cables, every fiber pair will have their own repeaters, and four fiber pairs will have a repeater with a four-amplifier chassis. One amplifier chassis has dual laser 980nm pump units. This is called 2x2 Pump redundancy, the type of redundancy scheme used in the past.

Now they use 4x2 redundancies, improving reliability by using additional 2 pump lasers compared to the 2x2 pump redundancies. Two EDFA’s share the power from four pump lasers, which can tolerate three-pump laser failure at most in each fiber pair.

The submarine cables use DWDM (Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing) so the data capacity is maximized at hundreds of Gbps (gigabits per second). The cables also employ optical amplifiers (a.k.a. repeaters) that boost the signals across each cable section.

So, yes, laying a cable from, say, Oregon to Japan is quite complicated and time-consuming to say the least.

### From Land to Sea to Land

Once the cable (or more accurately, series of cables) reaches its land-based destination, it is connected to submarine line terminal (SLTE) and power feed equipment (PFE) installed at a cable landing station. The PFE can be installed at a cable landing station, while at another inland location — such as a data center or central office — the SLTE is set in place.

Broadband speeds are expected to be slower as a result and cable owners JT, Sure and BT say it could take up to three weeks to repair.

Telecom company JT says engineers have been dispatched to repair the cables.

Jersey's coastguard says there will be an investigation to see if the ship dropped anchor in a banned area.

Master Pilot Peter Moore said the boat, believed to be the King Arthur, anchored north of Alderney yesterday evening.

He says there are several undersea cables marked on the charts in that area with clear instructions not to fish or drop anchor.

All communications traffic from JT, the main operator in Jersey, is going through a single link to France with slower connections and call problems reported across the Channel Islands.

Daragh McDermott from JT said: ""With all traffic now using this connection, customers may notice some impact on services.

""It is exceptionally unlucky and unprecedented for three submarine cables to the UK to be cut in the same day.""

A number of people have reported losing internet completely earlier this morning with one woman saying she had to set up a mobile hotspot to get a connection.

Master Moore says it is still unclear where the King Arthur dropped anchor but there would be an investigation.

The BBC has approached the owners of the King Arthur, Mediterranea di Navigazione, for comment.

Guernsey's largest telecom company Sure says it has been working with JT to reroute its data through the Sure network as it was only their voice cables that were affected by the incident.

This is not the first time a ship has cut a Channel Islands telecom cable this year. In January one was cut when a ship dropped anchor in stormy weather.

Three cables went one after the other on Monday with the first going at 16:00 GMT and the last by 21:00 GMT as the anchor was dragged across the seabed.

Mr McDermott said repairing the cable would be a ""tricky, tricky job"" involving engineers going out in heavy winds to remove the cables from the sea and splice them back together.

"Tsunami and Earthquake Impact on Japan's Undersea Fiber-Optic Cables","Disruptions in Internet access reported by multiple Asian telecom operators due to damage from a tsunami and earthquake affecting undersea cables.","https://www.laserfocusworld.com/fiber-optics/article/16562059/tsunami-earthquake-damage-undersea-fiber-optic-cables-in-japan","2011-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","Gail Overton",Yes,"Gail Overton","Nashua, New Hampshire, USA","26500","2011-03-16","English","Wall Street Journal","**Japan**\--Following the massive earthquake and resulting tsunami in Japan on Friday, major telecom operators scrambled to minimize the impact of damage to several fiber-optic submarine cables. Many Asian telecom operators and users were reporting some disruptions in Internet access Monday, though the partial restoration of service was accomplished by rerouting optical communications traffic over undamaged cables and via satellites.

About half of the existing cables running across the Pacific are damaged and ""a lot of people are feeling a little bit of slowing down of Internet traffic going to the United States,"" said Bill Barney, chief executive of Hong Kong-based cable-network operator Pacnet. He declined to name the damaged cables operated by other companies, but said Pacnet's cable system connecting Japan to the U.S. isn't damaged so far. Some operators were unaffected. A spokeswoman for Australian operator Telstra Corp. (TLS.AU) said none of the company's undersea cable infrastructure was damaged.

The submarine fiber-optic cables, which can cost hundreds of millions of dollars, are typically owned by consortia of telecom companies, who share costs and capacity. While the clusters of glass fibers are enclosed in protective material, they remain vulnerable to undersea earthquakes, fishing trawlers, and ship anchors. There are also many choke points around the globe where a number of key cables converge.

While the extent of the damage to undersea cables is still unclear and financial losses unknown, operators said they are undergoing an inspection and looking to expedite restoration. Japanese telecom operator KDDI Corp. (9433.TO) said Monday one of its undersea cables between Japan and the U.S. has been damaged by the earthquake and is unable to transmit any signals, but a spokesman said the company didn't know if the cable was cut or having connection problems. The damaged part is far offshore, and it may take a while for KDDI to identify and address the problem but services are recovering after the quake, as the company can bypass the damaged part and use other cables instead, the spokesman said.

Pacific Crossing, a unit of Japan's NTT Communications Corp. that operates a cable network between Japan and the U.S., said Monday the Pacific Crossing PC-1 W and PC-1 N parts of its network remained out of service due to the earthquake. NTT Communications said some of its services for enterprises were partially unavailable in Japan's Tohoku region, but that for submarine cables between Japan, other parts of Asia and the U.S. the company is using backup cable routes.

An official from Taiwan operator Chunghwa Telecom Co. (2412.TW) said Friday the earthquake caused damage near Kita on the eastern coast of Japan to an undersea cable that belongs to the Asia Pacific Cable Network 2, which is owned by a consortium of 14 telecom operators led by AT&T Inc. (T). AT&T didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.

China Telecom Corp. (CHA), China's largest fixed-line operator by subscribers, was making emergency repairs on Friday to undersea cables damaged by the earthquake, Xinhua News Agency reported. The company said submarine fiber-optic cables connecting Japan and North America and a Pacific Crossing 1 cable near the city of Kitaibaraki, in Japan's northern Ibaraki Prefecture, were malfunctioning due to the earthquake. A China Telecom spokeswoman wasn't immediately available to comment on Monday on the status of the repairs.

Xinhua on Monday cited China Telecom as saying the company had restored 65 gigabytes of outbound capacity, after the quake had disrupted 105 gigabytes of outbound Internet capacity and another 7 gigabytes of privately leased cable capacity.

Several companies said they avoided significant service disruptions by rerouting data traffic, including South Korean telecom operator KT Corp. (KT), which said a cable that is part of the Japan-U.S. Cable Network was cut; SK Telink Corp., an affiliate of South Korean operator SK Telecom Co. (SKM); and Globe Telecom Inc. (GLO.PH) of the Philippines.

Announcing [fresh sanctions](https://www.rferl.org/a/u-s-imposes-sanctions-on-russians-for-malicious-cyberactivity/29283702.html) against Russia this week, the U.S. Treasury Department accused Moscow of ""tracking undersea communications cables"" and imposed punitive measures on a St. Petersburg firm that it says provided underwater diving equipment to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB).

The announcement followed warnings by U.S. and other Western officials about Russian activities in recent years near undersea cables that serve as conduits for nearly all global telecommunications data.

""We are now seeing Russian underwater activity in the vicinity of undersea cables that I don't believe we have ever seen,"" U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Andrew Lennon, the commander of NATO's submarine forces, [told The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russian-submarines-are-prowling-around-vital-undersea-cables-its-making-nato-nervous/2017/12/22/d4c1f3da-e5d0-11e7-927a-e72eac1e73b6_story.html?utm_term=.bb54be6cc1c6) in December.

Britain's military chief, Sir Stuart Peach, said in December that Russia could pose a major threat to NATO by attacking undersea cables critical for international trade and the Internet. He warned that economies could be hit ""immediately and potentially catastrophically"" if the cables were severed or otherwise disrupted.

But just how vulnerable is this network of cables, known as the ""backbone of the global Internet,"" to sabotage and other manipulation?

The location of cables -- which are roughly the diameter of a garden hose -- along the ocean floor offers a modicum of security from actors who would intentionally try to damage them.

""It's not that it's much more difficult to sever cables in the deep ocean, it's just that the primary forms of interference are less likely to happen,"" [writes Nicole Starosielski](https://theconversation.com/in-our-wi-fi-world-the-internet-still-depends-on-undersea-cables-49936), an associate professor at New York University and author of the 2015 book The Undersea Network.

Experts say that the multiple paths for telecommunications traffic via the cables also offer security: If a single cable were broken, in most cases that traffic would be rerouted around different parts of the network.

As of early 2018, there were an estimated 448 submarine cables -- totaling more than 1 million kilometers in length -- operating throughout the world, [according to TeleGeography](https://www2.telegeography.com/submarine-cable-faqs-frequently-asked-questions).

This network, however, includes so-called ""chokepoints"" where crucial cable routes converge, according to a 2010 study by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the EastWest Institute think tank.

""A single disaster in such an area could cause catastrophic loss of regional and global connectivity,"" the [report said](https://www.reuters.com/article/security-cables/undersea-telcoms-cables-face-growing-risks-report-idUSLDE63J0NJ20100420).

Starosielski [told Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-undersea-internet-cables/) last month, however, that ""the amount of anxiety about somebody sabotaging a single cable or multiple cables is overblown.""

""If somebody knew how these systems worked and if they staged an attack in the right way, then they could disrupt the entire system. But the likelihood of that happening is very small. Most of the concerns and fears are not nearly a threat at all,"" she said.

Undersea cables are, in fact, damaged regularly, with experts estimating between 100 and 200 such incidents each year. Two of the main causes are less exotic than state sabotage; namely, anchors dragging across the seabed and fishing gear that gets tangled up with the cables, experts say.

There have been incidents of sharks biting deep-sea fiber-optic cables, though the Britain-based International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) recorded no such incident between 2007 and 2014.

In 2013, the Egyptian coast guard [arrested three divers](https://www.reuters.com/article/net-us-egypt-internet/egypt-catches-divers-cutting-internet-cable-amid-disruptions-idUSBRE92Q1AQ20130327) who authorities said were cutting through a cable near Alexandria, though officials did not indicate a motive.

Almost all undersea cables are privately owned, and the ICPC -- which has more than 170 members from more than 60 countries -- has called for action by governments around the world to safeguard the deep-ocean networks.

Undersea cables have also been targeted for surveillance purposes.

The United States tapped Soviet cables in the Sea of Okhotsk during the Cold War, and documents leaked by former U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden indicated that U.S. and British intelligence had gained access to data transmitted in undersea cables.

In September 2015, the United States monitored the Russian research vessel Yantar as it traveled to Cuba along the U.S. East Coast. The New York Times [cited U.S. Navy officials](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/world/europe/russian-presence-near-undersea-cables-concerns-us.html) as saying that it carried submersible crafts capable of diving and cutting undersea cables.

An official Russian government publication has openly discussed Yantar's surveillance capabilities.

""Yantar has devices aboard intended for deep-sea tracking, as well as equipment for connecting to top-secret communications cables,"" the official newspaper of the Russian parliament [wrote in October](https://www.pnp.ru/politics/korabl-specnaznacheniya-yantar-voshyol-v-sredizemnoe-more.html).

The U.S. Treasury Department, which identified the St. Petersburg underwater equipment company as Divetechnoservice, did not explicitly specify any connection between it and the Yantar Baltic Shipyard, which built the Yantar research vessel.

However, Russian government procurement documents, as well as arbitration records, show that Divetechnoservice signed contracts in 2012 with the shipyard to produce and test a one- and two-man deep-water submersible capable of operating at depths up to 1,000 meters (3,000 feet). And the company's website includes photographs of the submersible crafts.","The article discusses the vulnerabilities of undersea cables, including potential threats from Russian activities and the causes of cable damage.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The South Pacific nation of Tonga has been all but cut off from the internet this week after an undersea cable connecting the archipelago to the wider world was severed twice on Sunday, throwing communications across the tiny and isolated country into chaos.

The outage, which the cable’s owner said may have been caused by a ship’s anchor, also knocked out overseas phone calls and is hampering money transfers, airline bookings, university enrolments as well as Facebook connections to family and friends.

In the capital, Nuku’alofa, a satellite dish was hastily mounted on Monday to provide limited and slow backup connectivity, prompting hundreds of people to queue outside a government telecom office where the signal is most reliable.

“It’s like going back to the beginning of the internet,” Tonga police spokeswoman Sia Adams said on the phone. “You just wait for your turn to have your 20 minutes to access...it’s currently hot here in Tonga at the moment but they’ve put up a tent outside, with chairs, so people can wait.”

Hours have been extended to midnight to handle crowds of officials, business people and ordinary folk logging on to access cash remittances, buy plane tickets and “just chat” said Filimone Iloa, an employee at Tonga Communications Corporation.

The problem illustrates the vulnerability of undersea fiber-optic cables, which with a data-carrying capacity some 200 times that of satellites have become the backbone of global communications. Broken cables left Somalia without internet for weeks in 2017 and cut off parts of Egypt and India in 2008.

“I have a hotel and I have no idea who’s booked on Booking.com or Expedia,” said Kjell Stave, who owns the Mystic Sands hotel in the Vava’u archipelago in northern Tonga and cannot connect. Airlines were also unable to tell if flights were overbooked until passengers showed up, he added.

Tonga’s cable, which joins the country to trans-Pacific internet wires at Suva in Fiji, was severed in two spots within about 10 km (6.2 miles) of Tonga’s shoreline on Sunday night, Paula Piveni Piukala, director at cable owner Tonga Cable Ltd told Reuters.

“We haven’t really ascertained the cause, but most likely it was a boat with an anchor has dragged the cable, or something of this sort,” he said. Piukala happened to be at a telecom industry meeting in Hawaii when the breaks occurred, and so was able to quickly arrange the backup satellite link, though he said it could only provide about a tenth of the cable’s capacity.

“The main connectivity to the outside world was through the cable,” he said, adding a repair ship was preparing to leave from Samoa and could fix the problem in a week or two, weather permitting.","The article discusses the severing of an undersea cable that connects Tonga to the global internet.

**ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS**  
Undersea communication cables became an academic interest of mine a few years ago. I was fascinated by the subject and shocked to learn how little is known about them. In 2008, I wrote a research proposal on a public-private partnership for cables and received a Department of Homeland Security Fellowship to attend Harvard Kennedy School to study the issue further. This work is a culmination of that proposal and process.  

I owe many thanks to the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education and the Department of Homeland Security for supporting me in this research. Some of it was developed this summer while working for the Department of Homeland Security ALERT Center of Excellence at Northeastern University. To my project mentors at ALERT, Michael Silevitch and John Beaty, I owe a debt of gratitude for developing my initial ideas and barring with me through my first presentations.  

I especially want to thank Eric Rosenbach, my faculty advisor, who appreciated the significance of this project enough to find funding for me to attend professional conferences on the subject. His overall guidance was truly beneficial, particularly since he has been my interface with my client throughout the year.  

Overall, this paper incorporates research collected from presentations delivered at two professional conferences, the Reliability of Global Undersea Communication Cables Infrastructure (ROGUCCI) Summit and the Pacific Telecommunications Council (PTC) 2010, several dozen interviews and informal conversations with industry experts, a vast literature review, as well as source documents provided to me from the Department of Homeland Security.

Commissioned in 2000, the South-East Asia - Middle East - Western Europe 3 two fibre pair cable is some 39,000 kilometres long in total, spanning stretches of the globe from northern Germany to Australia and Japan. Its current capacity is 480 Gbps (10Gbps x 48 wavelengths).

A Sea-Me-We 3 fault notice - sighted by _iTnews_ - says the fault occurred from January 10 between repeaters 345 and 346, some 1,126 kilometres from the Tuas cable station in Singapore.

The operators of the cable said the implications for customers ""should be minimal"".

However, the notice warns that ""customers could still experience increased latency, as services are routed via alternative routes which will be heavily utilised by other carriers also affected by this fault.""

A repair ship, the ASEAN Explorer is set to arrive on the fault site on February 7, with an estimated resolution date of February 11.

The cable has been impacted by major disruptions in the past, caused by ship's anchors, earthquakes and other phenomena. A 2005 break cut all of Pakistan's electronic communications, affecting roughly 10 million internet users.

The chief executive and founder of ISP Vocus, James Spenceley, confirmed to _ITnews_ that the cable had been severed.

""SMW3 is a single strand cable system and unfortunately this type of event happens every few years to those,"" Spenceley explains.

""The time to repair is not unusual given distances and complexity of undersea cable repair. It really highlights the requirement for cable system diversity or protection such as the ring design of the Southern Cross cable system.""

Michael Malone, chief executive of iiNet told _iTnews_ that to his understanding, there is no actual customer impact - but the ISP's choice of routes has diminished.

""We are operating without backup until the cut is fixed,"" Malone says.

He echoed Spenceley's point about underseas cables being difficult to repair.

""Fixing underseas cables is an extraordinarily unsophisticated process involving a ship equipped with a long stick that has a hook at the end,"" Malone says.

Dhaka, June 1 — Maritime thieves have stolen at least 11-kilometres Vietnamese portion of Thailand bound SEA-ME-WE3 submarine cable and sold the 100 tons of illicit cargo as scrap, reported VietNamNet Bridge online newspaper Tuesday.

Such bizarre underwater international telecoms infrastructure robbery occurred on March 25 and since then Vietnam’s Internet users have been struggling with far slower speed.

The broken cable system, named TVH, was built in 1993-1995, connecting Thailand, Vietnam and Hong Kong with a capacity of 560 megabits per second.

The Vietnam Telecom International (VTI) got puzzled when the cable went down. It occurred soon after the Asia Pacific region recovered from prolonged bandwidth crisis as earthquake snapped bunch of submarine cables in the Taiwanese coast.

VTI called a submarine cable fixing ship from Singapore. But its crew went bonkers after detecting 11-kilometres of the cable was missing from the floor of Ca Mau Sea. The maintenance vessel went back as it never carries that many cables in the first place.

Baffled VTI already lost four million dollars revenue and it will incur further 2.6 millions dollars to fix the underwater missing link. Vietnam’s Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Public Security, the Naval Command and military commands joined hands to catch the fishy fishermen.

Authorities have not discovered who initially cut the cable. But last Wednesday, police in the southern coastal town of Vung Tau said they captured a boat carrying 60 tons of undersea optical fibre cable.

Earlier the police also captured three boats and recovered 40 tons of similar cables. Same man, a Vung Tau resident, allegedly owns all the four boats.

But VTI’s deputy director Lan Quoc Cuong said the cable seized by police in Vung Tau does not match the cable his company owns, and they must have come from a different severed line.

He said finding the cable would have been difficult for the thieves. “The cable is located in different locations and at different depths,” he said. “Maybe, while using an anchor, they found the cable by accident and started cutting it.”

Meanwhile the Vietnamese media has made a disturbing revelation. The country’s defence ministry contracted few companies last August to salvage the decommissioned undersea copper cables. The US-backed former South Vietnamese government deployed them before the country became independent in 1975.

Reports said some of these companies apparently went for legitimate undersea treasures hunt but they may have struck the operational undersea fibre optic cables instead.

Whatever the case may be, robbing the submarine cable is getting rampant in Vietnam. So far this year, five undersea optical cable theft cases have been detected.

The latest case was on May 3 when border guards of the southern province of Kien Giang detected two fishing boats carrying 80 tonnes of cable. A boat owner said that while catching fish offshore, his boat caught the cable and they cut the cable and brought it to the mainland to sell.

Earlier on April 15, three fishing boats loaded with 80 tonnes of cable were caught in the southern province of Soc Trang. Fishermen on those boats said that they found the cable offshore and stopped catching fish to cut the cable to sell as waste.

Authorities of Kien Giang, Bac Lieu, Soc Trang provinces have seized hundreds of tonnes of telecom cable from fishing boats. Police say they have broken up five rings selling some 500 tons of illegally salvaged cable since the beginning of this year.","The article titled ""Vietnam's submarine cable 'lost' and 'found'"" discusses the theft of submarine cables in Vietnam, specifically mentioning that maritime thieves stole 11 kilometers of a cable, leading to significant disruptions in internet connectivity for users in the country.

It highlights the financial impact on Vietnam Telecom International (VTI), which has already lost four million dollars in revenue and will incur further costs to repair the damaged infrastructure.

The article also details the involvement of various authorities in recovering the stolen cables and mentions multiple incidents of cable theft occurring in the region.

This comprehensive discussion about the theft and its implications clearly establishes the article's focus on the topic of cut sea cables."

Subsea cable operator Seacom encountered a service-affecting outage on its cable system on 24 February.

In a statement, the company says the disruption is only on the segment of the cable that runs from Mombasa (Kenya) to Zafarana (Egypt).

Initial assessments suggest the disruption to the subsea cable occurred within the vicinity of the Red Sea, and other cables in the area appear to have also been impacted, it adds.

Seacom says it is unable to confirm the cause of the disruption at this time, but is working with its cable repair partner to assess the feasibility of the repair in the region.

The firm points out that the location of the cable break is significant due to its geopolitical sensitivity and ongoing tensions, making it a challenging environment for maintenance and repair operations.

“Seacom still continues to carry traffic on its own cable between Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and South Africa for both transmission and IP services,” says the company.

“All other IP-based services destined for Europe and other regions were automatically rerouted via Seacom’s alternative routes on Equiano, PEACE and WACS cable systems, and supported by its diverse terrestrial infrastructure, ensuring its clients remain operational with some latency in their internet communications.”

It notes that although the outage has had an impact on some clients’ businesses across East and Southern Africa, Seacom has been working diligently to ensure the continuity of its services.

“Seacom provided customers with a cautionary alert on 5 February that any disruptions to the cable system could be impacted by delays in repair operations due to the instability of the area. The team is currently working towards restoration timelines and will communicate these plans with our clients,” it concludes.","The article titled 'Seacom Confirms Cable Outage in Red Sea' discusses a specific incident involving a subsea cable outage that occurred on February 24, 2024.

**February 5, 2008**  

When the Internet suddenly collapsed early last Wednesday across the Middle East and into India, it provided a stark reminder of how the Net's virtual spaces can still be held hostage to real-world events.

Almost simultaneously, two separate undersea fiber-optic cables connecting Europe with Egypt, and eventually with the Middle East and India, were cut. The precise cause remains unknown: experts initially said that ships' anchors, dragged by stormy weather across the sea floor, were the most likely culprit, but Egyptian authorities have said that no ships were in the region.

Whatever the cause, the effects were immediate. According to its telecommunications ministry, Egypt initially lost 70 percent of its connection to the outside Internet and 30 percent of service to its call-center industry, which depended less on the lines. Between 50 and 60 percent of India's Net outbound connectivity was similarly lost on the westbound route critical to the nation's burgeoning outsourcing industry.

""This [fiber path across the Mediterranean] is a choke point, which until recently was a very lightly trafficked route where there wasn't great need for cable,"" says Tim Strong, an analyst at telecommunications research firm Telegeography Research. ""There are many new cables planned for the region, but as it happens, they're not in service yet.""

Undersea cable damage is hardly rare--indeed, more than 50 repair operations were mounted in the Atlantic alone last year, according to marine cable repair company Global Marine Systems. But last week's breaks came at one of the world's bottlenecks, where Net traffic for whole regions is funneled along a single route.

This kind of damage is rarely such a deep concern in the United States and Europe. The Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are crisscrossed so completely with fast fiber networks that a break in one area typically has no significant effect. Net traffic simply uses one of many possible alternate destinations to reach its goal.

Not so with the route connecting Europe to Egypt, and from there to the Middle East. Today, just three major data cables stretch from Italy to Egypt and run down the Suez Canal, and from there to much of the Middle East. (A separate line connects Italy with Israel.) A serious cut here is immediately obvious across the region, and a double cut can be crippling.","The article titled ""Analyzing the Internet Collapse"" discusses multiple outages in India and the Middle East due to the cutting of undersea fiber-optic cables.

Without undersea cables, a bank in Asian countries couldn't send money to Saudi Arabia to pay for oil. US military leaders would struggle to communicate with troops fighting extremists in Afghanistan and the Middle East. A student in Europe wouldn't be able to Skype his parents in the United States.

All this information is transmitted along tiny glass fibers encased in undersea cables that, in some cases, are little bigger than a garden hose. All told, there are 620,000 miles of fiber-optic cable running under the sea, enough to loop around the earth nearly 25 times.

### Locations are easily identified on public maps

Most lines are owned by private telecommunications companies, including giants like Google and Microsoft. Their locations are easily identified on public maps, with swirling lines that look like spaghetti. While cutting one cable might have limited impact, severing several simultaneously or at choke points could cause a major outage.

### Internet connectivity to several countries

On Oct. 18, 2016, a Syrian telecom company ordered emergency maintenance to repair a cable in the Mediterranean that provides internet connectivity to several countries, including Syria, Libya and Lebanon. The Yantar arrived in the area the day before the four-day maintenance began. It left two days before the maintenance ended. It's unknown what work it did while there.

Watkins described another episode on Nov. 5, 2016, when a submarine cable linking Persian Gulf nations experienced outages in Iran. Hours later, the Yantar left Oman and headed to an area about 60 miles west of the Iranian port city of Bushehr, where the cable runs ashore. Connectivity was restored just hours before the Yantar arrived on Nov. 9. The boat stayed stationary over the site for several more days.

Cable repairers are working to repair damage.

Advisories by the TPG-owned iiNet and Internode report that the main issue for Australians is a cable break around 54 kilometres off the coast of Hong Kong.

“We have temporarily routed via the US and redirected peering whilst the issue is outstanding,” both ISPs reported.

“Our network partner is currently engaged with submarine teams for initiation of repair process.”

One of the affected cables is SEA-ME-WE3, which currently routes traffic from Perth to Singapore and beyond.

The cable has 39 landing points, including Deep Water Bay in Hong Kong.

Although repair teams have been engaged, SEA-ME-WE3 is expected to face problems for some time.

Wholesale operators have confirmed the break and said they have “received a tentative repair completion of 13th October 2017”.

“However these dates tend to change over time due to the nature of [subsea repairs],” the operators advised customers.

ISPs say that while they are forced to route Asian traffic via the US, internet users should expect speed, latency and packet loss problems “to international destinations in Asia”.

“This may result in webpages taking longer to load, as well as impact to time-sensitive activities such as online gaming,” they said.

The damage to this major data pipe, along with reportedly two others, has caused severe internet speed degradation for users in India, especially for customers of BSNL, MTNL, Bharti Airtel, and Tata Communications, and is expected to disrupt services for the next 20-30 days.

While the extent of full damage and situation is still being assessed, Rajesh Chharia, president at the Association of Internet Service Providers of India, explained:

> ""Currently, internet and data usage are low because of the festive season. India will feel the impact from Monday when offices and businesses come back. Telcos have diverted all traffic from the Atlantic route to the Pacific, but our connectivity to the latter route is not sufficient to cater to all of India's traffic.""

*   Bharti Airtel has said that the cable cuts had not impacted its voice traffic, and they are taking all necessary steps to ensure data services were available to their customers by routing traffic on alternative routes. I am personally using Airtel 3G in Rajasthan and it seems to be working fine at the moment, while BSNL EVDO and fixed-line broadband services are facing severe connectivity issues.
*   BSNL executives said the company is diverting its traffic on other cables linking India with Europe and the US, but speeds are still terribly slow.
*   Reliance Communications said its network is not impacted as its cable systems, including FEA, FALCON, and HAWK, were not impacted.

But just because destroying the cables would be logistically and technically difficult for a terrorist or individual—not to mention suicidal; the voltage running through them would be enough to kill someone trying to cut through—doesn’t make it unthinkable. In March, Egyptian authorities accused three men in a fishing boat of trying to sever a submarine cable connecting Alexandria to the Web. The evidence was thin and experts are as cynical about that incident as the latest service disruption in Syria. But both episodes draw attention to how exposed the world’s Internet infrastructure really is.

Let’s begin with how the cables are physically stabilized. They’re not. The cables tend to rest unsecured on the ocean floor. Landslides, ship anchors—all are capable of moving or dragging the cables out of their normal position. Pull too hard, and they break. In 2006, an underwater landslide between Taiwan and the Philippines disrupted 19 out of 20 Internet cables in the area, causing service in much of Asia to go dark. Even though software could tell the repair crews exactly which part of the cables had malfunctioned, locating the actual point of the break took more time because the event had moved the cables and buried them.

There are other vulnerabilities, too. When the cables make landfall, they generally terminate at a control station that brings together more than one submarine cable. Disable the control station, and you might be able to cause some level of disruption downstream. These facilities are only lightly guarded, according to David Belson, who authors an annual “State of the Internet” report for Akamai, the Web-traffic routing company.

“They don’t have sharks with lasers on their heads, or armed guards, or anything like that,” Belson told me. “In many cases, the cables will just come ashore in some nondescript shack.”

The United States is home to at least a couple dozen such stations. Responsibility for defending them—and the underwater cables themselves—falls to the host country, or the consortium of companies that initially laid the fiber down. But there isn’t much patrolling that takes place, said Jason Healey, director of the Atlantic Council’s Cyber Statecraft Initiative. That’s because the assumption is most well-meaning people will try and avoid the cables.

Maritime cables are “extremely” well marked on maps, said Healey. That helps trawlers and tankers steer clear, but it could also aid a malicious actor under other circumstances.

Healey has worked with the White House on a number of cyber war-game exercises. In one scenario, fictitious Iranians disrupted the Internet by convincing a handful of ship captains to drag their anchors across the ocean floor off of Djibouti, France, Great Britain and Egypt.

Only in British waters would an attempt like that be reliably caught, said Healey.

“The British patrol heavily outside Bude,” he told me, referring to the cable landing station located in Cornwall. “If you’re in the area, they are going to be paying a lot of interest to you, and if you cut the cables they would be all over you very quickly, probably within minutes.”

Areas that are less well-developed—Djibouti, say—would almost certainly lack the capacity to defend the cables the same way. Luckily, nobody’s launched a “Die Hard”-style plot to unplug everything—yet. For now, all we have to worry about are environmental hazards. And “terrorists.”

**INTRODUCTION**
The backbone of the nation’s—and indeed, of the world’s—information infrastructure is now preponderantly composed of fiber optic cables. A critical element of that backbone is the world’s ever-expanding network of submarine fiber optic cables. The importance of those cables could conceivably make them a potential target or targets for other states or terrorists. This appendix briefly documents the importance of the fiber optic cable network to the United States, potential vulnerabilities in the network, and the possible ramifications for the United States of a widespread network failure brought about by an act of sabotage.

Over the past decade, the increased demand for bandwidth driven by the Internet, as well as the continuing international trend of privatization of national telecommunications industries, has outstripped by far the resources offered by satellite transmission of voice and data. Instead, the fraction of transoceanic voice and data transmitted over undersea cables has grown in the past 12 years from 2 percent to as high as 80 percent in 2000. As demand has grown, so have the numbers of cables on the seabed.

**VULNERABILITIES?**
These fiber optic networks offer a number of security advantages over satellite communications. Fiber optic cables are thought to be much harder to “eavesdrop” on than satellites and have more dependable installation and repair practices. However, those fiber optic cables are in many ways significantly more vulnerable than is commonly thought. Submarine cables already face many man-made and natural dangers. Anchors dropped from ships and dredging fishing nets are two of the most common. The occasionally volatile nature of the seabed can expose a previously buried segment of cable.

Security is an important issue, because these cables are an increasingly vital element of the global economy. An intentional systemwide disruption of fiber optic cables could cause significant commercial damage. In particular, the ability of overseas firms to get reliable, real-time data regarding U.S. markets—and vice versa—could be substantially curtailed, potentially sparking a panic.

**Potential Vulnerabilities**
In recent years, wiring companies have focused on redundancy as an important aspect of the cable network. However, the desire for security against inadvertent nautical events may have been counterproductive. The results of this “stacking” can be seen in the fact that many cable systems terminate in only a few cities. A successful attack on these points could cause enormous damage to the entire system.

Moreover, Taiwan would be unable to depend on a vast overland information infrastructure beyond its borders in the event of damage to its fiber optic lifelines. A recent example of the chaos potentially caused by communications outages is that of Australia, where one cut cable caused a significant loss of Internet capacity for its largest provider, Telstra.

**Conclusion**
The vulnerabilities of submarine cables pose serious risks not only to telecommunications but also to national security and economic stability. The increasing reliance on these cables necessitates a comprehensive understanding and proactive measures to protect this critical infrastructure.","The article titled 'Vulnerabilities of Submarine Cables' discusses the importance and vulnerabilities of submarine cables extensively.

It mentions potential threats to these cables, including damage from anchors and fishing nets, which implies discussions about 'cut' cables.

Furthermore, it highlights the significant impact that cable damage can have on internet connectivity and telecommunications, citing specific examples such as the disruption of Telstra's services in Australia due to a cut cable.

Jackson School of International Studies","In 2013, BRICS business leaders announced plans to construct a $185 million submarine cable connecting Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. However, more than three years later, the BRICS cable has not come to fruition, presumably due to intra-bloc political differences and challenging domestic economic positions.

China is filling the vacuum left by the BRICS cable. Its companies are the most active investors and builders of submarine cables in the developing world. Between 2012 and 2015, Chinese companies were involved with only 7% of disclosed global submarine cable projects, and exclusively with projects that connected either to the Chinese Mainland, Taiwan, or Hong Kong. In contrast, between 2016 and 2019, Chinese companies will participate in 20% of all cable construction projects, over half of which take place outside the South China Sea.

Chinese companies lag behind only the French company Alcatel-Lucent and the Swiss-owned TE Connectivity in total future submarine cable project activity. While Alcatel and TE Connectivity have had decades to expand and engage with the global market, the market share gained by Chinese companies in a relatively short period of time may signal Chinese market dominance in the near future. The meteoric rise of Chinese companies in submarine cable ownership and construction makes it abundantly clear that the Chinese are here to make an impact on the world of Internet infrastructure.

Chinese Cable Consortiums and Construction Projects
---------------------------------------------------

Chinese state-owned telecommunications companies are actively expanding their network of cable consortium partnerships. China Unicom, China Telecom, and China Mobile are three state-owned telecommunications providers listed as owners of the new SeaMeWe-5 cable connecting Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Whereas Chinese companies have traditionally participated only in projects that directly involving Chinese territory, Chinese companies are also investing beyond Asia; for example, China Unicom shares ownership of a cable connecting Cameroon and Brazil.

While state-owned companies join cable ownership consortiums, Huawei Marine Systems is installing multiple submarine cables throughout the world. A 2008 joint venture between the Chinese technology giant Huawei and the British company Global Marine Systems, Huawei Marine Systems is making headlines for its work in Africa. At AfricaCom 2016, Huawei announced plans to build eight new cable systems (two of which are included in the count above, six more of which remain to be announced) connecting the continent and upgrade two existing cables. In the last year, Huawei has also been commissioned to build cables connecting Malaysia, Cambodia, and Thailand, build a national broadband transmission network for Papua New Guinea, construct a new cable for Belize, and partner with LTI on a cable project in Indonesia. Recently completed cables include a joint venture with Ooredoo in the Maldives, and Huawei’s tenth project in Africa.

China’s New Global Orientation in Political Context
---------------------------------------------------

China’s rise as a formidable player in ICT development may stem from domestic business policy. Around 2015, the Chinese government gave its telecommunications companies permission to fully expand globally. Before, Chinese companies were more restricted in their global reach, although Huawei managed to participate in a few cable projects, including one connecting Suriname and Guiana, which raised eyebrows as early as 2010. China’s ICT expansion is in line with China’s desire to expand its global reach.

For example, Huawei’s involvement in Africa largely mirrors other investments in non-digital regional infrastructure, which increases China’s influence, helps foster new markets for Chinese goods, and provides Beijing with valuable access to natural resources and agriculture. In other words, sending Chinese telecoms abroad through ownership and construction contracts may ultimately fall in line with Beijing’s long-term political and economic goals.

Demand for Chinese investment and construction is also fueled by a global political climate wary of Western, particularly American, Internet infrastructure. While the BRICS cable may be indefinitely stalled, demand for a BRICS-like cable persists. The elevated role of Chinese telecommunications companies in owning and constructing submarine cables responds to this demand by providing an alternative to previously dominant American-led consortiums. Additionally, many Western cable companies have stopped investing in new cables due to their limited financial returns and the omnipotence of Western connectivity. China remains one of the few partners available to countries seeking to grow their connectivity through undersea cables.

International Cybersecurity Consequences
----------------------------------------

It is clear that Chinese telecommunications companies are increasing their global orientation and that international contracts may be politically expedient for the Chinese government and amenable to the needs of developing nations. However, many aspects of growing Chinese international activity are opaque. It is unclear how heavily Beijing weighs in on specific decisions, especially in the investment decisions of state-owned companies. The same lack of transparency regarding state and company relationship extends to Huawei Marine Systems, which essentially purchases its market share by offering extraordinarily cost-efficient installation prices. Since constructing submarine cables is often prohibitively expensive, it is a mystery how Huawei remains solvent. Huawei has repeatedly denied receiving subsidies from the government, although Western companies insist that Huawei does in fact receive illegal government assistance, and have been successful at blacklisting Huawei from certain projects in the West.

Concerns over Chinese telecommunications companies’ independence yield important political considerations. While Chinese investment may prove affordable and attractive, history dictates that reliance upon Chinese infrastructure can have deleterious and politically-motivated cybersecurity consequences – one need only consider the case of Vietnam, where Chinese investors have dominated both physical and digital infrastructure development. When Vietnam expressed its disapproval of China’s position on the South China Sea, Chinese investors froze cash flows to projects, leaving Vietnam in limbo. Chinese hackers have also exploited their knowledge of Vietnam’s airport systems – which were provided by the Chinese – to hack and suspend airport computers as well as airline websites. The confluence of extreme Chinese infrastructure dependence and politics in South Asia may not extend to other nations with which China is doing business, but sets a precedent that may leave the international community wary of Chinese partnerships.

Further yet, the Chinese government’s propensity for digital surveillance leaves one questioning the supposedly apolitical nature of increased global cable development. Even if the Chinese aren’t building backdoors into their cables now, they certainly have the potential to do so in the future, and the blurry line between private companies and state interest render cables increasingly accessible to Beijing.","The article discusses 'submarine cables' and 'undersea cables' extensively, focusing on Chinese investments and their implications for cybersecurity and international relations.

The map, by telecom analytics company Telegeography, uses coloured lines to show how there are many hundreds of fibre optic cables running under the world's oceans.

It shows the sheer scale of the infrastructure which keeps the internet running. It's built up over decades, mainly as a result of private enterprise rather than coordinated state infrastructure projects, like road or water networks.

Lines shown on the map above are not exactly geographically correct, but they show the broad path of the cables and which territories they connect.

If Russia were to cut the cables many countries could go offline.

According to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, 97 per cent of all intercontinental data is carried via such cables.

Although they are of obvious strategic importance to the countries involved, relatively little is done to guard them. In recent months, defence authorities have started to warn that state aggressors — Russia in particular — could cut them.

A US admiral, one of Britain's most senior military commanders, the former head of GCHQ and a London-based think-tank all made similar warnings in a matter of days late last year.

Rishi Sunak, a Conservative MP, produced a report for the Policy Exchange think-tank in which he warned that Russia is ""aggressively operating"" in the Atlantic, where cables link Europe and the US.

In the foreword to the report, retired US Navy Admiral James Stavridis claimed: ""Russian submarine forces have undertaken detailed monitoring and targeting activities in the vicinity of North Atlantic deep-sea cable infrastructure.""

He said they have the capacity to make a concentrated hit, causing ""potentially catastrophic"" damage.

Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, the UK's most senior military officer, gave a speech in December in which he said: ""There is a new risk to our way of life, which is the vulnerability of the cables that criss-cross the seabeds.

""Can you imagine a scenario where those cables are cut or disrupted, which would immediately and potentially catastrophically affect both our economy and other ways of living.""

At the start of December, former GCHQ director Robert Hannigan told The Times newspaper: ""In hybrid warfare you could tweak the UK economy, even without bringing it to its knees, by just cutting a few fibre-optic cables.""

""It could slow things down and with automated trading you could make life pretty difficult if you wanted to without going for full conflict.""

Russia has responded to the threat by suggesting it is not serious. Its embassy in London ran a Twitter poll in response to the Times interview, where most respondents seemed not to take the prospect seriously.","The article discusses the strategic importance of undersea cables and explicitly mentions the risk of Russia cutting them.

It highlights concerns from military officials regarding potential disruptions and their catastrophic effects on economies and connectivity.

This aligns well with the criterion of discussing cut sea cables in detail, including implications and risks."

CAIRO (Reuters) - A breakdown in an international undersea cable network disrupted Internet links to Egypt, India and Gulf Arab countries on Wednesday, and Egypt said it could take several days for its services to return to normal.

India's Internet service was disrupted by up to 60 percent because of a breakdown in an international undersea cable network, the Internet Service Providers' Association of India said.

It was not immediately possible to gauge the impact of the disruption on financial institutions. Egypt’s telecoms ministry said 70 percent of the country’s Internet network was down and India initially said it had lost over half its bandwidth.

“This cut has affected Internet services in Egypt with a partial disruption of 70 percent of the network nationwide,” the Egyptian ministry said in a statement.

Residents of Gulf Arab countries also reported a slowdown in Internet connectivity. The Bahrain Telecommunications Co said its services were affected after two undersea cables were cut near Alexandria, on Egypt’s north coast.

The Egyptian telecoms ministry said it did not know how the cables were cut or if weather was a factor. Storms had forced Egypt to close the northern mouth of the Suez canal on Tuesday.

India also reported serious disruptions to its services and Rajesh Chharia, president of the Internet Service Providers’ Association of India, told Reuters: “There has been a 50 to 60 percent cut in bandwidth.”

Chharia told the Headlines Today news channel that a “degraded” service would be up and running by Wednesday night, but full restoration would take 10 to 15 days.

One Indian Internet service provider affected by the cut, Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL), said its service had been “largely restored” by diverting to another cable. Two outsourcing firms in Bangalore reported minimal disruption.

Egypt said its call centres saw their services cut by more than 30 percent, and two Egyptian stockbrokers said market transactions were considerably slower and some international trading orders could not go through.

In Cairo, much of the capital city was without access to the Internet for the bulk of the day, frustrating businesses and the professions. “I can’t do anything because I manage all my work by e-mail. It is very frustrating,” said Egyptian lawyer Rebecca Mikhail. “As soon as I came in (to work) at 10 a.m. I didn’t have access to the Internet ... If it goes into the next working week it is going to be a nightmare.”","The article titled ""Internet services in Egypt and India disrupted"" discusses a significant disruption caused by a breakdown in an international undersea cable network.

The incident has interrupted voice and data services between Singapore and Indonesia for more than a month and inflicted more damage on the company’s afflicted finances.

Indosat’s backbone transmission division head Syafnedi said on Friday that the company found the broken undersea cables around Mapur Island, Bintan, Riau Islands province, when it investigated the disruption on its communications between Jakarta and Singapore.

The company then reported its findings to local police.

""We needed Rp 10 billion only to fix the cables. That excludes other stolen materials and losses. Now the situation is back to normal,"" he told reporters in Batam.

""These broken cables have caused us major losses as the voice, data, and internet connections were disrupted for more than a month, from early May until now.""

No figures of losses the company had suffered from disturbed operations are available.

Indosat representatives in Jakarta did not immediately respond to calls and text messages made by The Jakarta Post.

According to Syafnedi, the undersea cables, which were set up in the 1990s, were made of fiber optic comprising steel fibers and other materials.

Riau Police chief Brig. Gen. Endjang Hidayat said the police had secured 418 tons of undersea cables cut into several parts, 12 trucks, one excavator, five boats and diving equipment.

He added that the police had arrested two fences and five divers, all of whom had been named suspects. The suspects are Syamsuri, 32, Awaluddin, 33, Ali Mahmud, 43, Herman, 51, and Nasruddin, 45, while the two fences were Riki, 22, and Edy, 29.

""It’s a theft case. There’s no indication of sabotaging telecommunications between Indonesia and Singapore,"" Endjang said.

According to Endjang, the suspects allegedly stole the cables from September 2012 until this June at the depth of 30 to 40 meters.

The suspects will be charged with article 363 on theft and face maximum punishment of seven years if found guilty.

Indosat, a publicly listed company, is poised to keep booking losses in the second quarter of the year due to continued downward pressure from foreign exchange and depreciation.

Indosat recorded Rp 71 billion losses in the first quarter largely due to foreign exchange losses, changes in the calculation of depreciation value and high tower leasing costs.

This first quarter loss is 214.4 percent higher than that suffered in the same period last year.

The company also has to pay Rp 4 trillion in debts this year, approximately Rp 1.8 billion of which has been paid in the first semester with internal cash.

Indosat also reported that cellular subscriptions increased 7.4 percent year-on-year to 55.9 million as of the first quarter of 2013, while average revenue per user (ARPU) rose 5.9 percent to Rp 26,500.

However, quarter-to-quarter wise, the number of cellular subscribers decreased 4.4 percent while ARPU fell 1.1 percent. Indosat’s former chief commercial officer Erik Meijer attributed the quarterly decrease to ""seasonality.""

Indosat shares, traded under the code ISAT, closed at Rp 5,250 on Friday, up 2.94 percent.","The article titled ""Indosat spends Rp 10 billion replacing stolen underwater cable"" from The Jakarta Post discusses the theft of undersea cables by Indosat, which is central to the topic of cut sea cables.

Two incidents involving submarine communication cables in the Baltic Sea have caused significant concern not only among major telecom providers but also within governments. On 29 November, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the UN agency for digital technology, and the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC), a leading industry organisation supporting submarine cable protection, established the International Advisory Board on Submarine Cable Resilience. This occurred on the same day the restoration of damaged submarine cables was announced. Why such activity, considering cable damage is relatively common—up to 200 incidents occur annually worldwide? The answer likely lies in Russia’s suspected targeting of EU and NATO undersea infrastructure, with the two recent incidents in the Baltic Sea strongly resembling acts of sabotage.

The events of 18 November in the Baltic Sea were suspicious enough to dismiss accidental causes for the submarine cable damage. Resilience experts typically identify three common causes of such incidents: negligence by fishing vessels, improper anchoring, and natural factors, including ageing equipment and natural disasters. However, the cases involving cables connecting Germany with Finland and Lithuania with Sweden were far more intriguing. As of writing, the Chinese vessel Yi Peng 3, suspected of causing the damage, remains anchored in the Kattegat Strait under surveillance by Swedish and Danish naval ships. According to monitoring data, the ship had travelled from Russia’s Ust-Luga port, reportedly heading towards Egypt’s Port Said, although its ultimate destination could be different.

**Suspicious Circumstances**

The Yi Peng 3 is a bulk carrier, measuring 225 metres long with a carrying capacity of approximately 40,000 tonnes. If the vessel’s anchor was mishandled, it managed to damage two critical submarine cables simultaneously—a highly unlikely feat.

The Swedish government has issued inquiries to China and is pressing for the vessel to dock at a local port to facilitate investigations. So far, Beijing has not responded to the incident. Interestingly, similar incidents occurred in autumn 2023 and 2022.

On 8 October 2023, submarine cables connecting Estonia to Finland and Sweden were damaged. There were substantiated suspicions that this was not an accident but deliberate interference, coinciding with the presence of only Chinese and Russian ships in the area.

On 21 October 2022, cables in the strait between Scotland and the Shetland Islands were damaged. The suspected saboteur was Russia’s so-called research vessel Akademik Boris Petrov. Initially, the ship’s declared route was from the Baltic Sea through the English Channel to the Atlantic Ocean, en route to South America. However, it deviated significantly, taking a more northern route past British naval bases. A Dutch naval vessel, HNLMS Tromp, intercepted and escorted the Russian vessel out of British waters.

These incidents tend to occur in late autumn, around Western Europe. This timing coincides with the onset of harsh weather, complicating repair efforts, providing a logical explanation for the seasonal pattern.

**Defending Communication Infrastructure**

Submarine cable networks are the backbone of global telecommunications. According to the ITU, approximately 99% of global data traffic relies on these channels. ""More than 99% of international data exchange occurs via submarine cables, making their resilience a global imperative,"" said ITU Secretary-General Doreen Bogdan-Martin. ""The Advisory Board will mobilise global experts to ensure the resilience of this vital digital infrastructure against disasters, accidents, and other risks"", explained Bogdan-Martin.

The restoration of two Baltic Sea cables required ten days of intensive work and specialised equipment unavailable to the affected countries. This situation suggests hostile actors may be testing NATO’s ability to repair and protect cables through monitoring and patrolling. These challenges were a focal point of the “Cold Winds-24” military exercises in the Baltic Sea in late November, involving NATO 30 naval vessels.

The creation of the International Advisory Board on Submarine Cable Resilience is expected to draw greater attention to the issue. While Doreen Bogdan-Martin mentioned ""other causes"" of cable damage in her remarks, the ITU has not yet explicitly named the perpetrators. Perhaps this will change as national governments conduct more thorough investigations.","The article titled 'The Great Undersea Cable War' discusses various incidents involving submarine cables, particularly focusing on damage caused by suspected sabotage in the Baltic Sea.

It provides direct mentions of 'submarine cables' and 'cable damage', highlighting that these cables are crucial for global telecommunications, with approximately 99% of international data exchange occurring through them.

The article treats the topic as a central theme, analyzing the geopolitical implications of these incidents and responses from governments and organizations, such as the establishment of the International Advisory Board on Submarine Cable Resilience.

Jackson School of International Studies","**The Cybersecurity Implications of Chinese Undersea Cable Investment**

In 2013, BRICS business leaders announced plans to construct a $185 million submarine cable connecting Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. However, more than three years later, the BRICS cable has not come to fruition, presumably due to intra-bloc political differences and challenging domestic economic positions.

China is filling the vacuum left by the BRICS cable. Its companies are the most active investors and builders of submarine cables in the developing world. Between 2012 and 2015, Chinese companies were involved with only 7% of disclosed global submarine cable projects, and exclusively with projects that connected either to the Chinese Mainland, Taiwan, or Hong Kong. In contrast, between 2016 and 2019, Chinese companies participated in 20% of all cable construction projects, over half of which take place outside the South China Sea.

Chinese companies lag behind only the French company Alcatel-Lucent and the Swiss-owned TE Connectivity in total future submarine cable project activity. While Alcatel and TE Connectivity have had decades to expand and engage with the global market, the market share gained by Chinese companies in a relatively short period of time may signal Chinese market dominance in the near future.

**Chinese Cable Consortiums and Construction Projects**

Chinese state-owned telecommunications companies are actively expanding their network of cable consortium partnerships. China Unicom, China Telecom, and China Mobile are three state-owned telecommunications providers listed as owners of the new SeaMeWe-5 cable connecting Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Whereas Chinese companies have traditionally participated only in projects that directly involving Chinese territory, Chinese companies are also investing beyond Asia; for example, China Unicom shares ownership of a cable connecting Cameroon and Brazil.

While state-owned companies join cable ownership consortiums, Huawei Marine Systems is installing multiple submarine cables throughout the world. A 2008 joint venture between the Chinese technology giant Huawei and the British company Global Marine Systems, Huawei Marine Systems is making headlines for its work in Africa. At AfricaCom 2016, Huawei announced plans to build eight new cable systems connecting the continent and upgrade two existing cables.

**China’s New Global Orientation in Political Context**

China’s rise as a formidable player in ICT development may stem from domestic business policy. Around 2015, the Chinese government gave its telecommunications companies permission to fully expand globally. Before, Chinese companies were more restricted in their global reach, although Huawei managed to participate in a few cable projects.

For example, Huawei’s involvement in Africa largely mirrors other investments in non-digital regional infrastructure, which increases China’s influence, helps foster new markets for Chinese goods, and provides Beijing with valuable access to natural resources and agriculture. In other words, sending Chinese telecoms abroad through ownership and construction contracts may ultimately fall in line with Beijing’s long-term political and economic goals.

**International Cybersecurity Consequences**

It is clear that Chinese telecommunications companies are increasing their global orientation and that international contracts may be politically expedient for the Chinese government and amenable to the needs of developing nations. However, many aspects of growing Chinese international activity are opaque. It is unclear how heavily Beijing weighs in on specific decisions, especially in the investment decisions of state-owned companies.

Concerns over Chinese telecommunications companies’ independence yield important political considerations. While Chinese investment may prove affordable and attractive, history dictates that reliance upon Chinese infrastructure can have deleterious and politically-motivated cybersecurity consequences. The confluence of extreme Chinese infrastructure dependence and politics in South Asia may not extend to other nations with which China is doing business, but sets a precedent that may leave the international community wary of Chinese partnerships.

Further yet, the Chinese government’s propensity for digital surveillance leaves one questioning the supposedly apolitical nature of increased global cable development. Even if the Chinese aren’t building backdoors into their cables now, they certainly have the potential to do so in the future, and the blurry line between private companies and state interest render cables increasingly accessible to Beijing.","The article discusses 'submarine cables' and 'undersea cables,' which are synonymous with 'cut sea cables.'

As a result, all traffic between Singapore and SEA-ME-WE 5’s Kuakata landing station is down.

On April 17th, BSCPLC had announced that maintenance was due to be undertaken on the cable, which would cause temporary interruption of internet service, although it remains unclear if this maintenance was responsible for the outage.

“My impression based on the report of a temporary outage followed by the current long term outage is that the cable experienced a shunt fault where water penetrated the polyethylene insulation. The repeaters were able short term to compensate but the electrical short grew over time and the connection to the very important Tuas CLS in Singapore was completely lost,” speculated Roderick Beck, who sells subsea capacity to carriers for United Cable Company.

According to local press reports, Bangladesh is still able to access 100 Gbps of capacity from the western portion of the cable, which travels through the Red Sea and the Mediterranean to Toulon, France.

However, SEA-ME-WE 5 is one of only two subsea cables that connect Bangladesh, the other being the much older SEA-ME-WE 4 cable.

SEA-ME-WE 5’s fault means Bangladesh has lost 1.7 Tbps of international capacity. SEA-ME-WE 4 provides 800 Gbps and terrestrial fibre links provide 2.7 Tbps.

Back of a napkin calculation means that the fault has reduced the country’s internet capacity by approximately a third.

BSCPLC gave a timeline of just two or three days to repair the fault, which Beck attributes to the proximity of the fault to supply depots and cable ships.

This is in stark contrast to the cuts seen in the Red Sea last month, for which repairs are still yet to commence due to the instability in that region.

The SEA-ME-WE 5 cable is supplied by NEC and ASN.

Repair work on the notorious AAG undersea cable has finished three days ahead of schedule.  

Vietnam’s millions of internet users can breathe a sigh of relief, with repair work on the Asia America Gateway (AAG) cable completed three days earlier than expected early on Sunday.  

The Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group (VNPT) had said earlier the work would continue until June 5. It said that internet connection in the country has resumed full service, meaning web surfers were no longer facing sluggish speed on international websites.  

The cable, notorious for frequent breakdowns, encountered a technical problem on May 22, and repair work began three days later. It was the second signal loss on the AAG cable so far this year, following a reset last January.  

Connected in November 2009, the $560-million AAG handles more than 60 percent of the country’s international internet traffic. The system runs more than 20,000 kilometers (12,420 miles), connecting Southeast Asia and the U.S., passing through Brunei, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.  

Since its debut, the cable has encountered a ‘very high’ risk of rupture and been under frequent repair, affecting all service providers in Vietnam and weakening confidence of domestic internet users.  

The cable suffered technical errors at least five times in 2017.  

Vietnam currently has six submarine cable systems, as well as a 120 gigabit channel that runs overland through China. With a download speed of 5.46 megabytes per second, Vietnam's internet speed was ranked 74th out of 189 countries and territories in a global survey of broadband speeds compiled by Cable.co.uk, a U.K. broadband, TV, phone and mobile provider, last August.  

Vietnam's average broadband speed was 10 times lower than its Southeast Asian neighbor Singapore, according to the survey. However, the country still managed to trump six other countries in the region.  

More than 50 million people in Vietnam, or more than half of the country’s population, are internet users.","The article discusses the repair of the AAG undersea cable, which is a direct reference to the topic of cut sea cables.

It mentions a technical problem that led to the need for repairs, which implies a disruption typically associated with cable cuts.

The article highlights the impact of these repairs on internet connectivity in Vietnam, noting that the cable handles over 60% of the country's international internet traffic.

India was badly affected by an internet blackout a few days ago. The south-east coast of India, especially Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, were badly hit by cyclone Vardah, which was the main reason for internet services being affected across the continent. Chennai is one of the major landing points for India’s undersea internet telecommunication links, and the cyclone caused significant damage to the undersea submarine cables.

The majority of internet flows through undersea cables, with very little passing through satellites. India receives its data connection from three major landing points: Mumbai, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala. Internet data reaches India through a network of undersea submarine fibre-optic cables owned by telecom giants such as Singtel, Etisalat, France Telecomm, and China Telecomm. These cables run across thousands of miles along the seabed, connecting different nations to the internet circuit.

When an undersea submarine fibre-optic cable is damaged, it needs to be repaired urgently, as many nations depend on these networks for data communication. Undersea cables are often damaged by earthquakes, ship anchors, and fishing trawls, necessitating repairs and maintenance.

Repairing a cable is akin to fixing a punctured tire, where the damaged rubber is replaced with a new patch. When a fibre-optic cable breaks in mid-sea, the fault cannot be seen directly. Therefore, the telecom operator must locate the accident and replace the damaged section with a new cable.

The first step involves the telecom operator pinpointing the damaged area by sending signal pulses through the cable from one end or base station. The break in the cable will cause the pulse to bounce back to the signaling site that sent the data. By calculating the time delay from the reflected signal, engineers can identify the exact location of the problem. A large cable repair ship is then dispatched with new optic cables to replace the defective section under the sea. The cable is lifted from the seabed using special hooks (grapnel) and brought on board the ship. The faulty cables are spliced onboard, joined with a new cable, sealed with watertight and anticorrosive covering, and then returned to the seabed. Afterward, the ship sends information to the base stations to test the cable again. Once the test signals reach their destination, the repair is confirmed, and the cable is successfully restored. The entire process can take up to 16 hours or more, depending on the number of breaks, successful repairs, time of day, weather conditions at sea, and the presence of other ships in the area.

Is vital internet infrastructure at risk from new Russian naval capabilities? NATO’s military leadership has warned in recent months that the Russian navy is aggressively probing undersea communications cable networks. These cables form a global infrastructure system that transmits 99 percent of the international data sent over the internet. Despite the ominous warnings, defense officials have not provided much specific information about the actual substance of the Russian threat.

In the worst scenario, an attack that cut submarine cables coming into the United States could significantly harm its access to the global internet. Ordinary users would probably experience massive losses in bandwidth, particularly for services such as Google and Facebook that host much of their data overseas. Since most government also relies on commercial internet infrastructure, the outages would also interrupt official communications.

Russia threatens undersea cables primarily with submarines and spy ships that deploy deep-sea submersibles. The most prominent Russian spy ship is the Yantar, which has been busy since it came into service in 2015. Underwater submersibles can damage cables, but it is uncertain whether they can tap cable communications underwater in the same way that human operatives can tap fiber-optic cables on land.

The Russian naval activity is probably not aimed solely at commercial communications cables but may also be directed at military underwater sensing equipment. Hundreds of cables criss-cross the oceans, providing connectivity that allows major data centers to operate efficiently. Each undersea cable transmits huge quantities of data, but the cable network has significant redundancy, making the impact of any single cable cut less severe than it would have been in the past.

In summary, the article outlines the potential threats posed by Russia to undersea cables, emphasizing the strategic importance of these cables and the implications of any damage to them.","The article discusses the potential threats posed by Russian naval activities to undersea cables, including direct mentions of the consequences of cutting submarine cables.

Expanding the EU’s role in the Indo-Pacific  
The rapid development of digital technologies has dramatically increased global internet bandwidth demand, with submarine cables today accounting for nearly 99% of intercontinental data traffic. These undersea cables are the backbone of global communications and the internet economy. Despite their critical importance, these cables remain inadequately protected, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region.

Globally, approximately 100-200 cases of damage to undersea cables are reported annually according to the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC). Most of these incidents are accidental, typically caused by fishing or anchoring. Physical protection measures, such as burial in shallow waters and electronic monitoring of anomalies, along with legal regulations, all contribute to cable security. However, much of the responsibility for protecting these cables lies with operators, limiting private-public cooperation and creating vulnerabilities, whether during times of peace, ‘grey zone’ situations or at moments of crisis. Ensuring seamless protection that spans from peacetime to periods of potential volatility remains a significant challenge.

The Indo-Pacific faces unique challenges in ensuring the security of its submarine cables. For the EU, whose interests in the region are framed by its 2021 Indo-Pacific Strategy, vulnerabilities related to this critical infrastructure pose a strategic risk, calling for more proactive measures.

**Europe's experience: Lessons from the Nord Stream incident**  
The sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines in September 2022 amid Russia’s war in Ukraine served as a wake-up call for Europe. It exposed the vulnerability of undersea infrastructure and underscored the urgent need to accelerate efforts to improve national and regional capabilities to collectively protect and repair critical subsea assets.

**Emerging challenges from China**  
Several trends involving China are raising concerns about the security of undersea cables in the Indo-Pacific and the EU’s interests in the region. Chinese companies are rapidly expanding their presence in the submarine cable construction and repair industry, raising security concerns under China’s National Intelligence Law of 2017.

**Regional responses and gaps**  
Regional coordination on submarine cable security in the Indo-Pacific has been fragmented, largely due to the lack of region-wide formal security institutions. The US, Japan, and Australia have taken the lead in countering these threats, but regional responses remain inadequate.

**The EU's role: Opportunities for greater engagement**  
The EU’s 2018 vision for connecting Europe and Asia, articulated through the Global Gateway initiative, and the EU-Japan Digital Partnership have laid some groundwork for addressing these challenges. However, the EU’s role in ensuring submarine cable security in the Indo-Pacific remains limited. One notable EU initiative is the Far North Fiber project, which aims to connect Europe and Japan via the Arctic, bypassing critical chokepoints in the South China and Red Seas.","The article titled 'The changing submarine cables landscape' discusses various aspects of submarine cables, which includes direct mentions of 'undersea cables' and 'submarine cables'.

It highlights the critical role these cables play in global communications and the internet economy, and it addresses the vulnerabilities and threats they face, including incidents of damage.

Vietnamese government officials said today that it will take at least a month to fix a critical undersea data cable damaged by fishermen scavenging for scrap copper.

The 560Mbit/sec. fiber-optic cable, which connects Vietnam with Hong Kong and Thailand, is one of two that provides the bulk of the country's connection with the Internet. Hanoi blamed the damage on fishermen, who pulled lines from the seabed thinking that they were copper cables laid by the U.S. or the former Republic of South Vietnam before 1975.

According to the state-run Viet Nam News (VNS) news service and Web site, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung has called on authorities to stop such thefts. At least five cases have been documented since January, VNS added, including the recent seizure of two fishing boats carrying about 80 tons of cable, which the fishermen intended to sell as scrap.

Today, VNS quoted Tran Duc Lai, the deputy minister of posts and telematics, saying that it would take at least 30 days to repair the fiber-optic cable. ""This is the first time that fishermen cut an undersea cable to sell as scrap,"" Lai told VNS. ""It is a serious threat to national security, socio-economic development, and Vietnam's international prestige.""

As much as 61 miles of cable must be replaced, said Lai.

Until the repair is completed, Vietnam's connection to the Internet depends on a 10Gbit/sec. cable that links the country to China, Hong Kong and Singapore.

""To prevent a repeat of the situation, we have to take urgent measures like increasing fishermen's awareness of the importance of underwater cables, increasing patrols in areas that have undersea cables, and stringent punishment for those violating the law,"" Lai said.

Last December, major earthquakes off the coast of Taiwan damaged several undersea cables and disrupted telephone and Internet service to and from China, Hong Kong, Singapore and other countries in the region. Most repairs were completed by the end of January.

Submarine cables and the internet traffic they carry, including as much as 99 percent of international telecommunications data, have been a focus area for government officials in recent months. In June 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned entities supporting Russia's ""underwater capabilities,"" citing concerns of Russian activity ""tracking undersea communication cables."" The sanctions shortly followed the re-establishment of a NATO command post tracking Russian submarines in December 2017, prompted by the same concerns of Russian activity near submarine cables.  

Australian officials have sounded similar alarms regarding control of submarine cables. Recently, the head of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) directly intervened in negotiations to prevent Chinese firm Huawei from receiving a contract to lay cable providing internet to the Solomon Islands, citing Chinese ownership of a cable connected to Australia's network infrastructure as an unacceptable cybersecurity risk. Ultimately, in a deal finalized in June 2018, Australia agreed to cover two thirds of the construction costs using foreign aid funds to ensure an Australian firm received the award.  

Despite security apprehensions regarding submarine cables, attempts to interfere with their infrastructure are blunted by a number of factors. For example, clandestinely intercepting data on cables would likely be impeded by physical constraints, network operators' ability to monitor for atypical activity and an inability to make use of intercepted data, as nearly three quarters of internet traffic is encrypted in transit.  

Cable breaks are a relatively common occurrence today, and as many as 100 breaks occur per year on average; two thirds of which are the result of accidents involving commercial vessels. A more realistic threat is disrupting internet access by intentionally severing the cables. While some officials have warned that such attacks could ""immediately and potentially catastrophically"" impact the economy, redundant infrastructure would also limit the effects of these accidents and attacks.  

There are instances in which cable breaks can have outsized impacts, including incidents of simultaneous cable breaks or breaks within regions lacking redundant infrastructure. In 2006, an earthquake simultaneously severed eight cables off the coast of Taiwan, resulting in the loss of 90 percent of the data traffic between China, the U.S. and Europe. Similarly, in an incident in 2008, two cables carrying 90 percent of internet traffic through the Suez Canal were broken, obstructing internet access for 75 million people across North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia.  

Given the global nature of the maritime industry, and the need for offices and shoreside IT infrastructure, maritime organizations may be particularly vulnerable to disruptions of limited infrastructure serving isolated regions. While private sector organizations may have little control over nation-state activities targeting submarine cables, they can factor disruptive risks stemming from cable breaks, intentional or accidental, into decisions regarding the IT infrastructure used at sites around the world.  

To mitigate the impact of submarine cable breaks, companies can conduct assessments with their network carriers to identify sites in regions that lack cable redundancy. To prevent any incidents from occurring, companies can lease more fiber, engage with a separate ISP for backup or ensure critical data at sites without redundant connectivity are backed-up at facilities in other regions.

It will take three weeks to repair the damage. In the meantime, the Internet in Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Juba, the capital of South Sudan, is functioning at a reduced speed. It will impede the normal flow by about 20 percent, according to the BBC's Nairobi correspondent, Noel Mwakugu.

The Indian Ocean East Africa Marine Systems (TEAMS) cable, which connects East Africa to the United Arab Emirates, was severed when a ship dropped anchor in a restricted area – restricted because of the presence of the sea cabling. The Teams cable was carrying redirected traffic from the earlier cutting of three other cables in the Red Sea, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The outage comes at a time when Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, has assumed a much greater profile as a center of technological innovation and entrepreneurship, largely due to the recent availability of fast, reliable broadband connections. These undersea fiber-optic cables, laid in 2009 and which connect Africa to the world, have kicked off Kenya's high-tech industry and prompted an increase in Kenyan Internet users from 1.8 million to 3.1 million in the first year.

Bitenge Ndemo, Kenya's permanent secretary in the Ministry of Information and Communications, says that the cost of the internet outage could reach $500 million by the time repairs are finished.

""We do not have the cost yet but it runs into millions of dollars since TEAMS and EASSY carry almost 70 percent of the traffic from the East African Region,"" Mr. Ndemo told the Monitor. ""Most providers had cut off satellite thinking we have sufficient redundancy,"" Ndemo adds, and the Kenyan government has urged other new cable lines to land elsewhere to prevent future line cuts in the high-traffic sea-lanes outside Mombasa.

In the meantime, Kenya's losses have been significant. ""There have been major disruptions and loss of revenue in the past few days,"" Ndemo says. ""In my estimation we shall have lost up to $500 million by the time we are reconnected.""

Jessica Colaço, the manager of iHub, a high-tech incubator in Nairobi, estimates that the cut in Internet service will affect an estimated 10,000 people in Nairobi who work in the tech industry. All of those people, along with larger companies who have started to locate in the city -- such as Google, Microsoft, and Samsung -- will suffer the frustration of a substantial slow-down until the cable is repaired.

In addition to work taking longer, and therefore costing more, a slowing in the rate of information carried online could also cause multiple websites and online services to ""time out."" A time out is a limit on the duration allowed for an online instruction to be followed and is configured on a server-by-server or client-by-client basis. A time out will require a user to begin the process of retrieval again (and again). In many cases, users will never access the information at all, bringing work to a standstill for the duration of the repair.

“It is difficult to make an exact analysis [of the effects], because one cannot be sure about the amount of redundancy that is built into most of the operator networks to deal with something like this,” Paul Kukubo, CEO of Kenya’s ICT Board, said by email. “As we write this I am able to communicate because my service provider obviously has another network to route through.

“But the visible effects are that there has been a considerable slowdown on some Internet network speeds. Some service providers have been affected in terms of quality due to this, especially because the TEAMS networks provide high speed broadband that many have come to depend on. We have seen some slowdown on some government networks as well,” Mr. Kukubo said. “The providers assure us that this is a rare occurrence and because East Africa has 3 cable connections, and one was unaffected by the cut, we are lucky to have this redundancy on our undersea cables.”

Computer users are used to the Internet malfunctioning, of course. But for most, malfunctions rarely can be traced to a single act of negligence, or greed, by a named individual. The Mombasa anchor episode, in this sense, resembles an incident in which an Armenian retiree in the Caucasian nation of Georgia brought down the Internet. Hayastan Shakarian, a retiree living in Georgia, wound up cutting the connection to three Caucasian countries with a shovel while searching for copper wiring to steal in the hills.

As with the shovel incident, the Mombasa anchor incident is an unwelcome reminder that the high-minded world of technology remains vulnerable to physical human error.

Underwater data cables linking East Africa to the Middle East and Europe have been severed, bringing transfer rates to their knees in nine countries.  
  
In a bizarre coincidence, a ship allegedly dropped anchor off the coast of Kenya on Saturday in a restricted area, cutting The East African Marine Systems (TEAMS) cable - shortly after three other cables were chopped in the Red Sea between Djibouti and the Middle East, the _Wall Street Journal_ reported.  
  
TEAMS was already stuffed with the traffic from the other three cables, the Europe India Gateway (EIG), the South East Asia Middle East Western Europe-3 (SMW-3) and the Eastern Africa Submarine Cable System (EASSY), which were severed ten days before.  
  
""It's a very unusual situation,"" Chris Wood, chief executive of West Indian Ocean Cable, the largest shareholder of the EASSY, and a major owner of data-capacity rights on the two other Red Sea cables. ""I believe these were accidental incidents, although more will be known when we bring the cables up from the sea bed.""  
  
Naturally, the number of cables ruined in a short timeframe has sparked suspicions of sabotage. A source from African carrier Airtel told Ugandan independent newspaper the _Daily Monitor_ that the cables had been sliced on purpose.  
  
""The EASSY and TEAMS cables were cut by malicious people at the weekend and this is causing connection problems. All internet providers, particularly Orange and Airtel have been affected because they all depend on these cables for service provision,” he said.  
  
Wood told the _WSJ_ that the cables in the Red Sea had all been severed at the same time, around 650 feet below the Red Sea, but he said that a passing ship could have done the damage because the sea is so shallow.  
  
He added that these cables should be fixed in the next three weeks.  
  
Joel Tanui, general manager of the TEAMS cable, gave the same timescale for fixes to that cable.  
  
""We wish to notify all our stakeholders of ongoing emergency repair works and apologise unreservedly for any inconvenience this may cause,"" he said. ""The cable should be fully operational within the next three weeks.""

BERLIN — Chinese scientists have been researching ways to cut undersea cables since at least the late 2000s, according to a recent report in the U.S. magazine Newsweek. The revelation comes amid a series of events in which undersea infrastructure in geopolitically tense regions was damaged under unclear circumstances.  
  
Reporters at Newsweek uncovered two patent applications Chinese researchers filed for towed undersea cable-cutting devices and associated methods to inflict such damage.  
  
The patent applications, which the magazine reported were both ultimately dropped for unknown reasons, show devices shaped similarly to anchors that are meant to be dragged along the ocean floor to dig up and sever undersea cables.  
  
There is a striking similarity to recent events of purported sabotage of undersea cables by ostensibly civilian vessels dragging their anchors along the seabed. This happened in the Baltic Sea, severing communications and data transfer cables. It has also recently occurred close to Taiwan. The island, which has governed itself ever since the Chinese Civil War, is claimed by Beijing as part of China. President Xi Jinping has made it clear that annexation – or reunification, as Beijing calls it – is a central policy of his term.  
  
Policymakers and experts have called these incidents acts of “hybrid warfare” and sabotage.  
  
The more recent of the two patent applications was developed in 2020 by a group of engineers from Lishui University. The institution is located in Zhejiang province, just across the strait from Taiwan. The invention was filed as a “dragging type submarine cable cutting device.” Newsweek quoted the document’s authors as saying that “with the development of science and technology, more and more submarine cables and communication cables are laid on the seabed of all parts of the world and the cables need to be cut off in some emergency situations.”  
  
The magazine also discovered an application from a coastal research institution in the south of China from 2009 for a similar device. That application referenced the need to be able to counteract “illegal” cables off Chinese shores, a purported use case that experts dismissed as being highly unlikely.  
  
In response to the story, the Chinese embassy in D.C. told Newsweek that “the Chinese government had always welcomed and supported other countries and telecommunications companies laying international submarine cables in waters under China’s jurisdiction.” The spokesperson said China would “continue to work with the international community to actively promote the construction of global information infrastructure such as submarine cables, jointly protect submarine cables, and work together to build a community with a shared future in cyberspace.”  
  
As a knock-on effect of the global geopolitical instability precipitated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, undersea infrastructure has become an area of focus and concern. In the Baltic Sea, countries are stepping up countermeasures after Chinese-owned ships operating out of Russian ports were involved in several incidents where pipelines and cables were damaged by dragged anchors.  
  
It is unclear to what extent the Chinese government was involved in recent cable-cutting incidents involving apparently civilian ships in the Baltic Sea. In at least one of the incidents, the Chinese government has publicly called the event an “accident.”  
  
Experts have also voiced concern that as part of Beijing’s pressure tactics surrounding Taiwan, attacks on undersea infrastructure could be used as a gray-zone, hybrid-warfare tactic.  
  
Linus Höller is a Europe correspondent for Defense News. He covers international security and military developments across the continent. Linus holds a degree in journalism, political science and international studies, and is currently pursuing a master’s in nonproliferation and terrorism studies.","The article discusses Chinese scientists' research into cutting undersea cables, particularly highlighting two patent applications for devices designed to sever these cables.

It details the geopolitical context of undersea cable damage, citing specific incidents in the Baltic Sea and near Taiwan, where undersea infrastructure has been compromised.

The implications for internet connectivity and the characterization of these actions as acts of 'hybrid warfare' further emphasize the article's focus on the topic of cut sea cables.

At its peak, CyberBunker clogged up a mind-boggling 300 gigabits per second of the Internet in what’s being called the biggest cyber-attack in history. But what if you could switch off 1.28 terabits—four times as much bandwidth—with nothing more high-tech than an axe?

That’s what three men tried to do in an unsophisticated but effective form of sabotage in Egypt yesterday; their identities and motives are not yet known. Reuters reports the Egyptian coastguard intercepted a fishing boat off the coast of Alexandria and arrested three men trying to cut through the SEA-ME-WE 4 undersea cable. The cable is one of the main connections between Asia and Europe, running from France to Malaysia and linking Italy, north Africa, the middle east and south Asia. The men, whose pictures the navy uploaded on Facebook, are being interrogated by Egyptian authorities.

The Internet does not live in anything resembling a cloud, as Andrew Blum memorably put it in Tubes, his book about the net’s physical infrastructure. Instead it resides in hundreds of cables snaking underground and along the bottom of the sea, where it is susceptible to ship anchors, marine life, and sabotage.

Most big countries have several redundant cables landing on their shores. But the loss of even a single one means that all the traffic must be jammed through remaining connections, causing congestion. And there is nothing to stop determined attackers from targeting several cables. Indeed, since many cables go through geographic chokepoints like the Suez, it wouldn’t be difficult to disrupt a whole bunch of connections in a brief period of time.

That’s exactly the kind of attack that seems to be underway. The past week saw reports of several severed cables off the coast of Egypt that are part of Seacom, a network of cables serving much of Africa. At the time, Seacom officials suspected careless ships. But the arrest of the three men yesterday suggests there could a concerted effort to take down Egypt’s connectivity. A similar spate of cuts affected the region in 2008, though no culprit was officially established.

Yesterday’s attacks on the Internet’s infrastructure—Cyberbunker and the Egyptian cable—show two ways of waging asymmetric war in the Internet era. If your aim is a single company, it helps to know how to wrangle thousands of zombie computers into a precise, targeted attack. That also has the benefit of allowing regular users—and the attackers themselves—to stay online. But if your target is bigger, say a country or a continent, all it takes to cripple the network is scuba gear and a few sharp-edged tools.","The article discusses the SEA-ME-WE 4 undersea cable and an incident where individuals attempted to cut it.

I’m glad to see that some news sites featured my post and that people are starting to take a critical look at what is happening.

That being said, I’m sure that everyone is eager to read the results of my findings on why these cables may have been damaged, who has to gain from the damages, and where we, as concerned citizens, should start to look for answers.

Before I begin, I would like to point out that these findings are from my own research. I am not accusing anyone of anything here. I am simply providing a resource for the rest of the internet so that people can start to investigate what may really be happening over there. There are some facts out there that are just too big to ignore.

We have been told by various organizations that these damages are attributed to power failures or by an anchor being accidentally dragged along the ocean floor during a storm. However, it doesn’t take more than a 5th grade education to start to recognize that there may, in fact, be a pattern to what we are seeing here.

### **#4 – Big Telecom Companies**  
In talking to a network operations manager about the damages that have been done to the cables, the first companies that he suggested, which stand to gain from this type of damage, are the larger telecommunications companies. Especially the land-based ones.

So, which companies have some ties into this mess? Well, there are a few companies that popped up while doing my research. However, for the scope of this article, let’s look at Verizon Business. To start things off, Verizon partially owns the SeaMeWe-4 cable that was severed.

### **#3 – December 2007**  
In December of 2007, there were a few events that occurred related directly to the damages that we have recently seen.

### **#2 – Reliance Communications and FLAG**  
First of all, you need to understand that Reliance Communications is part of a massive company that, grouped with Reliance Telecom and Flag Telecom, makes up Reliance Communications Ventures.

### **#1 – The Iranian Oil Bourse**  
Through the research that I have exhaustingly done over the past few days, this is the one that has struck me as the most likely reason for the damages that have occurred to submarine internet cables.","The article discusses submarine cables extensively, including direct mentions of damages to these cables and the implications for telecommunications companies.

It describes how damage to submarine cables affects internet connectivity and examines potential motivations behind these incidents.

The focus on submarine cables is central to the article, fulfilling the criterion for being on the topic of cut sea cables."

**Published Date:** 07/25/2024  
**Author:** Ben Roberts  

On 12 May 2024, two fiber optic submarine cables—SEACOM and EASSy—were damaged off the coast of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, significantly reducing Internet connectivity in multiple East African countries. The cause of the damage is a suspected dragging ship anchor, a common source of submarine cable cuts.

All cables were repaired as of 3 June 2024—approximately three weeks after the initial damage.

This report highlights the impact of these submarine cable cuts on local connectivity and the importance of developing resilience to maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of such faults.

#### The Importance of Submarine Cables

Fibre optic submarine cables are critical communication infrastructures that form the backbone of international Internet connectivity. Currently, around 559 submarine cable systems span 1.5 million kilometers, connecting the smallest Pacific islands to the largest economies of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.

In 2009, the first submarine fiber cables were activated on East Africa’s coast, providing an alternative to satellite connectivity to many countries in the sub-region. Not only did these cables reduce latency in the sub-region by 400%, but they also reduced Internet costs by more than 50%.

Since then, five more submarine fiber cables have been commissioned to connect East African countries south of Kenya.

While these submarine cables predominantly benefit the countries that connect directly to them via coastal landing stations, neighboring landlocked countries also benefit via terrestrial cross-border fiber connections.

Table 1 shows the submarine cables and terrestrial cross-border cables that provide connectivity to each country in the sub-region.

#### The Importance of IXPs

An IXP is a physical place where different networks interconnect and send traffic to one another. This is known as peering and is part of what makes Internet services faster, more reliable, and cheaper.

IXPs also provide insight into local traffic connectivity. The more networks connect at an IXP, the more insight an IXP has. The following graphs show the daily local Internet traffic being routed by IXPs in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda in the lead-up to and following the 12 May cable outage.

The Internet Society has carried out many activities to support the establishment and growth of IXPs in the countries affected by this outage. These activities have included training workshops, equipment donations, cache fill grants, and hosting peering forums to promote the local Internet ecosystem and strengthen the local technical community.

#### The Importance of Redundancy and Cooperation

The Internet is designed so that when one route does not work, traffic can be automatically rerouted via another. The more routes to and from destinations, the greater the redundancy when one route is affected, and the less likely users will be affected or notice any performance issues.

Using BGPlay, we can playback the outage and see how traffic was rerouted for networks in Tanzania. While IXPs and CDN caches help to offset the impact of international cable outages, the events of 12 May highlighted the level of international connectivity redundancy that countries have in the region.

"Damage to Fourth Undersea Cable Sparks Conspiracy Theories","Examines the effects of undersea cable damage on global connectivity, linking it to conspiracy theories surrounding the incidents.","https://callcenterinfo.tmcnet.com/analysis/articles/20044-damage-fourth-undersea-cable-sparks-conspiracy-theories.htm","2008-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","By Erik Linask - Group Editorial Director",Yes,"Erik Linask","Shelton, Connecticut, United States","20000","2008-02-05","English","TMCnet","**Damage to Fourth Undersea Cable Sparks Conspiracy Theories**  
February 05, 2008  
When three undersea cables providing connectivity in the Middle East and westward to Europe and North America were cut last week in the Middle East, the impact was immediate — and significant — as many with connections in the region were shut off from Internet communications. That meant VoIP service, IM, and email were suddenly unavailable.  
Now, repair work has begun on one of the three severed cables, with a second repair vessel expected to begin servicing a second line imminently, with hopes that service to the Middle East and Asia would soon be restored.  
Sunday, however, a fourth cable connecting Qatar and the UAR has also been cut, though apparently for a different reason. The first three, in the Mediterranean Sea and Persian Gulf, are said to have been severed by dragging anchors — though various reports claim that explanation has been retracted by the Egyptian Transport Ministry.  
According to the Ministry’s official report, “The Ministry’s Maritime Transport Committee reviewed footage covering the period of 12 hours before and 12 hours after the cables were cut, and no ships sailed the area. The area is also marked on maps as a no-go zone, and it is, therefore, ruled out that the damage to the cables was caused by shipping.”  
The fourth cable has reportedly been shut down due to power issues, which are expected to take several days to repair.  
With four cables now having been damaged in a week in the region, and particularly with the latest statement from the Ministry, speculation is running rampant as to whether the damage is a result of international sabotage. Reports claim a variety of sources that might have incapacitated the cables, from the U.S. Secret Service, to Islamic fundamentalists, or other military exercises. Others maintain the damage signifies retribution for the impending opening of the Iranian Oil Bourse, which will allow trading in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, potentially diminishing the value of the dollar.  
Clearly, the political impact, should the damage be attributed to military or financially motivated activity, poses severe implications, but apart from that, the mere impact on broadband connectivity within the region, and communications capabilities with Europe and North America have already been hampered, causing significant disruption to workflows at many businesses.  
“This has been an eye-opener for the telecom industry worldwide,” said According to Colonel R.S. Parihar, Secretary of the Internet Service Providers Association of India. “Today, the cause of the problem might have been an anchor, but what if it is sabotage tomorrow? These are owned by private operators, and there are no governments or armies protecting these cables.”  
Indeed, submarine cables carry nearly all global Internet and phone traffic — largely because it is considerably cheaper that satellite transmission — and further damage, or an inability to effectively repair the already disabled lines, could pose a significant impact on not only the global business community, which has come to rely heavily on IP-based communications.  
If the damage is, indeed, found to be accidental, the service disruptions, if nothing else, underscore the need to carrier network redundancies, which providers like VSNL have already taken to heart. VSNL was able to restore service to the majority of its Middle Eastern customers by virtue of its bi-directional backbone, which circles the globe, allowing eastward connectivity, should westward connections go down, as they did this past week.

### Abstract  
The objective of the paper is to develop a robust and reliable method to pinpoint submarine cable faults. Submarine cables have existed for over 100 years but there is still no single method used to determine the precise location of a submarine cable fault. The various methods used to pinpoint cable faults, both submarine and non-submarine, were researched and investigated to produce a method which would accurately pinpoint submarine cable faults. From this, the idea of a hydrophone string was derived from a non-submarine pinpointing method currently used. The hydrophone string was tested and it accurately pinpointed the location of the cable fault.  

### I. Introduction  
Submarine cables have varied roles over the years, initially supplying power to lighthouses and now supporting offshore renewable energy resources and connecting islands. Despite being designed to withstand harsh marine conditions, faults occur due to human activities or natural events like storms and earthquakes.  

### II. Submarine Cable Faults  
The majority of cable damage is attributed to human activities such as fishing and anchoring, alongside natural disasters. Understanding these causes is crucial for developing effective fault location methods.  

This article provides insights into the challenges of locating submarine cable faults and emphasizes the need for efficient repair strategies to minimize downtime and costs.","The article discusses submarine cables and their faults, directly addressing the topic of cut sea cables.

It explores the causes of cable damage, including human activities and natural disasters, and emphasizes the importance of accurately locating these faults to minimize repair costs and restore power.

This central theme aligns well with the criterion regarding cut sea cables."

If you’ve never read Neal Stephenson’s epic article from Wired magazine in 1996 about the laying of undersea fiber optic cable, I highly recommend you set aside some time to do so. Just a warning: set aside a lot of time. The article is almost book length, and it’s hard to stop reading once you get into it. He goes into quite a lot of detail about FLAG, the Fiberoptic Link Around the Globe. 

You’ll learn quite a bit about undersea cables and FLAG, which could come in handy, because in the last week, it appears that a bunch of these undersea cables have all started experiencing problems. It started off with reports of two cut cables (one of which is FLAG’s) in the Mediterranean, with the explanation being that a boat anchor dragged across them. Yet, late Friday, reports came in of a third cut cable (also a FLAG cable) in the Persian Gulf, followed by Egyptian reports denying that the cuts were caused by ships, saying none were in the area. 

To top that off, on Sunday, reports came in of a fourth cable with problems in the Middle East (it’s unclear if this problem is as serious as a full cut cable), causing people to start thinking up conspiracy theories. 

It certainly is mighty strange to have four separate undersea cables with such problems in the same region within a few days of each other. You hate to ascribe it to malice without further evidence, but unless these cables all just went off of warranty, it’s going to have a lot of folks asking similar questions.","The article titled ""Did The Warranties Just Run Out On Undersea Cables?"" discusses multiple instances of undersea cables being cut, particularly focusing on two cables in the Mediterranean and a third in the Persian Gulf, all related to incidents involving a boat anchor.

It is 3AM at Social Graph Foo Camp and it seems conversations about data portability and authentication will continue until breakfast. As I was leaving to find my sleeping bag, several people insisted that sharing conspiracy theories about the three recent transcontinental fiber cuts was of greater importance than my own desire to sleep. Here goes…  

It’s no secret that many governments tap undersea communications lines to install surveillance systems. One theory is that the cuts, initially reported as being caused by ships anchoring in rough seas, are actually a diversion to cover taps installed by a special submarine hundreds of miles away or by the repair ships themselves.  

The USS Jimmy Carter is an example of a United States submarine equipped for this kind of mission, although other nations probably have this capability too. If such a submarine were doing this, it seems unlikely that it would cause such massive interruptions. The whole point would be to do this covertly and so interruption would be momentary if it were noticed at all. More importantly, a tap is useless when the lines are out-of-service.  

If the outages are intentional I suspect that there is something else going on.  

(Updated: Feb-04 12:30 PST) I’ve edited this post and removed the “lolsub”. These theories are getting more attention after Egypt retracted an earlier statement about this being caused by ships and a fourth cable had problems.

Under the waves at the bottom of the Earth’s oceans are almost 1.5 million kilometers of submarine fiber optic cables. Going unnoticed by most everyone in the world, these cables underpin the entire global internet and our modern information age.  
  
Worldwide telecommunications began somewhere around 150 years ago, in 1850, with the first commercial international submarine cable between England and France. A few years later, by 1858, the first trans-Atlantic telegraph cable connected London with North America when 143 words were transmitted in about 10 hours.  
  
Today, the United States’ financial and military command systems rely on global submarine cables. Trillions of dollars of daily transactions mean the entire global economy depends on submarine cables. Access to information for people around the world is dependent on submarine cables.  
  
The infrastructure underpinning this incredible advancement in the transfer, availability, and access to information around the world is made almost entirely of submarine telecommunications cables running hundreds or thousands of meters below the waves on the ocean floor.

The submarine cables that move internet traffic around the world are made from silica glass fiber optic strands. However, submarine cables need to allow light to travel very long distances with minimal attenuation, so the G.654 subset of fiber is used for undersea applications.  
  
Low attenuation is important since crossing oceans means light will be traveling considerable distances. G.654 compliant fibers have a zero-dispersion wavelength at about 1300nm and are optimized for use in the 1500 nm-1600 nm range.  
  
Most submarine cables are powered with about 20k volts from both ends. Each power source powers half of the inline amplifiers.  
  
Cable faults rarely occur due to marine life, such as shark bites or whale entanglements. The last reported incident of a submarine communication cable being damaged by a marine organism was from the mid-1980s.  
  
However, the environment does affect submarine cables in other ways. Fishing, trawling, and shipping activity all play a much more significant role in causing cable faults today.  
  
Repair of damaged cables means sending a repair ship to the location of the problem, splicing the cable, repairing it, and re-attaching the ends. Damaged cables can result in a loss of capacity, increased latency, or in the worst case, a halt of all communication activity.","The article extensively discusses submarine cables, including their construction, operation, and the implications of cable damage.

It specifically mentions the causes of cable faults, primarily due to fishing and shipping activities, and explains how damaged cables can lead to loss of capacity and communication disruptions.

While it does not use the exact term 'cut sea cables,' it addresses the topic in a relevant and detailed manner, satisfying the criterion."

Gallagher & Co.","### Hidden Dangers: Undersea Cables and Mitigating Economic Risk

Subsea infrastructure's vital contribution to global business, and the emerging threats posed by damage and sabotage.

#### Key insights

* Ninety-nine percent of the world's intercontinental internet traffic depends on undersea fiber-optic cables.
* Undersea cables and gas pipelines are vital enablers of business activities and energy security.
* The ""blue economy"" — economic activities set in oceans and their shores — faces emerging threats due to a more challenging geopolitical landscape and the threat of sabotage.
* The consequences of damage to undersea assets can incur costs of billions of dollars, with the greatest risk occurring in areas that rely on a single subsea cable.
* New regulation is coming into place to address and respond to threats impacting vital infrastructure.

Undersea cables are hidden but increasingly vital enablers of the global economy that most people take for granted. Everyday business activities, such as sending emails, making video calls, transmitting data and transferring money, rely on the services provided by telecommunication cables that traverse the floors of the world's seas and oceans.

Along with gas pipelines and electricity connectors, subsea cables are a critical component of global infrastructure, powering global business and maintaining energy security.

Extensive development of new facilities is reinforcing the criticality of blue economy infrastructure, supporting the expansion of the digital economy and explosion of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). Among other things, subsea telecommunication cables are responsible for transmitting 99% of intercontinental internet traffic.

As business and society become ever more reliant on critical subsea infrastructure, it creates a growing source of vulnerability. Recent sabotage attempts on cables in the Red Sea and the Nord Stream gas pipeline explosion in Europe in 2022 are examples of an emerging geopolitical threat.

While it has yet to be formally announced, NATO is understood to be backing an initiative that will make it possible to reroute internet traffic from submarine cables to space in the event of an attack.

The Blue Economy continues to grow rapidly, fueled by the exponential growth of data in the digital age. Meanwhile, the transition to net zero and the ongoing drive to achieve energy security are driving the development of submarine energy cables.

A vast network of underwater infrastructure with thousands of miles of submarine cables, pipelines and other critical infrastructure is vital for the flow of data, energy and resources across country borders and between continents.

As well as channeling data, submarine cables enable the transmission of electricity generated from offshore wind farms, tidal energy facilities and other marine renewables, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and supporting the transition to net zero.

With an ever-increasing need for data storage and access and increasing pressures to move forward on the journey to net zero, the reliance on this critical yet vulnerable underwater infrastructure will continue to grow.

#### Underwater infrastructure, the foundation of the Blue Economy, consists of:

#### Undersea infrastructure powers innovation and growth

As the services the global digital economy provides continue to expand and interconnect, the infrastructure required to support this growth will also expand, contributing to economic development at multiple levels.

**Economic Impact of Subsea Cables' International Connectivity**

Many projects are already underway to further increase the existing network of global submarine cables. The explosion of AI is one factor behind such investment: Large language models require substantial data capabilities to stay operational, and subsea cables offer high bandwidths (upwards of 300-400 terabytes per second), with low lag time.

Meanwhile, global tech giants are in a race to set up data centers across the globe to support the growth in cloud services and cater to the growing demand for edge computing, Internet of Things and GenAI.

While the concept of underwater data centers is still in its infancy, it's likely to gain traction as one way of meeting future needs while reducing carbon and water footprints and boosting security.

All this demand means that businesses' profitability and capacity to innovate are going to become increasingly dependent on the effective operating of subsea infrastructure.

From an energy perspective, countries are transitioning away from fossil fuels, such as coal and gas, to renewable sources such as offshore wind and solar. The shift in energy mix brings more immediate challenges to the fore, including energy security and more volatile grid loads. This increases the importance of gas pipelines, subsea cables and interconnectors and their role in moving surplus gas and electricity from where it's produced to where it's needed.

The Greece-Egypt electrical interconnection (GREGY) is a 1,373-kilometer subsea electricity cable due to come online in 2029-2030 that will carry 3,000 megawatts of electricity, with the potential to power up to 450,000 households, from northern Egypt to Attica in Greece.

#### Subsea cables and interconnectors: The statistics

* The global submarine cable network stretches over 1.3 million kilometers and supports over USD10 trillion in economic activity annually.
* Across 66 developed countries, a 10% rise in broadband penetration could lift gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates by 1.2 percentage points.
* The market for submarine power cables is expected to grow to USD32.9 billion by 2032, driven by the need for efficient power transmission from renewable sources like offshore wind farms.
* The SEA-ME-WE 3 cable is currently the longest submarine fiber-optic cable in operation, spanning 24,233 miles, connecting Europe, the Middle East and India.

### Threats to undersea infrastructure

The importance of undersea cables and other infrastructure in the operation of the global economy means that any disruption to this infrastructure could have serious ramifications in terms of business functionality and profits.

""The rapid expansion of global connectivity is driving the need for an ever-increasing network of subsea cables,"" noted Adam Carrier, head of Consulting at AnotherDay, a Gallagher company. ""As our world becomes more interconnected and the demand for data continues to surge, a significant number of undersea cables are currently under development. In the places where the subsea cables are fewer in number, any damage to those cables can cause a massive setback to the country's economy.""

There are three key potential threat sources to consider: accidental damage, natural hazards and sabotage/cyber-attack.

#### Accidental damage

Reports suggest that more than 70% of cable faults stem from unintentional damage. Subsea cables can be inadvertently damaged in a number of ways: By fishing trawlers or ships dropping anchor, for example, or as a consequence of coastal development, port construction and dredging activities.

Damaged cables rely on specialized equipment and services to get them up and running again, but the global availability of such services is limited, which can cause delays and additional cost.

#### Natural hazards

Underwater infrastructure can also be exposed to natural disasters such as tsunamis and storms, even when laid beneath the seabed.

Submarine cable routes often cross tectonic plate boundaries. Earthquakes can trigger submarine landslides near the junction of tectonic plates, creating turbidity currents that flow over long distances, potentially breaking multiple cables in sequence.

#### Sabotage and cyber-attack

Despite being difficult to access, underwater cables and pipelines are relatively easy to locate, as companies make their whereabouts public to aid navigation and minimize accidents. This public information makes them vulnerable to sabotage.

Attacks on underwater cables are an increasing concern amid ongoing geopolitical tensions, with real potential to cause major damage and disruption. Meanwhile, the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in 2021 is a reminder of the growing cyber risk exposures faced by all critical infrastructure.

### The financial impact of damage to cable networks

Where an item of subsea infrastructure is not backed up by alternative routings, damage to an internet or energy pipeline can cause substantial disruption, resulting in internet outages or even energy blackouts.

Consequently, areas of the world that rely on a single subsea cable or a handful of interconnectors are most vulnerable to disruption.

When fiber-optic cables are damaged:

* Businesses may suffer financial losses due to disrupted operations, missed opportunities, and decreased productivity.
* Extended outages can harm a company's reputation and erode customer trust.
* Companies relying on global supply chains may face delays in shipments and communication with suppliers.
* Low internet connectivity can lead to downtime for online services, affecting customer experience and revenue.

In January 2022, an 827-kilometer fiber-optic cable connecting the South Pacific nation of Tonga to the rest of the world was damaged during the eruption of a volcano. It took a month to fully repair the cable, significantly impacting internet connectivity for the island nation.","The article titled 'Hidden Dangers: Undersea Cables and Mitigating Economic Risk' extensively discusses undersea cables, specifically highlighting their critical role in global internet connectivity, as 99% of intercontinental internet traffic relies on these cables.

It addresses various threats to these cables, including accidental damage and sabotage, indicating a focus on the implications of cut sea cables.

The article provides concrete examples of damage, such as the incident involving a fiber-optic cable connecting Tonga, which emphasizes the economic impact of such disruptions on businesses and internet connectivity.

Overall, the article treats the topic of cut sea cables as a central theme rather than a minor mention, making it relevant to the criterion."

When they break, it could spell disaster for a whole country's internet. How do you fix a fault at the bottom of the ocean?**

It was a little after 17:00 on 18 November 1929 when the ground began to shake. Just off the coast of Burin Peninsula, a finger-like protrusion on the south of Newfoundland, Canada, a 7.2 magnitude earthquake disturbed the evening's peace. Residents noticed only a little damage at first – a few toppled chimney pots.

But out at sea, an unseen force was moving. By around 19:30, a 13m-high (43ft) tsunami made landfall on the Burin Peninsula. In total, 28 people lost their lives as a result of drowning or injuries caused by the wave.

The earthquake was devastating for the local communities, but it also had a long-lasting effect further out at sea. It had triggered a submarine landslide. People did not realise this at the time, historical records suggest, because no one knew such underwater landslides existed. When sediment is disturbed by earthquakes and other geological activity it makes the water denser, causing it to flow downwards like an avalanche of snow down a mountain. The submarine landslide – called a turbidity current – flowed more than 1,000km (621 miles) away from the earthquake's epicentre on the Laurentian Continental Slope at speeds between 50 and 70 knots (57-80mph).

Although the landslide was not noticed at the time, it left a tell-tale clue. In its way lay the latest in communication technology at the time: transatlantic subsea cables. And those cables broke. Twelve of them were snapped in a total of 28 places. Some of the 28 breaks happened almost synchronously with the earthquake. But the other 16 breaks happened over a much longer period, as the cables snapped one after the other in a kind of mysterious ripple pattern, from 59 minutes after the earthquake to 13 hours and 17 minutes later, and over 500km (311 miles) away from the epicentre.

If they'd all been snapped by the quake itself, the cables would have all broken at the same time – so scientists began to wonder, why didn't they? Why did they break one after the other?

It wasn't until 1952 that researchers pieced together why the cables broke in sequence, over such a large area, and at intervals that seemed to slow with distance from the epicentre. They figured out that a landslide smashed through them – the snapping cables traced its movement across the seafloor. Until that point, no one knew of the existence of turbidity currents. Because these cables broke, and because there was a record of the time they broke, they helped in the understanding of ocean movements above and below the surface. They caused a complex repair job, but also became accidental scientific instruments, recording a fascinating natural phenomenon far out of human sight.

Over the following decades, as the global web of deep-sea cables expanded, their repair and maintenance resulted in other surprising scientific discoveries – opening up entirely new worlds and allowing us to spy on the seabed like never before, while also allowing us to communicate at record speed. At the same time, our daily lives, incomes, health and safety have also become more and more dependent on the internet – and ultimately, this complex network of undersea cables. So what happens when they break?

Submarine cables form a global web at the bottom of the sea, keeping us all connected.

There are 1.4 million km (870,000 miles) of telecommunication cables on the seafloor, covering every ocean on the planet. Laid end to end, these cables would span the diameter of the Sun, and are responsible for the transfer of 99% of all digital data. But for something so important, they are surprisingly slender – often little more than 2cm in diameter, or about the width of a hosepipe.

A repeat of the 1929 mass cable outage would have significant impacts on communication between North America and Europe. However, ""for the most part, the global network is remarkably resilient,"" says Mike Clare, the International Cable Protection Committee's marine environmental advisor who researches the impacts of extreme events on submarine systems. ""There are 150 to 200 instances of damage to the global network each year. So if we look at that against 1.4 million km, that's not very many, and for the most part, when this damage happens, it can be repaired relatively quickly.""

Since the first cables were laid in the 19th Century, they have been exposed to extreme environmental events, from submarine volcanic eruption to typhoons and floods. But the biggest cause of damage is not natural.

Most faults, with figures varying 70-80% depending on where you are in the world, relate to accidental human activities like the dropping of anchors or dragging of trawler boat nets, which snag on the cables. These usually occur in depths of 200-300m (but commercial fishing is increasingly pushing into deeper waters – in some places, 1,500m in the Northeast Atlantic). Only 10-20% of faults worldwide relate to natural hazards, and more frequently relate to cables wearing thin in places where currents cause them to rub against rocks, causing what are called ""shunt faults.""

Cables have to be kept thin and light in deeper waters, though, to aid with recovery and repair. Hauling a large, heavy cable up from thousands of metres below sea level would put a huge amount of strain on it. It's the cables nearer the shoreline that tend to be better armoured because they are more likely to be snagged by nets and anchors.

If a fault is found, a repair ship is dispatched. ""All these vessels are strategically placed around the world to be 10-12 days from base to port,"" says Mick McGovern, deputy vice-president for marine operations at Alcatel Submarine Networks. ""You have that time to work out where the fault is, load the cables [and the] repeater bodies – which increase the strength of a signal as it travels along the cables.""

While it took nine months to repair the last of the subsea cable damage caused by the 1929 Newfoundland earthquake, McGovern says a modern deep-water repair should take a week or two depending on the location and the weather. ""When you think about the water depth and where it is, that's not a bad solution.""

That does not mean an entire country's internet is then down for a week. Many nations have more cables and more bandwidth within those cables than the minimum required amount, so that if some are damaged, the others can pick up the slack. This is called redundancy in the system. Because of this redundancy, most of us would never notice if one subsea cable was damaged – perhaps this article would take a second or two longer to load than normal. In extreme events, it can be the only thing keeping a country online.

To repair the damage, the ship deploys a grapnel, or grappling hook, to lift and snip the cable, pulling one loose end up to the surface and reeling it in across the bow with large, motorised drums. The damaged section is then winched into an internal room and analysed for a fault, repaired, tested by sending a signal back to land from the boat, sealed and then attached to a buoy while the process is repeated on the other end of the cable.

Once both ends are fixed, each optical fibre is spliced together under microscope to make sure that there is good connection, and then they are sealed together with a universal joint that is compatible with any manufacturer's cable, making life easier for international repair teams.

The repaired cables are lowered back into the water, and in some cases, the entire process is repeated to ensure the integrity of the repairs.","The article titled ""The deep-sea 'emergency service' that keeps the internet running"" discusses the importance of undersea cables in global communications.

It mentions that ""Ninety-nine percent of the world's digital communications rely on subsea cables"" and provides a historical account of the 1929 earthquake that caused significant cable damage, noting that it ""snapped twelve cables in a total of 28 places."" Furthermore, the article states that there are ""150 to 200 instances of damage to the global network each year,"" primarily due to human activities.

It emphasizes the implications of these damages on internet connectivity and outlines the repair processes for these cables.

These elements indicate that the article is centrally focused on the topic of cut sea cables and their impact on telecommunications.

The tanker is believed to have damaged submarine telecoms and electricity cables by dragging its anchor across the lines late last year.

Late last month, a series of subsea cables between Finland and Estonia were severed, causing significant disruption to data transport between both countries. An adjacent subsea power cable was also damaged.

An investigation into the damage was quickly launched, with Finnish authorities seizing the tanker Eagle S, which was in the vicinity when the damage occurred.

Speaking the following day, Helsinki’s Police Chief Jari Liukku said Finnish authorities were “investigating grave sabotage”, with further allegations that Eagle S is part of a so-called ‘shadow fleet’ of older tankers seeking to evade sanctions on the sale of Russian oil.

On Friday, the ship’s owner, United Arab Emirates-based Caravella LLC FZ, had its request to release the ship denied by a Finnish court.

Repairs to the cable system are expected to take two months.

The Baltic has turned into a hotspot for subsea cable damage since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Late last year, a pair of submarine cables in the region were damaged in what is being investigated as an act of sabotage as part of Russia’s ‘hybrid warfare’ strategy to destabilize the region.

In response, NATO has said it will boost its presence in the region to protect the critical infrastructure.

The Baltic is not the only region seeing a worrisome increase in submarine cable damage in recent years. The Red Sea, for example, saw significant cable damage last year linked to Houthi rebels in Yemen attacking shipping routes.

The geopolitically charged waters around Taiwan have also seen increased cable disruption. Today, a submarine cable in the region was cut off the north-east coast of the island, with authorities blaming a Cameroonian-registered cargo ship, the Shunxin-39, for causing accidental damage.

It became inoperable due to a “shunt fault” approximately 1,886 kilometers from Alexandria towards Palermo, Italy in the S4 section of the cable.

A shunt fault occurs when the submarine cable insulation becomes damaged, causing a short circuit when it comes into contact with water. While repairs are underway, it is likely that the outage will take a further 4 days at a minimum and might take up to 10 days depending on weather and sea conditions.

Until today, SEA-ME-WE-4 was operating with limited capacity; however, starting 12 PM Pakistan Time today, all westbound traffic from Egypt onwards has been shut down.

This means that all traffic to Europe and the US (from Pakistan) may face higher latency, but not a complete blackout due to redundant/alternate pipes available for usage, though they cost extra to service providers because of the shift of all traffic load to secondary pipes.

In a telephonic communication, a Transworld official told ProPakistani that Transworld has bought additional capacity, worth millions of dollars, for eastbound routes, initially landing at Singapore via Japan to the United States and then to Europe.

This will increase the route distance hence the latency, but traffic will not be impacted at large, said the official.

By Chen Yu-fu / Staff reporter  

Sea vessels from neighboring countries have repeatedly damaged submarine cables connecting Taiwan proper with outlying islands, a budget review report published by the National Audit Office showed.  

Communication between Taiwan proper and outlying islands depends mainly on underwater cable communication systems, supplemented by microwave transmission and satellite systems, the report says.  

Once underwater cable system malfunctions, it can severely affect communication among Taiwan proper, Penghu, Kinmen and Lienchiang (Matsu) counties, it says.  

The nation has 10 domestic submarine cables, all invested, constructed and maintained by Chunghwa Telecom, the report says.  

There were 36 cases of damage caused by external forces from 2019 to last year, with an average of about seven submarine cable failures per year, it says.  

Twelve submarine cable failures were recorded last year alone, the most in the past five years, the report says.  

“It is reported the damage was mainly caused by the operation or anchoring of various vessels, such as sand dredgers, fishing boats and merchant ships from neighboring countries. Repairs can sometimes take more than four months to complete, which greatly affects the lives of people on the outlying islands,” it says.  

Among the damaged cables is the No. 2 undersea telecom cable connecting New Taipei City’s Tamsui District (淡水) and Lienchiang County’s Dongyin Island (東引), which was suspected of being damaged by a fishing boat anchoring on Feb. 2 last year, it says.  

Another cable, connecting Caota (草漯) in Taoyuan and Lienchiang County’s Nangan Island (南竿), the No. 3 cable, was suspected of being damaged by a cargo ship on Feb. 8, resulting in the congestion of mobile communications and Internet services for more than 10,000 households in Matsu, it says.  

The incident seriously affected the operations of government agencies, financial transactions, medical services and transportation, it says.  

“The National Communications Commission says it has asked telecoms to reduce the risk of submarine cable damage through multiple protection mechanisms, including conducting telecom traffic diversion drills and replacing submarine cables in sections with higher failure rates.

Businesses have been suffering extremely slow connections which has severely affected their operations, especially those involved in outsourcing and teleworking.

Ultra-high speed undersea cables form the Internet backbone which transfers data between countries and continents. Often almost all Internet communications for an entire country are routed through just a handful of cables, meaning damage to one causes significant problems.

*Published Date: 03/05/2024*  
  
We doubt the Houthis are behind this incident; they seem to have no observable intent to target the cables and little to gain from the disruption.  
  
Further damage to subsea cables in the Red Sea has the potential to cause major disruption to network connectivity.  
  
We doubt the Houthis were behind recently-reported damage to underwater cables in the Red Sea. A telecoms provider reported damage to a few sea cables that it manages off the coast of Yemen on 24 February. And international and regional media outlets have subsequently said that the Houthis are the possible perpetrator. The group has denied it, which is unusual. It usually claims its attacks directly. We also understand that dredging or anchor drifting are other plausible causes. While the recent incidents did not appear to result in widespread network disruption, damage to cables in the Red Sea region have previously done so.
  
### Implications for internet connectivity  
Damage to subsea cables in the Red Sea has the potential to result in major disruption to network connectivity. That is particularly in parts of East Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The EU has previously described the Red Sea as one of the ‘bottlenecks’ for the bloc’s connectivity with Asia; 16 intercontinental cables reportedly run through it. Cybersecurity firms noted that the cutting of two cables in the region (one where it passes overland in Egypt) in 2022 affected internet connectivity for millions of users for several hours in Africa and the Middle East, particularly in Ethiopia.
  
The recent incidents did not appear to result in wide-ranging disruption to internet services. Cloudflare Radar, which monitors internet traffic trends, said on 27 February that it did ‘[not] observe any clear changes in internet traffic or latency in potentially affected areas…including Djibouti, Egypt, Kenya and Tanzania’. A cable operator reportedly confirmed outages to its services from Kenya to Egypt starting on 24 February, but said internet traffic was rerouted through alternative paths. The internet connectivity tracker NetBlocks did report on network disruptions in Djibouti between 24-26 February, though.
  
### Analysis of potential causes  
It is unclear what was the origin of the damage. The company that manages the cables said that it has begun an investigation. It would appear within the general means of the Houthis to damage the cables. The US on 18 February stated that they have struck an unmanned underwater vessel in Houthi-controlled areas. And waters in the Red Sea, especially around Bab Al-Mandeb, appear to be shallow enough (50-150m) to allow professional divers to cut the cables. But based on a recent EU report on sea cables security, anchor drifting or dredging can also potentially harm the cables.
  
We are not convinced by a recent flurry of news over the past few days speculating that this was a Houthi attack. Those reports have come from Israeli-based media outlets as well as the international press. This follows regional media outlets reporting in December 2023 and February this year that the group ‘may sabotage Western internet cables’. But these reports cite online accounts that are only allegedly linked to the Houthis, based on our monitoring of those channels.
  
### Houthis do not seem intent on attacking cables  
The Houthi do not seem to want to target sea cables. The rebel group has publicly denied these and previous allegations; the Sanaa-based ministry of telecommunications on 27 February said it would ‘keep all submarine cables and its relevant services away from any possible risks’. There seems to be little the group has to gain from hiding responsibility it might have. On the contrary; the Houthis have openly claimed recent attacks on commercial shipping. The group launched at least 62 attacks against a wide range of commercial vessels since October, including Norwegian, Hong Kong and Panama owned.","The article titled 'Red Sea | Assessment of subsea cable damage' discusses the damage to subsea cables in the Red Sea, particularly mentioning a telecom provider's report of damage to cables off the coast of Yemen.

An Attack on a Spam Tracking Company and Cut Internet Cord Slows Down Speeds**  
March 29, 2013 — ""The Internet almost broke."" ""The Internet slowed down."" ""Internet cable cut.""

Those are just a few of the statements bandied about by organizations and in the media after two separate, unrelated events this week: First, there was one of the worst cyberattacks ever on the Internet; second, an underseas cable off the coast of Egypt was cut. The two attacks have affected Internet speeds and stability.

So what happened exactly? And is the Internet _really_ slower?

**Spamhaus and Cyberbunker Denial of Service Attacks**  
It's been called the biggest denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in history and one of the fiercest cyberfights. So who was fighting and how did it happen?

At the center of it all are two companies – Spamhaus and Cyberbunker.

The Geneva-based Cyberbunker, which is based out of a former NATO bunker, is a hosting service, or a company that hosts websites and services on its servers. But it's not just a normal hosting company – this one will host any type of website. The only things it refuses to host or save is child pornography and terrorist sites. Sites with malware or other dangerous viruses, which can attack your computers, are free game. Cyberbunker also allows the sites that use the service to stay completely anonymous.

But when Spamhaus, a company that works to block spam, added the company to its list of suspected spam-hosting websites, Cyberbunker was far from happy. So it launched a massive denial of service attack (DDoS) at Spamhaus. A DDoS attack is a cyberattack that aims to make a service unusable.

""Imagine someone knocking on the door and you have to say, Hello, who is it?"" Tom Galvin, executive director of Digital Citizens Alliance, explained to ABC News. ""Now imagine that is happening every single second,"" he added, referring to the traffic Spamhaus had to respond to. ""What else are you getting done? It requires the network to verify who else is on the other side of the door and it locks the system up."" Continuing the traffic analogy, it was as if lots of cars were trying to get through on a road that is blocked off.

**Internet Slow Down?**  
In the case of Spamhaus, the attack was so large and so much data was being fired at the company that the congestion caused Internet speed disruptions. CloudFare, the company that helped Spamhaus fight the attack, said that at one point 300Gbps of attack traffic was being sent, which would make this one of the largest attacks ever reported.

""You can only force so much data and packets of information through a connection,"" Adam Wosotowsky, messaging data architect at McAfee Labs, explained to ABC News. ""When that packet is going across, it has to get to the other side cleanly, if you have contention issues and a lot of extraneous data, those packets start to collide and the network isn't as clean. It gets clogged.""

As a result of the unprecedented attack, there were service slowdowns for ordinary Internet users, and McAfee and other security companies have confirmed that some sites were affected with slow load times. CloudFare said it caused disruptions to London and Hong Kong's backend Internet systems. Netflix was said to be one of the services that was impacted by the slow load times, though Netflix has declined to comment and it hasn't been confirmed. Typically DDoS attacks, which occur all the time, don't have such far-reaching impact.

Madory didn't minimize the repercussions of the Cyberbunker-Spamhaus spat, but he did say that another event this week could have had even bigger or more widespread implications.

""One of the biggest cables that connects Europe to the biggest cables was cut, that's a way to create a widespread impact,"" Madory said. [According to the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21963100), three scuba divers were caught trying to cut an undersea Internet cable off Egypt. The damaged cable caused service disruptions in Egypt, Africa and other parts of the Middle East. The motive of the men is unknown. Problems in Internet service in Egypt is not new: Two years ago, during the [Arab Spring uprising](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/embassy-attacks-put-critical-focus-obamas-arab-spring/story?id=17232430), Internet access in Egypt was cut off.

Other outages in the region were thought to be attributed to additional underseas cable disruption, likely caused by a boat or an anchor. Madory and Wosotowsky both said that there are other cable links to provide connectivity to the countries, but that it can have a significant effect on speeds and stability of the service.

""It's one thing with a DDoS attack, we are able to push that away with code, but when you cut a wire you have to get out there and splice that thing back together and get it up and running,"" Wosotowsky said. ""Hardware attacks are much more expensive and take a lot more time to recover from.""

**The Digital Mafia**  
The two attacks, while not related, do demonstrate that it's not just the individuals on the Internet, but the Internet itself, which stands in harm's way with the rise of cyberattacks.

""Bad guys are always going to be on the look for the weakness in the chain, that's why these things take place. It will either be a DDoS or cables being cut,"" Galvin said. ""It's the same way 50 or 40 years ago we made an effort to crackdown on the Mafia. We need to have the same focus on the criminals on the Internet today.","The article titled ""Is the Internet O.K.?

The 10 000km Eassy cable, which stretches from Sudan to SA, suffered a cut on 17 February between Djibouti and Port Sudan, says Chris Wood, CEO of West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC), which has an almost 30% stake in the network.

Wood says the rest of the cable is still functioning because its “collapsed loop network configuration” allows for the internal re-routing of traffic when a break occurs. The WIOCC chief executive also says the fault on Eassy did not have “much impact” on its customers either, as the vast majority of its data traffic exits Africa through Djibouti.

However, it was not only the Eassy cable that was sliced. The SMW3 and EIG networks, used by Eassy to carry traffic from Africa to Europe, were damaged just north of Djibouti in what appears to have been part of a single incident.

“It is believed that a cargo ship dragged its anchor over a distance of some 150km in the Red Sea, cutting all three cables one after the other,” notes Wood.

“Most Eassy owners also own capacity on other systems and have in-built redundancy in their networks. As such, most of the Africa to Europe traffic affected by the cuts to SMW3 and EIG has already been re-routed onto other systems, both in Djibouti and via South Africa,” Wood adds.

WIOCC says the SMW3 cable could be repaired by 12 March, a fix that could restore most of the affected traffic on its direct path to Europe. The company also says the EIG cable could be repaired by the same date as the Eassy cable, 20 March.

### Piracy threat?

The damage to all three cables, though, occurred in and around the area of the Red Sea, which has experienced problems of piracy - a factor that could potentially delay repair times, according to experts.

“It's a very dangerous spot to ever park a ship,” says JP Viljoen, a systems engineer at Neology, a wholesale bandwidth provider to ISPs in Africa.

The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Commercial Crime Services said on 15 February it received information that in the Bab El Mandeb Straits of the Red Sea “seven pirates in two skiffs... chased a chemical tanker”. The ICC Commercial Crime Services also said that in the same area of the Red Sea, on 27 February, the crew of a bulk carrier in the strait reported sightings of nine skiffs approaching their boat aggressively.

On both occasions, the alleged pirates aborted their attacks, according to the reports.

But Mike Last, director for marketing and international business development at WIOCC, says: “I don't think piracy is an issue with this.”

He notes that the time-scale of the planned repair is dependent on issues such as securing permits, sailing time and weather conditions. He says a ship from the Middle East is going to be sent to fix the cable. He did not specify when that ship would be sent exactly.

### Destructive anchors

Meanwhile, reports have emerged in the last few days that The East African Marine System (TEAMS) 5 000km undersea fibre-optic cable, stretching from Kenya to the United Arab Emirates, was also cut by a ship's anchor in the Kenyan port of Mombasa.

The disruption caused a 20% slowdown in Internet speeds in Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, Ethiopia and South Sudan, the BBC reported.

Wood says the Eassy cable is functioning normally from Mombasa.

He adds that some TEAMS owners are in the process of re-routing their traffic onto the Eassy system in Mombasa, to reduce the impact in Kenya and other countries in East Africa while the repair to TEAMS is undertaken.","The article titled 'Ship slices three undersea cables' directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables, mentioning specific incidents involving the Eassy, SMW3, and EIG cables.

**Author:** Duncan McLeod  
**Published Date:** 03/28/2013  

It is extremely unlikely, although not impossible, that saboteurs were responsible for the cut in Seacom and other undersea cables north of Egypt last Friday, Seacom CEO Mark Simpson says.

Simpson’s comments come after news on Thursday morning that Egyptian authorities had arrested three divers off the coast of Alexandria suspected of trying to sever the Sea-Me-We 4 cable system that runs through the region.

According to reports by international news wires, Egyptian naval forces, which made the arrests, have not furnished the alleged saboteurs’ motives for wanting to cut Sea-Me-We 4. The cable is a crucial link between Europe, the Middle East and Asia.

Simpson tells TechCentral that the divers were arrested just hundreds of metres from the Egyptian shoreline, where the cable was fairly easily accessible.

Last week’s break to the Seacom cable, on the other hand, occurred nearly 20km from the shore in much deeper water. Simpson says the cable break also had all of the characteristics of having been cut by a ship’s anchor being dragged along the sea bed, making it more unlikely the cut was due to sabotage.

“You can never say never, but I’d be very surprised [if it was sabotage],” Simpson says.

The Seacom CEO said earlier this week that ""external aggression"" caused by ships dragging their anchors ""remains a common cause of damage to cable systems globally, despite our continued efforts to protect the cable with armour, burying, notifications to ships of cable locations, and exclusion zones.""

Cairo - Egypt's coastguard caught three divers cutting through an undersea Internet cable on Wednesday, the army said, the first suggestion criminals might be involved in days of severed connections and disruptions online.  

A patrol stopped a fishing boat near the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria and arrested three divers, the army spokesperson said on his official Facebook page.  

He did not give details of the divers' possible motive in severing the link he said belonged to Egypt Telecom, the country's monopoly landline provider.  

“The armed forces foiled an attempt and arrested three divers while they were cutting a submarine cable,” he said.  

It was not immediately clear whether the incident was related to disruptions off Egypt reported by cable operator SEACOM last week that it said hit several lines connecting Europe with Africa, the Middle East and Asia.  

SEACOM did not give any explanation for the cuts it said hit its cables and other network systems funnelling telecoms traffic backwards and forwards in the early hours of Friday.

(TNS) WASHINGTON — Hundreds of thousands of miles of fiber-optic cable lay on the ocean floors, a crucial part of the global internet’s backbone, and only rarely do ship anchors, undersea landslides or saboteurs disrupt them.  
Still, a few voices now call for stronger global mechanisms and even military action to protect the cables against future malicious activity by states, saboteurs or extremists.  
“The infrastructure that underpins the internet — these undersea cables — are clearly vulnerable,” said Rishi Sunak, a British member of Parliament and champion of more vigorous action to protect submarine networks. “They underpin pretty much everything that we do.”  
Undersea cables conduct nearly 97 percent of all global communications, and every day an estimated $10 trillion in financial transfers and vast amounts of data pass through the seabed routes. Satellites, once crucial but now limited in speed and bandwidth, handle only a tiny percentage of global communications.  
As reliance on the underwater cables soars, a growing list of countries — and even companies — have the expertise to deploy unmanned vehicles to ocean depths to access them.  
“Nowadays, there are a lot of countries and companies that have the ability to send vehicles down to the sea floor and have them manipulate, install or take away undersea cables,” said Bryan Clark, a retired naval submariner and former Navy strategist who is a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington think tank.  
The optical strands inside the cables have extraordinary capacity to transmit data, millions of phone calls per fiber. The cables that house bundled fiber optics are no thicker than a human wrist.  
Failures along cable routes are rare, numbering on average barely 200 a year along the estimated 650,000 miles of active international commercial cables laid along sea beds.  
“It’s still vanishingly small when the amount of cable around the globe is considered,” said Keith Schofield, general manager of the International Cable Protection Committee, which has its headquarters in Lymington, England.  
There are 428 known commercial fiber-optic cable routes worldwide. Many cables are laid parallel along heavily trafficked routes, like the U.S. to Britain, or through the Mediterranean and Red Sea toward India and the rest of Asia, and come ashore together. Florida has about 10 landing points for the two dozen or so cables that come ashore there.  
Most problems occur close to landfall, not in the open ocean, and the majority involve nets from trawlers or damage by anchors, Schofield said.  
But in recent years, a few incidents have drawn attention to sabotage and espionage.  
In October 2015, U.S. authorities scrambled to monitor Russian submarine patrols and a high-tech Russian surface ship, the Yantar, in a corridor of the North Atlantic that hosts a cluster of undersea cables. The Yantar carried deep-sea submersibles and cable-cutting gear.  
In an earlier incident, Egypt said in March 2013 that it had arrested three scuba divers who had tried to cut an undersea fiber optic cable in the Mediterranean off Alexandria that was a vital communications link between Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Egypt never explained who the three saboteurs worked for.  
At one time, only the United States and the Soviet Union, now Russia, deployed submarines able to reach deep depths to manipulate fiber-optic cables. But deep-sea remotely powered vehicles are now widely available, putting the technology in more hands.  
“All you need to do is give them a claw and sharp jaws and tell them to go down and clip the cable,” said Jim Hayes, president of the Fiber Optic Association, a nonprofit professional society based in Santa Monica, California.  
Hayes said far simpler means can be found for those intent on damaging the cables, especially near the congested points where they make landfall.  
“If you drag an anchor and start pulling with enough force, you can bend and kink the cable … and snap the fiber,” Hayes said.  
Since the first submarine telegraphic cable was laid across the Atlantic in 1858, undersea cables have mostly been in private hands, left alone by governments and global bodies.  
“Because cables aren’t owned by governments, governments have ignored them,” Schofield said.  
Perhaps not entirely. The U.S. government in the 1970s is known to have tapped a cable off the Kuril Islands in eastern Russia. And in 2013, National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed that U.S. and British spy agencies were stealing data from undersea cables.  
A handful of other nations are believed to have the same capabilities.  
Sunak, the British parliamentarian, laid out a number of steps to protect the undersea cables in a 46-page study published Dec. 1 by Britain’s Policy Exchange think tank.  
He called for enhanced global legal protections, establishing of cable protection zones above corridors used by multiple undersea cables and more robust protections at landfall sites.  
“They are not secured to the level, for example, of a nuclear power station or a military base is secured at,” Sunak said in a telephone interview. “You can find them, sometimes they are just a wire fence and maybe a night-time security guy from the local town. It’s not exactly crack security against a terrorist operation.”  
Sunak’s study — Undersea cables: Indispensable, insecure — calls for undersea sensors for cables, creation of backup or “dark” cables that would not be publicly identified, and recognition that an attack on cables would pose “an existential threat” to the world economy.  
“We have allowed this vital infrastructure to grow increasingly vulnerable and this should worry us all,” former Navy Adm. James Stavridis, former U.S. Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, wrote in a preface to the study.  
Others involved in senior U.S. cybersecurity positions concur.  
“What it means is that concerned nations need to have robust capabilities to monitor those cables and to repair them or to separate any illegal intrusions,” Rand Beers, a former undersecretary of Homeland Security in the Obama administration, said in an interview.

Sir Stuart Peach: Russia poses a ""new risk"" to economy and ways of living.

The UK's top military officer has warned that Russia could strike a ""catastrophic"" blow to the economy by targeting communications and internet cables that run under the sea. Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, the chief of the defence staff, said the lines could potentially be cut or disrupted.

The suggestion raises several questions:
- Is that something Russia's likely to do?
- What would happen if they - or someone else - did such a thing?

**What do the cables do?**
They provide internet and communications links between separate countries and continents. The full network of around 428 cables spans 683,508 miles (1.1 million km), circling the globe. Huge quantities of data fly around under the waves, in cables filled with fibre optics - strands of glass as thin as a sheet of paper. Unfortunately, while their technology is reliable, these pivotal cables are physically fragile.

**Why are defence chiefs worried?**
The BBC's defence correspondent, Jonathan Beale, says fears of Russia cutting, disrupting or ""wire-tapping"" undersea communication lines are growing. Defence and intelligence chiefs cite the country's modernised navy, increased submarine activity and willingness to use information warfare. Russian subs are increasingly present in the North Atlantic, particularly the GIUK Gap, a strip of ocean between Greenland, Iceland, and the UK.

**What would happen if the cables were cut?**
Keir Giles, an expert in Russian information warfare, stresses that this is not a new concern. He thinks it's unlikely to happen as the economic fallout would also affect Russia but it is definitely a scenario for which they are practising. The damage would be considerable. The economic impact would be enormous and immediate.

**What's in it for Russia?**
Information control, in short. They are probing the vulnerabilities of civilian communications infrastructure. Russia has been looking everywhere for physical access to the communications infrastructure and telecommunications expertise embedded with their special forces.

Service providers quickly tried to redirect customers to the cables that had not been affected but the reduced capacity was no match for the normal workload of users, leaving an Internet service that was painfully slow or non-existent.  

by Marc Carnegie  
Hong Kong (AFP) Dec 28, 2006  
Internet and phone services were disrupted across much of Asia on Wednesday after an earthquake damaged undersea cables, leaving one of the world's most tech-savvy regions in a virtual blackout. From frustrated traders seeking in vain for stock quotes to anxious newshounds accustomed to round-the-clock updates on world events, millions of people from China to Japan to Australia were affected.  

The disruption was widespread, hitting China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong and elsewhere, with knock-on effects as far away as Australia for companies whose Internet is routed through affected areas.  

There was no chaos on the stock exchanges or any of the other doomsday scenarios, but reports that services could be down for weeks were dramatic enough.  

South Korea's information and communication ministry said all six undersea fibreoptic cables off Taiwan were hit, causing major disruption. All services, except for exclusive business lines, returned to normal shortly afterwards as they were switched to other systems.  

But officials could not put a timeframe on when business lines would be fixed. ""It is not a matter of days,"" said Hong Seoung-Yong, a ministry official handling the problem. ""It will take longer than that to repair the damaged lines.""  

A 7.1-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Taiwan on Tuesday night, which was followed by several smaller quakes in the region, apparently damaged the vast network of underwater cables that enables modern communication.  

""The Internet capacity in Taiwan is about 40 percent now, so the service is jammed,"" said a spokesman for Chunghwa Telecom, Taiwan's largest phone company.  

In China, web users in cities as far apart as Beijing in the north and Chongqing in the southwest reported difficulties accessing overseas websites, state media reported.  

The earthquake cut at least six undersea cables owned by China Telecom, one of the country's largest telecomunications and broadband providers, affecting Internet links with America, Europe and other regions, Xinhua news agency quoted the company as saying. China Mobile, another top Chinese telecom provider, also reported problems.  

Xinhua said repair work was likely to be hampered by aftershocks expected to continue for up to a week.  

Phone services in some countries were also disrupted, in particular for calls to the United States.  

""Several undersea data cables were damaged,"" said a spokesman for PCCW, Hong Kong's biggest telecoms company.  

Service providers quickly tried to redirect customers to the cables that had not been affected but the reduced capacity was no match for the normal workload of users, leaving an Internet service that was painfully slow or non-existent.  

""It's a nightmare, basically, because we have no idea what is going on in the markets today,"" said Steve Rowles, an analyst with CFC Seymour in Hong Kong, who echoed others in saying that damage was limited due to year's end.  

""It has happened on the right day as a lot of people are away for holidays, so there's low trading volumes,"" he said.  

The Tokyo Stock Exchange, the world's largest bourse outside of New York, was functioning without problems, a spokesman said.  

The Hong Kong stock exchange also said it was also working without problems, but after-hours crude trading in Singapore was affected as traders reported they could not access the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex).  

NTT Communications, the long-distance call business of Japan's largest telecom firm Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., said 1,400 toll-free phone lines and 84 international lines used internally by companies were affected.  

The crux of the trouble seemed to be in the underseas routes near Taiwan, which providers would try to bypass in favour of other routes through Europe, said a spokesman for Japanese telecoms firm KDDI Corp, Satoru Ito.  

""If there is too much traffic on that route, it might get blocked up and further slow down Internet connections,"" Ito said.

**Undersea cables have the globe hardwired for communication  
**Sydney (AFP) Dec 27 - The disruption to international telecom and Internet services Wednesday caused by a strong earthquake in Taiwan highlight our increasing dependence on high-tech cable systems across the world.  

The earthquake, measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale, hit southern Taiwan hard late Tuesday and disturbed several of the massive submarine cables running offshore which link countries in Asia with the United States and beyond.  

Analysts said most international telecommunications are now carried by submarine cable, forming a multi-billion dollar network that spans the globe.  

Booming demand for increasingly sophisticated services is met by continually adding capacity but as countless users found out on Wednesday, they have become ever more dependent on a system which can be vulnerable at certain key points.  

Independent telecommications analyst Paul Budde said in a report earlier this year that the first undersea cables were laid about 150 years ago to transmit telegrams and they have evolved to reflect changing technology.  

The Australia-based analyst said it cost up to 500,000 US dollars a kilometre (1,000 yards) to lay modern cables and recently, there had been an increase in development of submarine infrastructure as demand for broadband Internet and cheap telephone services increased.  

""Changes in undersea systems have taken place on a giant scale -- not since the initial building of these networks 150 years ago have we seen such activity, mainly driven by the increase in data traffic.  

""Systems that were built as late as 1998 proved to be inadequate for the demand in capacity required a mere 18 months later.  

""Within a period of a few short years, there were ... at least 1,000 long-distance carriers and 10,000 ISP (Internet service providers) requiring global connectivity,"" he said.  

The disruption Wednesday was widespread, hitting services in China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong, with knock-on effects elsewhere.  

Operators said repairs were underway, with traffic being redirected over other cable systems in the meantime in an effort to ensure some services were available, albeit slower than normal.","The article titled ""Quake Cuts Off Much Of Asia Internet"" discusses the impact of a 7.1-magnitude earthquake that damaged several undersea cables, leading to significant internet and phone service disruptions across Asia.

It directly mentions ""undersea cables"" and details the consequences of their damage, including a reduction in internet capacity and difficulties faced by users in accessing services.

The central theme of the article revolves around this topic, providing both direct references and contextual implications of the cable damage.

Mauritania was taken offline for two days late last month after a submarine internet cable was cut.  
No one knows why or how it was cut, though Sierra Leone's government appears to have interfered with its citizens' internet access around that time.  
Undersea web cables are uniquely vulnerable to sabotage.  
UK and US military officials have previously indicated that Russia is capable of trying something like this, though there is no indication that it was involved in this break.

LONDON — For years, countries have worried that a hostile foreign power might cut the undersea cables that supply the world with internet service.

Late last month, we got a taste of what that might be like. An entire country, Mauritania, was taken offline for two days because an undersea cable was cut.

The 17,000-kilometer African Coast to Europe submarine cable, which connects 22 countries from France to South Africa, was severed on March 30, cutting off web access partially or totally to the residents of Sierra Leone and Mauritania.

It also affected service in Ivory Coast, Senegal, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Gambia, and Benin, according to Dyn, a web-infrastructure company owned by Oracle.

It is not clear how the cable was cut. But the government of Sierra Leone seems to have imposed an internet blackout on the night of March 31 in an attempt to influence an election there.

There had not been a significant outage along the cable in the past five years.

Loss of service to Mauritania was particularly severe, as the Dyn chart below shows.

""The most significant and longest-lasting disruption was seen in Mauritania, with a complete outage lasting for nearly 48 hours, followed by partial restoration of connectivity,"" David Belson wrote in a Dyn research blog on Thursday.

The international cable system has several levels of built-in redundancy that allowed providers such as Africell, Orange, Sierra Leone Cable, and Sierratel to restore service.

But the break shows just how vulnerable the worldwide web is to the simple act of cutting a cable. About 97% of all international data is carried on such cables, according to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.

Here's a map from the telecom analytics company TeleGeography of the cables in Europe:

And those connecting the US:

UK and US military intelligence officials have repeatedly warned that relatively little is done to guard the safety of the cables and that Russia's navy continually conducts activities near them.

In 2013, three divers were arrested in Egypt after attempting to cut submarine web cables.

""In the most severe scenario of an all-out attack upon undersea cable infrastructure by a hostile actor the impact of connectivity loss is potentially catastrophic, but even relatively limited sabotage has the potential to cause significant economic disruption and damage military communications,"" James Stavridis, a retired US Navy admiral, said in a 2017 report for the think tank Policy Exchange.

""Russian submarine forces have undertaken detailed monitoring and targeting activities in the vicinity of North Atlantic deep-sea cable infrastructure,"" he added.

There is no indication that Russia was involved in the ACE breakage. But military strategists are likely to study the Mauritania break as an example of the effect of knocking a country off the web by cutting its cables.","The article titled ""Undersea international internet cables cut in Africa"" discusses the cutting of an undersea cable that affected internet connectivity in Mauritania and several other African countries.

It provides direct mentions of 'undersea cables' and describes a specific incident where the African Coast to Europe submarine cable was severed, taking Mauritania offline for two days.

The article details the implications of this incident, highlighting how the cable cut impacted internet access in multiple countries and discusses the vulnerability of undersea cables to sabotage.

It also references military concerns regarding the safety of such cables and the potential consequences of their disruption.

Alright. Grab your foil hats if you must, but there’s some things that need to be said here.  
While working hard at my job today I was stunned after I read engadget’s report that another large submarine internet cable had been severed. This comes after the news that other cables had been severed reducing the internet, phone, and television capabilities of many countries to nil.  
It seems, that something is not quite right here. Just when I am starting to doubt my gut instinct, the Khaleej Times reports that it is in fact 5 submarine cables that have been damaged:  
> “Quoting TeleGeography and describing the effect the cuts had on the Internet world, Mahesh Jaishanker, executive director, Business Development and Marketing, du, said, “The submarine cable cuts in FLAG Europe-Asia cable 8.3km away from Alexandria, Egypt and SeaMeWe-4 affected at least 60 million users in India, 12 million in Pakistan, six million in Egypt and 4.7 million in Saudi Arabia.””  
According to their reports, there was another cable severed that went unreported. So, here’s the list that they had of the 5 different cables:  
> “These are SeaMeWe-4 (South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe-4) near Penang, Malaysia, the FLAG Europe-Asia near Alexandria, FLAG near the Dubai coast, FALCON near Bandar Abbas in Iran and SeaMeWe-4, also near Alexandria.”  
As I said: 3 was quite a few. 4 is pushing it. 5 starts to make you wonder.  
We’re supposed to believe that these were most likely caused by an anchor from a ship fighting a storm. This author finds it hard to believe that this anchor was drug behind a boat from Egypt to Malaysia.  
So everyone is scrambling to try and figure out why this would happen. Here’s some of the possible reasons that I have found while looking around the internet:  
*   U.S. Government  
*   Israeli Government  
*   Aliens  
*   Underwater Monsters  
*   The Cloverfield Monster  
*   Rudy Giuliani  
However, this author actually dug a bit deeper and found a trail that leads from the owners of most of these internet cables all the way back to some very, very large companies in the U.S. and in the U.K. Which companies you ask? Who is behind this?  
Well, that’s the topic for my next post. You’ll have to subscribe to my RSS feed and stay tuned for my findings.

It has emerged that the incident earlier this year occurred in waters off the northeast coast. The Air Corps had dispatched an aircraft to monitor its movements as it is a list of Russian-related vessels.

There have been several incidents in the Baltic Sea where anchors, dropped by Russian-linked vessels, have damaged critical internet cables.

The Air Corps was able to film the ship, dropping the anchor in the area, and following communication from the Irish crew the cargo vessel fled. It was not confirmed if the ship was intentionally targeting undersea infrastructure or if it was a case of bad seamanship.

The ship, sailing under a flag from the Caribbean region, had been in trouble in the Baltic Sea in the same month. German authorities escorted it out of the area along with Swedish and Danish naval colleagues.

On that occasion, she was sailing from St Petersburg en route through the waters near Gotland, an island off Sweden.

The sighting of it in Irish waters was made earlier this year and it was being monitored after intelligence was shared from a friendly nation with the Irish State.

An Irish Air Corps maritime patrol vessel was dispatched to keep watch – it is understood that they recorded it, using specialist camera equipment, as it dropped the anchor.

It is understood the ship was contacted by radio by the Irish Defence Forces and directed to haul its anchor back up and it departed the area.

The Journal has learned that the ship is back in Irish waters and is heading towards the west coast.

It is understood that the ship has steamed from the Bay of Biscay and is currently off the Cork and Kerry coast.

Using an open source flight monitoring service, The Journal was able to follow an Air Corps CASA 295 aircraft which went to a location near the ship this afternoon.

This publication has previously revealed that Ireland held a major exercise behind closed doors to test how Ireland will deal with a complete loss of the internet after a targeted attack.

It is understood that the event, known as a tabletop exercise, was held in February and involved multiple Government departments and agencies including the Defence Forces, An Garda Síochána and other emergency services.

The scenario was a concerted cyber attack which was combined with the loss of multiple undersea cables.

There are a large amount of fibre optic internet cables connecting Europe to the US and other parts of the world running through Irish waters. They carry all high-speed internet traffic, including banking and other critical data.","The article discusses a Russian-linked ship dropping anchor near an undersea cable, which is a direct reference to the topic of cut sea cables.

It highlights previous incidents where Russian vessels have damaged critical internet cables and mentions the implications of undersea cables on internet connectivity.

Furthermore, the article references a government exercise that involved scenarios of losing multiple undersea cables due to attacks, reinforcing its focus on the topic.

**Author:** Nigel Parnell  
**Published Date:** 05/09/2024  

The Internet is the thread that ties billions of people together for work, study, socializing, shopping, and gaming.  

Much of the traffic generated from these activities is derived from the US and Europe. It makes its way to all other parts of the world through a vast network of data centers, routers, and switches interconnected globally by an array of submarine cables.  

Currently, around 559 submarine cable systems span 1.5 million kilometers, connecting the smallest Pacific islands to the largest economies of Europe, Asia, and North America. As of 2023, 98% of all global Internet traffic was carried by submarine cables, carrying USD 9.47 Trillion in daily financial transactions.  

Unfortunately, most businesses are not prepared for significant Internet disruption from whatever cause.  

**Cable ‘Choke Points’ Impact Internet Resilience**  
By the nature of geography, the cables that span the world have ‘choke points’ where the volume and proximity of cables on the sea bed are greater. These places include:  
- The Suez Canal/Red Sea, a prime route for East-West connectivity  
- Singapore, the key South East Asia hub  
- Malta and Gibraltar, for European and African access.  

According to the United Nations, 150 to 200 subsea cable faults occur annually. Fishing and shipping activities account for nearly two-thirds of the total. Fishing techniques that touch the sea floor, such as trawl nets and dredges, are hazardous for cables.  

**Economic Cost of Cable Cuts**  
Estimating the financial impact of a submarine cable cut is tricky, given that nearly all are privately owned. A recent report suggested that it costs the West Indian Ocean Cable Company USD 2M to repair a single cable off the coast of West Africa.  

Many large global Internet service providers are investing in cable systems across all regions to provide diversity and increase the security of services for customers. However, it’s also up to businesses and Internet users to understand and advocate for protecting and maintaining these underwater threads that connect us.  

Ultimately, there is no single solution, and much will depend on risk profiles and data-critical applications.

"James Bond Villains Attempt to Cut Undersea Cables","Explores a 2013 incident where divers in Egypt were caught trying to sever submarine communications cables, threatening global internet connectivity.","https://gizmodo.com/three-crazy-james-bond-villains-were-caught-trying-to-c-5992738","2013-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","Eric Limer",Yes,"Eric Limer","New York, NY 10104, United States",-,"2013-03-28","English","Gizmodo","**Three Crazy James Bond Villains Were Caught Trying to Cut Through The Internet's Undersea Cables**

While the Internet at large was freaking out about an apocalyptic attack that wasn't really happening yesterday, something nefarious was going down at the bottom of the sea. Egyptian authorities found a trio of divers down there attempting to sever a crucial submarine communications cable.

Yesterday, Egypt's Coast Guard stumbled upon a suspicious fishing boat off the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria. There's no word on what tipped them off, but upon investigation, they caught the team of divers up to no good and apparently mid-cut. The cable in question is owned by Egypt Telecom, the country's monopoly landline provider, making it sort of an important link in the vast network of undersea Internet connections.

The Official Military Spokesman of the Armed Forces of Egypt put it this way in a statement on Facebook:

> [The] Navy today successfully foiled 3 divers, while they cut submarine cable for connection to the Internet, the company's Telecom Egypt, near the coast of Shatby in Alexandria ... [The] Navy chased Bnas fishing which was launched from three divers, and arrested all crew members and handed them over to the border guards to take the necessary legal action against them.

And whatever they were up to, it was a good first step to serious Internet destruction. If you were out to really cripple the beast like some cartoon mastermind, cutting the cables would be your go-to first step, second only to destroying more guarded land-based nodes. The 'net's web of undersea cables is a verifiable weakness, considering they're both hard to effectively guard and necessarily act as chokepoints.

So far, there's no explanation for what the divers' nefarious plan was, but it's possible they also had something to do with previously unexplained disruptions to undersea cables serving Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia over the past several days. And coordinated cable cutting—if that was the plan—could seriously cripple the Internet for quite a while.

So worry all you want about DDoS attacks, but there are physical targets for Internet attacks as well. You just have to be sort of a James Bond-style villain to get to them.","The article discusses the attempted cutting of submarine communications cables by divers in Egypt, directly mentioning 'submarine communications cable' and 'undersea cables.'

TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Telecom companies quickly cobbled together new telephone and Internet networks on Thursday as Asia began recovering from a Taiwanese earthquake that snapped undersea cables, snarling service across the tech-savvy region.

Less than 48 hours after the powerful quake ruptured the two crucial cables off Taiwan's southern tip, companies from South Korea to Singapore said they managed to partially restore most of their service to millions of customers.

They did it by rerouting traffic through satellites and cables that weren't damaged by the 6.7-magnitude tremor that killed two people.

Four repair ships were sailing to the quake zone, but they weren't expected to arrive until Tuesday, said Lin Jen-hung, vice-general manager of Chunghwa Telecom Co., Taiwan's biggest phone company.

The crews would need to find the fault, survey the conditions and pull up the cables for repair – a job Chunghwa said could take two weeks.

Most international Internet data and voice calls travel as pulses of light through hundreds of undersea fiber optic cables crisscrossing the globe. The cables – clusters of glass fibers enclosed in protective material – are often owned by groups of telecom companies, who share costs and capacity.

""Cables break all over the place, from sharks nibbling, anchors dragged across,"" said Markus Buchhorn, an information technology expert at Australia National University.

But Buchhorn added the broken cables become a problem if – like in the Taiwanese case – several snap at the same time and there are not immediate backup lines to keep the traffic flowing.

Chunghwa estimated its revenue loss from the earthquake damage at about $3 million. Repairing the cables would cost about $1.53 million, the company said in a filing to the Taiwan Stock Exchange.

The outage reminded stock traders, travelers and online video gamers how addicted they've become to the Internet.

""Many lost the opportunity to make fast money,"" said Francis Lun, general manager at Fulbright Securities in Hong Kong.

""I haven't experienced anything like this before,"" Lun added. ""We've become too dependent on these optic fibers – a few of them get damaged, and everything collapses.""","The article titled ""Asia Slowly Recovers From Telecom Outage"" discusses the impact of a Taiwanese earthquake that snapped undersea cables, leading to significant disruptions in telecommunications across Asia.

Millions of people were affected by the breakdown in the main fibre-optic link beneath the Arabian Sea 35 kilometers (21 miles) south of Karachi, which was detected late Monday, officials and Internet service providers said.

The complex repair work may require a complete shut down, potentially causing disruption in India, the United Arab Emirates, Djibouti and Oman, which are also linked to the damaged cable, officials said.

""This is a highly sophisticated operation and only specialised companies can undertake such a delicate task under the sea,"" Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) chief engineer Shahid Ahmed told AFP.

""Pakistan has no such ability.""

The cable is owned by a consortium of 92 countries with Singtel of Singapore acting as its operating agents. Singtel this month lost out on a bid for a key stake in the privatisation of state-run PTCL.

""We are holding a multilateral conference to fix the problem and asked Singtel to arrange for the rectification of the fault,"" Ahmed said.

He said Singtel has appointed E-Marine, a UAE-based company, to fix the fault. They had dispatched a ship which may take 18 to 24 hours to reach the site, he added.

Pakistan has more than 10 million Internet users, general secretary of Internet Service Providers (ISP) Association, V.A. Abdi said.

""I fear it could take two weeks to repair because it will require the removal of the faulty portion of the cable,"" Abid told AFP.

""The cable provides Pakistan's major outer communication means and its fault has disrupted almost all communications with the rest of the world.""

The cable fault is the latest problem to hit Pakistan's long-suffering telecoms users.

Services were affected earlier this month when tens of thousands of workers went on strike to protest at the privatisation of PTCL. At one point troops and police seized control of the firm's premises.

However the sell-off went ahead on June 18, with Pakistan selling a 26 percent stake in PTCL for 2.59 billion dollars to Etisalat of the UAE.

"Robot Repairs Undersea Cables to Restore Internet Connectivity","Automated repairs of undersea cables reduce downtime and restore broadband services after breaks, enhancing global internet reliability.","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/technology/robot-fixes-internet-undersea-cable-5199871","2015-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","Olivia Solon",Yes,"Olivia Solon","London, United Kingdom","4250","2015-02-20","English","Daily Mirror","Submarine cables power the internet, but what happens when one breaks?

Earlier this month, some people in Northern Ireland started seeing their broadband speeds slow right down. How come? Well it turns out that an undersea fibre optic cable that supplies Northern Ireland with Virgin Media's broadband had broken. Fixing it would involve a crack team of specialist engineers, a boat and a robot.

97% of the world’s communications are carried by underwater cables. There are 277 globally, more than 20 of which connect to the UK. Unfortunately, they can easily be torn by earthquakes, ships' anchors or trawler nets used in fishing. When that happens, they need repairing. Quickly.

That's where Peter Jamieson comes in. He's the lead engineer at Virgin Media and will be the first to be alerted when there’s a problem with one of the company’s two fibre optic cables in the Irish Sea. If there's ever a breakage - and there have been two for the company in 7 years - the signal between the two ends of the cable will be disrupted, triggering an alarm.

""We’ll send out an engineer to both ends of the cable within about 30 minutes,"" says Jamieson. The engineer will carry out tests that will reveal the distance along the cable where the tear is. ""Then I call out a repair ship, which mobilises in about an hour,"" he says. ""Every cable damaged is an emergency, so we’ll try to fix it as quickly as we can.""

In this case, the ship called was the 100m-long Pierre de Fermat - which is shared by a consortium of companies that rely on undersea cables. Once the ship reaches the right spot - which can take several days depending on where it's docked - the robot steps in.

The Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) is dropped down into the water to inspect the damage. Once it's found the break point, it will raise both sides of the cable to the surface so that engineers can repair it. The entire cable is just 6cm in diameter. Inside the cable are 48 fibres, each of which is capable of taking eighty-eight 100 gigabit channels. ""One cable could take all the traffic from the UK,"" he adds.

The engineers take time to carefully splice in a new section of cable, connecting all of the fibres together. ""That’s the bit you've got to get right - it has to be perfect every time,"" he says. ""Once you put it back on the seabed you don’t want to go back again.""

Once it's fixed, the robot returns the cable to the seabed and buries it. The fibre is back in business, and Northern Irish customers can go back to enjoying cat videos.","The article discusses undersea cables in detail, including specific incidents of breakage affecting broadband services.

Grappling and dragging techniques used in ongoing efforts to repair undersea optic fibre cables damaged in the December 26 Taiwan quake that disrupted Internet services for millions of users in the Asia-Pacific region.

Workers are relying on 19th century technology to fix a very 21st century problem -- disruption of the Internet traffic that tech-savvy Asia relies on. Crewmen on boats south of Taiwan are dragging the seabed with grappling hooks at the end of long ropes to recover fibre optic cables damaged in a 7.1-magnitude earthquake that struck the region on December 26.

""No electronics involved,"" said John Walters, general manager of Global Marine, one of the firms engaged in the repairs. ""It's an old and traditional technique.""

Millions of people across the region, in Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and as far away as Australia, suffered Internet and telephone blackouts when the cables, linking Asian countries with the US and beyond, were damaged.

Telecom operators have diverted the traffic to allow service to return to normal but the repair work continues.

""At this point none of those cables have been repaired,"" Walters told AFP in an interview.

Global Marine has two ships in the Bashi Channel and Luzon Strait area, between Taiwan and the Philippines, while other firms have provided four more ships, he said.

The vessels, specially designed to repair submarine cables, are more than 100 metres long and carry about 60 British officers and Filipino crewmen.

After arriving at the scene they survey the ocean bottom to assess whether the contour has changed, and the degree of sediment movement.

Once the severed half of the cable is on board the boat, debris is cleared from the damaged end, it is tested, sealed and the end boiled off. Then it is attached to a buoy on the water surface while the process is repeated for the second half of the cable before both halves are spliced together and dropped back to the ocean floor.

A single cable repair can take about seven days but on this mission, most operators are quoting a 10-day repair period. With about eight separate cable systems in the waters off Taiwan, and close to 18 faults caused by the earthquake, repairs will take time.

**Published Date:** 02/06/2023  

The lines that tie the globe together by carrying phone calls and Internet traffic are just two-thirds of an inch thick where they lie on the ocean floor.  
The foundation for a connected world seems quite fragile - an impression reinforced this week when a break in two cables in the Mediterranean Sea disrupted communications across the Middle East and Asia.  
India took one of the biggest hits, and the damage from its slowdowns and outages rippled to some U.S. and European companies that rely on its lucrative outsourcing industry to handle customer service calls and other operations.  
Yet the cable network itself is fairly resilient. In fact, cables are broken all the time, usually by fishing lines and ship anchors, and few of us notice. It takes a confluence of factors for a cable break to cause an outage.  
""Most telecom companies have capacity at multiple systems, so if one goes out, they simply reroute to a different system,"" said Stephan Beckert, analyst at research firm TeleGeography in Washington. ""It's just that in this case, both the main route and the backup route got cut for a lot of companies.""  
The two cables - FLAGEurope-Asia and SeaMeWe-4 - were cut on the ocean floor just north of Alexandria, Egypt. There was speculation a ship's anchor might be to blame.  
Egyptian officials said initial attempts to reach the cables were stymied by poor weather. Repairs could take a week once workers arrive at the site, and engineers were scrambling to reroute traffic to satellites and to other cables.  
By an accident of geography and global politics, Egypt is a choke point in the global communications network, just as it is with global shipping. The reasons are the same: The country touches both the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, which flows into the India Ocean.  
The slim fiber-optic cables that carry the world's communications are much like ships, in that they're the cheapest way for carrying things over long distances. Pulling cable overland is much more expensive and requires negotiation with landowners and governments.  
So fiber-optic cables that go from Europe to India take the sea route via Egypt's Suez Canal, just as ships do.  
Another Mediterranean cable makes land not far away, in Israel. But there's no cable overland from Israel into Jordan and to the Persian Gulf, which could have provided a redundant connection for the Gulf States and India. Going overland would have been more expensive and politically difficult - Israel and Arab countries would have to cooperate.  
There is also no route that goes through Russia, Iran and Pakistan to India. The terrain is rugged, Pakistan is politically unstable, and India and Pakistan are not on good terms.  
With two of the three cables passing through Suez cut, traffic from the Middle East and India intended for Europe was forced to route eastward, around most of the globe.  
The main route goes through Japan and the United States, crossing both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. According to Beckert, this is normally the cheap way to go for Indian traffic, because capacity is high. However, the distance means more time required to reach Europe and get a response.  
The other route from India to Europe goes over China into Russia and along the Trans-Siberian railroad.  
Egypt is not the only choke point in the global network. The ocean just south of Taiwan proved to be one in December 2006, when an earthquake cut seven of eight cables passing through the area, slowing down communications in Hong Kong and other parts of Asia for months.  
Another possible vulnerability is the U.S. island of Guam in the Pacific Ocean. It is the spider at the center of a web of cables from the United States, Japan, Australia, the Philippines and China.  
Both cables that connect the United States to Australia and New Zealand run over Hawaii, creating another choke point.  
These bottlenecks are likely to go away, however, as telecoms build more lines. But it will be years before the network across Asia is as resilient as the trans-Atlantic network, where multiple high-capacity lines over different routes provide a connection that's almost impossible to disrupt. And the factors that make the Suez Canal a vulnerable point now will likely remain.  
Mustafa Alani, head of the security and terrorism department at the Gulf Research Center in Dubai, said the outage should be a ""wake-up call"" for governments and professionals to divert more resources to protect vital infrastructure.  
""This shows how easy it would be to attack"" communications networks, he said.  
Yet the owners of the undersea cables aren't concerned with terrorism, according to Beckert. They're too busy worrying about fishing boats.  
""They want to publish maps of their cables as widely as possible, so fishing crews know where they are,"" Beckert said. ""The risk of accidental cuts is much, much greater than the risk of deliberate cuts.""

Submarine cables form the backbone of international communication, responsible for 99 percent of international data traffic. These cables are more feasible than satellites in terms of data transmission due to their high-capacity and low-latency. In an era where digital connectivity is the lifeblood of economies and societies, submarine cables play a pivotal role in facilitating seamless communication, commerce, and collaboration on a global scale.

In the context of global supply chains, the importance of submarine cables cannot be overstated, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, a bustling hub of trade and economy. Despite their critical role, submarine cables are vulnerable to both intentional and unintentional damage. Attacks can be physical due to human activities or cyberattacks targeting cable landing stations.

**Physical security risks**

Submarine cables face various physical security risks, including accidental damage from ship anchors, fishing activities, intentional sabotage, and natural disasters. In 2023, notable cases of cable damage were reported in the waters of Guam, Taiwan, Vietnam, and the Solomon Islands. A significant incident occurred in February 2023 when all five submarine cables connecting Vietnam malfunctioned simultaneously, impacting data flow and internet speed.

**Cybersecurity risks**

Submarine cables are also prone to cyberattacks or espionage, with increased competition between state and non-state actors highlighting their vulnerability. The geopolitical headwinds in the Indo-Pacific suggest that these cables could readily become targets, potentially undermining global supply chains and stability. 

Repairing submarine cables is time-consuming and costly, with an average repair time of 40 days and costs ranging from USD 1-3 million. The global shortage of cable-laying and repair ships exacerbates the situation, as many vessels are aging and unable to keep pace with the growing demand for submarine cable construction.

**Conclusion**

The increased utilization of grey-zone tactics amidst geopolitical tensions suggests that submarine cables will continue to face significant risks, necessitating enhanced protection measures to safeguard this critical infrastructure.","The article discusses submarine cables, which are synonymous with cut sea cables, and details their vulnerabilities, including risks of damage from human activities and cyberattacks.

It provides specific examples, such as the simultaneous malfunction of five submarine cables in Vietnam and incidents of cable damage near Taiwan.

The implications of these damages on internet connectivity and global supply chains are thoroughly explored, making the topic a central theme of the article."

Finnish authorities investigating a severed undersea power cable said over the weekend that they discovered a 60-mile-long anchor drag mark on the seafloor — which they say is linked to a Russia-affiliated vessel.

The Baltic Sea power cable that runs between Finland and Estonia was damaged last week, along with multiple data cables.

Authorities believe the vessel, Eagle S, is part of Russia's ""shadow fleet,"" a network of ships with uncertain ownership used to evade Western oil sanctions imposed over the war in Ukraine. The ship was seized by Finland as it continues its investigation.

It's the latest in a string of incidents that have raised alarm bells across Europe, amid fears that Russia is conducting acts of sabotage against European infrastructure in response to EU support for Ukraine.

NATO, meanwhile, has promised more military reinforcement in the Baltic Sea.

The Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment. Russia has denied involvement in previous similar incidents.

### How the latest incident unfolded

On Christmas Day, an undersea power cable connecting Finland and Estonia, known as the Estlink-2, was severed, cut in an area where the seabed is difficult to access naturally.

Finnish authorities detected the damage during routine monitoring and quickly launched an investigation.

Late Sunday, Finnish police chief investigator Sami Paila told Finnish National Broadcaster Yle that police discovered an anchor drag trail extended for ""dozens of kilometers ... if not almost 100 kilometers (62 miles),"" suggesting deliberate actions.

This disruption, although having little immediate impact on services, has underscored the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure in the Baltic Sea.

The incident also followed damage to two data cables in November and bombings of the Nord Stream gas pipelines in 2022. Investigators of those incidents have said the cables and pipelines were deliberately targeted.

### The ship detained by Finland passed over the cables, investigators say

Finnish investigators have detained the Eagle S, a 70,000-ton crude oil tanker registered in the Cook Islands.

The vessel was operating in the vicinity of the cables at the time of the incident and had set off from Russia the day before. Finnish authorities said they noticed the Eagle S had slowed down as it passed over the cables at around the same time that the incident occurred.

Finland's National Bureau of Investigation on Saturday said it was investigating the ship under criminal charges including aggravated criminal mischief and aggravated interference of communications. It also said the ship's crew members were being questioned.

Authorities confiscated material from the ship for analysis, a process they said could take several months to complete.

### European leaders condemned the incident but have yet to publicly blame Russia

European leaders have condemned the incident, emphasizing the urgency of protecting critical infrastructure.

""Undersea cables and pipelines connecting our countries across the Baltic Sea have been there for years without any major incidents nor damages,"" Lauri Läänemets, Estonia's interior minister, told NPR, adding: ""It is highly unlikely, even naïve to think that 3 such incidents in just a year could be merely a coincidence.""

Läänemets was cautious about directly blaming Russia for this latest incident as Finland continues its investigation, but he did say Europe needed ""to take decisive steps sanctioning Russia's shadow fleet operating on the Baltic Sea.""

Undersea cables provide a large source of electricity to Estonia and other Baltic states. Fingrid, Finland's electricity transmission operator, said the repair could take months and warned the cable cut risked making it ""more likely that the power situation will become tight"" for Estonians.

Finland and Estonia promptly called on NATO to bolster its presence in the Baltic Sea.

NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte announced plans to enhance military operations in the region, including naval patrols.

But some accuse the EU of not being quick enough.

""We have been too slow in our action,"" Marko Mihkelson, the chair of the Estonian Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, told NPR on Friday, referring to the EU's failure to respond to previous similar incidents.

In November, two fiber-optic Baltic Sea cables were severed. German officials called it sabotage and the Danish navy stopped a Chinese cargo ship that passed over both cables.

In October 2023, a Chinese ship dragged its anchor hundreds of miles, destroying undersea cables and an undersea gas line connecting Finland and Estonia. China said its ship was responsible but said it was an accident.

""We said after the NATO membership of Sweden and Finland, that the Baltic Sea is like a NATO lake. Is it? What can we do to secure critical infrastructure?"" Mihkelson said, adding he would ""like to see more robust action from the side of NATO.""

The European Commission has proposed targeted sanctions against Russia's shadow fleet. These measures aim to deter future sabotage and reduce the fleet's impact on global security and the environment.

### What to know about Russia's alleged ""shadow fleet""

Russia's shadow fleet refers to a network of older vessels used to evade Western sanctions and, allegedly, conduct covert operations. The ships take steps to sell Russian oil while concealing its origin.

These tankers often operate without Western-regulated insurance and employ tactics such as signal jamming to hide their movements. Many are registered under foreign flags to obscure their origins.

Following the European Union's price cap on Russian oil, nearly 70% of Russia's oil exports are now transported by these fleets, according to a European Parliament briefing.

Analysts believe the Kremlin has invested billions to expand this network, with the alleged covert operations being used to create instability across Europe.

""Russia has dramatically stepped up its game in its operations against democratic European countries,"" Janne Riihelainen, a national security columnist for multiple Finnish news outlets, told NPR.

He added: ""Russia is stepping up pressure against the West amid its continued support for Ukraine by trying to disrupt the lives of everyday people.","The article titled ""What to know about Finland, Russia and a severed undersea cable"" discusses the severing of the Estlink-2 undersea power cable connecting Finland and Estonia.

It details the investigation into the incident, linking it to a Russian-affiliated vessel and highlighting the implications for European infrastructure security.

The article mentions the cut cable as a central theme, discussing its impact on electricity supply and the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure in the Baltic Sea.

Marcus: more often than you’d think. Also from what I know the first 2 cables got cut at the same time so I assume they were damaged by the same cause (anchor from a ship apparently).

John Gear: Well, if you read “Blind Man’s Bluff” about US undersea operations, you’d know how this stuff happens. The question is whether this has anything to do with preparing for an upcoming US attack on Iran.

Paul: Sea cables often rip apart. Around the world such a cable breaks every few days. Usually the public only takes notice when multiple breaks occur at a single place like next to Taiwan some years ago.

On the recent cable ruptures: There was a bad weather system in the south-east Mediterranean which then moved eastwards to the Gulf. It first ripped apart two lines a few miles off Alexandria, Egypt. Because two lines broke at the same time, the public took notice.

The line breaks may have been through ships slipping/dragging in the storm with anchors down in relatively shallow water or simply by sea ground waves. Alexandria is known as a critical point of failure for global internet traffic because too many sea cables are landing there without structural redundancy.

As the bad weather moved east, a line off Dubai broke. This is the third line that has you wondering. According to FLAG Telecom, the cable owner, traffic on the Persian Gulf system is mostly restored despite that cut.

There are currently some rumors on conspiracy sites that say a fourth cable is cut in the Gulf and Iran’s internet is down. These rumors are definitely FALSE AND UNFOUNDED!

**Published Date:** November 20, 2024  
**Author:** Emmet Lyons  

Two undersea cables carrying internet data deep in the Baltic Sea were damaged, European telecommunications companies said this week, drawing warnings from European governments of possible Russian ""hybrid warfare"" targeting global communications infrastructure.

On Wednesday, interest was focused on a Chinese-flagged cargo ship called the Yi Peng 3, which data provided by the maritime tracking service Vessel Finder showed to have been in the area around the time the cables were damaged.

The Yi Peng was anchored Wednesday in Danish waters, and Denmark's military confirmed in a brief statement that it had a presence near the vessel, offering no further information. Vessel Finder tracking data showed a Danish navy patrol ship close to the anchored cargo vessel.

According to data from Vessel Finder, the bulk carrier, owned by Chinese firm Ningbo Yipeng Shipping Co. Ltd, departing from the remote northwest Russian port of Ust-Luga on Nov. 15, with a scheduled Dec. 3 arrival at Egypt's Port Said.

Speaking to reporters Wednesday in Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied any Russian involvement in the cables being damaged, calling it ""quite absurd to continue to blame Russia for everything without any grounds."" Peskov suggested Ukraine could have been behind sabotaging the cables.

The Finnish company Cinia confirmed that its submarine cable between Finland and Germany was damaged in the early hours of Monday morning. The cable is about 730 miles long and connects telecommunications networks in central Europe to Finland and other Nordic countries.

""The details of the fault are yet not known and are currently being investigated,"" the company said in a statement on its website.

The foreign ministers of Finland and Germany said in a joint statement Monday that a cable connecting the two countries had been cut and that the incidents had raised suspicion of possible sabotage.

""A thorough investigation is underway. Our European security is not only under threat from Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, but also from hybrid warfare by malicious actors,"" the ministers said, without blaming any particular entity for the possible sabotage.

Swedish company Arelion confirmed to CBS News on Tuesday that one of its cables had also been damaged, on Sunday morning.

""We can confirm that one of our subsea fiber cables — the one between Gotland, Sweden and Šventoji, Lithuania — is damaged. The issue was detected on November 17, and we currently do not know what caused it as we have not been able to examine the cable,"" Arelion spokesperson Martin Sjögren told CBS News.

""Arelion is in contact with Swedish authorities and the Swedish Armed Forces regarding the incident. The cable will be repaired over the next few weeks depending on weather conditions,"" he said.

The Swedish Prosecutor's office confirmed to CBS News Wednesday that there was an ongoing investigation into ""sabotage in the Baltic sea."" In a separate statement, Sweden's national police force confirmed it was, ""also interested in a ship seen at the locations in question. It [the ship] is not currently in Swedish waters.""

""If I had a nickel for every time a Chinese ship was dragging its anchor on the bottom of the Baltic Sea in the vicinity of important cables I would have two nickels, which isn't much, but it's weird that it happened twice,"" Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said in a statement posted on social media.

Audrius Stasiulaitis, a spokesperson for the Swedish multinational telecom company Telia, which uses and operates the Arelion cable, said Tuesday that the company believed the cable had been physically damaged.

""We can only speculate on what has happened, but as far as we see, it is not affected by equipment failure and we presume it's physical damage,"" he told CBS News over the phone.

The damage to the cables comes after reports over the past year that Russia may be targeting key infrastructure connecting Nordic countries.

An April 2023 joint investigation by the public broadcasters of Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland found that Moscow was operating a fleet of suspected intelligence vessels in Nordic waters as part of a Kremlin campaign potentially aimed at targeting underwater cables and wind farms.

There have been attacks on European infrastructure since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine 1,000 days ago.

In September 2022, the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines, both designed to carry natural gas from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea, were damaged by explosions.

Both Ukraine and Russia denied any involvement in the explosions. In August, German media reported that prosecutors had issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian man over the pipeline attacks.

Sweden and Finland have both joined the NATO military alliance over the past two years, as the war in Ukraine fuels concern about Russia's possible intentions, and just this week, both countries updated their war preparation guidance and published online booklets for citizens to prepare for the eventuality of a war or other crisis.","The article titled ""Undersea cables cut or damaged, leading European nations to investigate possible sabotage"" discusses the damage to undersea cables in detail.

A cable fault that caused a major blackout of internet services across West Africa has been repaired. The damage was discovered 25km (15 miles) off the coast of Benin on a branch of the SAT-3 cable, which connects Europe to South Africa. 

The fault knocked out 70% of Nigeria's bandwidth, causing severe problems for its banking sector, government and mobile phone networks. Services were severely disrupted or knocked out in Togo, Niger and Benin. 

Countries had to either reroute traffic overland or use expensive satellite links to maintain connectivity. Nigeria was particularly badly hit because around 70% of its bandwidth is routed through neighbouring Benin. 

The network, run by Suburban Telecom, was set up to bypass Nigeria's principal telecoms operator Nitel which runs the SAT-3 branch cable which lands in Nigeria.

MUMBAI: It was just a blip on the monitoring screens of a fortified room in Chennai, but a full-blown crisis 5,500 kilometres away, off the ancient city of Alexandria, Egypt. Last Wednesday, in the worldwide puppetry show called internet, a string had snapped. The Western world, with banks and factories and telephone networks to run, had just lost connection with its housekeeper and doorman, India. There was only one thing at stake: global business.

The potential danger from the two breaks in undersea cables in the Mediterranean was immense. Western businesses and customers depend on global connectivity to outsourced service providers such as India to run their daily affairs.

A disruption could have stranded them in a virtual no-man’s-land and India could have lost credibility as an always-on supplier of an ever-growing variety of services. Except that none of this happened. India and the world can thank the design of the internet, Hydra-headed as it is, to this happy turn of events. Within a few milliseconds, life was back to normal, almost.

It was not by coincidence that the breakdown in SEA-ME-WE (South East Asia, Middle East, Western Europe) and FLAG (Fibre-optic Link Around the Globe) cables that carry the bulk of data and voice traffic from India to the West left only a limited impact for businesses. It was the combined effort of a dynamic disaster recovery technology and quick intervention by machine and humans that averted a catastrophe.

“IP (Internet Protocol) networks are the new generation technology to route any traffic through any route, any time. But for this resilience, the system would have collapsed with such a cable problem,” says Internet Service Providers Association of India president Rajesh Chharia. For high-value customers such as outsourcing companies, the rerouting gets done automatically by the systems at the ISP’s hub.

For instance, at Sify’s control room in Chennai, the computers poll the global cable network, on land and under water, every 30 seconds. “It can be a powercut in Kashmir or a cable break in the Mediterranean. It takes a maximum of 30 seconds for the traffic to go on another line, say, through Singapore,” says Saji.

The real sufferers during cable breaks are the individual internet users. Their connectivity is low priority for many ISPs who derive much of their profits from companies. The benefits of dynamic rerouting don’t come free. Large users pay a premium fee to make sure cable cuts don’t stop their traffic. For the small guy, a cable break could lead to disconnection or sluggish download speeds. Despite ISP claims, the small guy took a big knock during last week’s problems.

The incident has shown that it is far too risky for a company to have its own line under the sea or subscribe to just one connection.

India lost half its Internet capacity on Wednesday when two strands of fiber as thick as a thumb snapped. While service is returning to normal, it may be weeks before the cables are repaired. The fact that a pair of central Internet paths are just 2 km apart should serve as a cautionary tale as to just how fragile the Internet can be.

TeleGeography, a company that tracks cable capacity, said the two cables ""account for the majority of international communications capacity between Europe and the Middle East."" With both cables cut, capacity has been reduced by 75 percent to only 620 Gbps. The cables also carry a considerable amount of traffic bound for India and Pakistan.

The Internet is designed to deal with outages. Its protocols are inherently resilient and can circumvent regional outages by finding new routes, but it can take hours for routers to agree on new paths around a breakage. Even once those new paths are established, they may not be as fast. In this case, the severed links were two of the fastest in the region, and now some data has to travel via satellite or across the Pacific rim.

We contacted Sef Kloninger, senior director of service performance at Akamai, to find out just how slow links became. Kloninger told us that for a 9-hour period — from 4 a.m. GMT to 1 p.m. GMT on Jan. 30 — tests from four cities in India across regular Internet connections climbed from their usual 2 to 6 seconds’ response time to as high as 15 to 30 seconds, and that those sites were only available to Indian users 50 percent of the time.

Akamai offers a service called “web application acceleration” that makes dynamic applications more responsive than they would be across such links. Kloninger said that even Akamai’s customers were momentarily disconnected following the break, but that unlike regular Internet users the company’s optimized routing algorithms detected the problem immediately and routed around it within minutes. “We saw most of the effect of routes into India, where connectivity was quite impacted,” he said.

India-to-U.S. response time is returning to normal. But Egypt’s minister of telecommunications, Dr. Tarek Kamel, expects the fix to take up to two weeks, and inclement weather is already hampering repair crews.

The fact that these two cables — which are supposed to provide redundancy — were so close together should be cause for alarm. When companies build data centers, they go to great lengths to ensure that power supply into the data center comes from multiple directions in order to avoid interruptions. But geographic and technical constraints mean some places are particularly crowded, much like modern versions of the Suez and Panama canals. And with this concentration comes vulnerability.

The cut also serves as a reminder of our increasing reliance on global internetworking. Customer service and offshore development are the obvious victims. But the Internet is so much a part of our lives that everything from Skype calls to family wire transfers were affected.

In May, hackers showed they could bring down an entire country. Massive botnets like Storm can control millions of computers with hundreds of thousands active daily. And a couple of simple cuts can leave millions digitally stranded and bring industries to a halt. As we come to depend on the Internet for more and more, we need to take a much closer look at its weaknesses.

**Update:** The BBC is reporting that a third cable in the Middle East, known as Falcon, has been cut as well. The Falcon cable won’t compound the problems of the previous two breaks, as the older Sea-M-We 3 cable is the one now carrying the bulk of data that Wednesday’s break interrupted. But conspiracy theorists are sure to start speculating.

**On March 11, 2011, Andy Palmer-Felgate** was on his way to work in England when he first heard the news. A major earthquake and tsunami, and a subsequent nuclear meltdown, had hit Japan. As the country struggled to recover after Fukushima, he knew it was time for him to get to work on a problem that probably wasn't in the news.

Palmer-Felgate is a Verizon project manager who engineers and directs submarine-cable repairs all over the world, on about 80 cables leased or owned by Verizon. In the midst of the damage and devastation, the submarine cables lying along the ocean floor, which carried voice and Internet communications into and out of Japan, had also been severed.

After Fukushima, Palmer-Felgate helped direct the cable companies and engineers to pinpoint the location of the breaks by sending a pulse from a landing station on the coast and measuring the distance to the fault. His team piloted undersea remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) to find the broken links; the operators then located, lifted, and rejoined the cables. Then they sent ROVs to blast jets of water to make a new trench to bury the cable. It took several weeks to restore the country's full connectivity, he says.

""The Japan earthquake caused a whole series of underwater landslides,"" he says. ""At least seven of our cables were buried over by several kilometers of sediment.""

Today there are over 200 submarine cables buried in the ocean worldwide, creating the backbone of the 21st-century world economy. In 2013 wireless carriers and dedicated cable installation companies will lay another 12 lines to connect even more countries. (For example, the small island country of Tonga is getting one this year.) The longest cables, stretching thousands of miles under the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, run at fantastic speeds: The total bandwidth stretching under the Atlantic runs at an amazing 19 terabits per second.

The burning question: What happens when they break, and what can we do about it?

**Building Cables**

When you send an email, a small collection of bits containing your message travels from a local server to a high-speed fiber-optic cable. These fibers, strands of glass that carry a waveform of light, move data at speeds up to 100 Gbps. One undersea cable might have hundreds of wavelengths per strand and several fibers. A submarine cable is about 0.75 to 2.5 inches in diameter, or about the thickness of three ordinary garden hoses. The longest cable, called the Southern Cross, runs under the Pacific, stretching 18,500 miles.

Most cables take several weeks to install. Surveyors must work with local fisherman, carriers, survey teams, and a number of private companies to determine the best route along the ocean floor, avoiding deep caverns and potential hazards. It takes a day to lay 80 to 90 miles of cable. In shallower waters near the shore, where there's more to go wrong, operators lay just 8 to 9 miles of cable a day.

Palmer-Felgate says the first step is to dig a trench near the shore, usually about 3 to 9 feet deep, using a huge plow dragged behind a 100-to-200-foot cable ship. The ship feeds the cable into the trench just behind the plow; sediment falls over the cable to protect it. ROVs then fire jets of water to blow more sediment to fill over the newly installed cable. (In much deeper waters, where there is less risk to the cable, engineers lay it directly on the seabed.)

Andrew Blum, the author of the book Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet, says that with each new installation, the world becomes more connected. African countries such as Nigeria and Cameroon are the center of a lot of current construction. With data speeds approaching 100 Gbps per fiber-optic strand (10,000 times faster than a 10-Mbps line to your home or workplace), it's no wonder there is an ongoing effort to link the world by submarine cable.

**Breaks Happen**

Redundancy is another reason the seafloor cable-building craze continues. On Valentine's Day, according to Internet monitoring company Renesys, a fire in Alexandria, Egypt, severed six of the submarine cables on the coast. There was a widespread Internet outage in several East African countries, including Kenya.

""That was a reminder, when the Kenyan cable went down, that you really need two or three—that one cable is not enough to build an economy,"" Blum says. ""It made everyone nervous because the cables were too close together—there is a greater risk.""

Breaks occur most often when a ship drops anchor near a submarine cable, snags the cable, and ruptures it. (Ships use maps that show the cable lines, but sometimes ignore them or forget.) Anchors cause about 70 percent of all breaks, Palmer-Felgate says. Another 10 percent come from fishermen who are unaware they're dragging up more than just tuna. Natural disasters can also cause major breakages, such as what happened in Japan.

What hasn't happened yet, according to the firm TeleGeography, is a terrorist attack—though given their status as crucial infrastructure, the cables would be tempting targets. Blum says the cables are designed for redundancy, especially in areas like L.A. and New York City, where there might be 10 lines running into multiple landing stations.

""Cutting submarine cables is as hard as cutting off all air traffic to New York,"" Blum says. ""To cut off New York, you'd have to cut at least 10 cables. There is still a possibility to bring traffic in around Asia and Europe. You could isolate a place like Australia or a Pacific island. If you succeed in cutting five cables, you'd be perceived as cutting off the global economy. Unless you were fully successful, you'd have negligible impact."" Palmer-Felgate says companies like Verizon install multiple submarine cables and automatically reroute web traffic when a break occurs.

Although there have not been attacks, these cables are at the center of national security disputes. For example, the proposed $300 million trans-Atlantic Hibernian Express project is delayed because of rising cybersecurity tensions between China and the U.S.

**Diversify, Diversify, Diversify**

The real problem with undersea cables and infrastructure security is not that cables break and need to be repaired. Most of the experts said natural disasters will continue to break undersea cables and ships will drop anchor in the wrong places. Instead, Blum says, the real issue has to do with a lack of diversity on the Internet.

""There is no doubt that as more and more things connect to the Internet, everything becomes the Internet,"" Blum says. ""The best way to embrace the health and safety of the Internet is to embrace the 'inter'—to embrace this network of networks. The more networks there are, the more robust it is. The greatest risk is any single network getting too large. It is the Googles and the Verizons and the Comcasts that are the greatest risk to the Internet,"" he says, because having so few companies in control means you lose checks and balances.

The Internet should not be viewed as a single holistic thing. It is a place with great diversity, with many different ideas and people groups. The diversity is what ensures safety and redundancy, he says. The more a network spreads out, like a contagion that crosses geographic boundaries, the more powerful it becomes. That's ultimately the goal: more lines and more companies involved.

As for Palmer-Felgate, there is no question his team will keep repairing undersea cables. In the U.S. there might only be one fault per year, but in other countries, say, off the eastern coast of China in winter, there may be one cable break per week. In a world wrapped by 1000-mile fiber strands, breaks are a way of life.

""Engineers are constantly working to improve the armoring of cables, improve the routing of cables to avoid fault-prone areas, and bury cables more,"" says Alan Mauldin, a researcher at TeleGeography. ""I am not sure you can ever engineer something that is 100 percent reliable, but cables are very reliable if you consider the harsh environments in which they operate.","The article discusses various aspects of submarine cables, including specific incidents of cable damage, particularly in the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster, where multiple cables were severed.

**An Analysis of Taiwan's Undersea Cable Network Resilience**  
Charles Mok, Kenny Huang  
July 29, 2024  

**1. Overview**  
In an era defined by global digital connectivity, Taiwan stands as a crucial node in the international Internet infrastructure, supported by a comprehensive network of 15 undersea cables plus other satellite connections. This robust setup underpins Taiwan's digital connectivity with the world. However, this dependence on external, often fragile, infrastructure exposes Taiwan to various threats, including natural disasters, cyberattacks, and geopolitical conflicts.  

We examine the current landscape of Taiwan’s Internet infrastructure, outlining the challenges it faces in maintaining resilience in an ever-evolving digital environment. We explore existing governance frameworks and policy considerations essential for addressing these challenges. Additionally, we analyze technological solutions designed to enhance Taiwan's Internet resilience, focusing on advanced technologies that can improve cybersecurity and ensure redundancy in network architecture.  

Our recommendations involve strengthening governance mechanisms and enhancing investment incentives to better manage these vulnerabilities and leveraging international cooperation and partnerships to fortify Taiwan’s digital defenses. By proactively addressing these challenges and fostering collaboration opportunities, Taiwan can transform its vulnerabilities into strategic advantages, securing a sustainable and resilient digital future.

**2. Why are Undersea Cables Important for Taiwan?**  
In today’s ubiquitous and wireless digital environment, it is easy to forget the importance of the physical infrastructure behind all the devices and applications we interface with on a daily basis, and the people and services we communicate with across the world. Indeed, as of early 2024, over 570 active and planned undersea cables are in service around the world, carrying over 99% of intercontinental data transmission.  

At present, Taiwan is connected to the world via a 15 subsea cable system. Together, they provide over 100 Tbps of Internet bandwidth, supporting one of the highest Internet penetration rates in the world at 90.7%, or 21.71 million Internet users.  

**3. The Vulnerability of Undersea Cables Networks**  
To understand the fragility of undersea cable networks, let us look at what these cables are, and how they work.  
Modern undersea cables are made of optical fibers, a flexible glass or plastic fiber that can transmit pulses of light from one end to another. These fibers are wrapped in layers of plastic or steel wires for protection.  

However, cable damages still happen. Some are caused by natural disasters, or accidents caused by human activities, but others may be due to intentional attacks.  

**Conclusion**  
Taiwan, for its own sake just as for the world’s, must be kept online. In the following discussion, we will include a number of recommendations to Taiwan’s government and society to foster more deliberation about this important issue, in order to improve our resilience for our undersea cable infrastructure, as well as for our overall digital society.","The article 'Strengthening Taiwan's Critical Digital Lifeline' discusses the importance of undersea cables for Taiwan's internet infrastructure, detailing their vulnerabilities and the implications of their potential disruption.

It mentions 'undersea cables' and 'submarine cables' extensively, providing context about recent disruptions and their impact on connectivity.

The official culprit remains unknown but telecom firms believe tropical storms have ruptured the cables.

Three internet cable systems that connect Vietnam with the rest of the world have all gone down, an internet service provider said on Sunday.

The source said “problems” have occurred on three submarine cables, the notorious Asia America Gateway (AAG), the Intra Asia (IA) and SEA-ME-WE3 (SMW3), the world’s longest telecoms cable that connects Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Western Europe.

Their connections to Vietnam have been ruptured, the representative said, without giving further details.

No official statement has been made on either the causes of the disruption or their repair schedule, according to local media reports.

But telecom firms believe tropical storms in the South China Sea, known as the East Sea in Vietnam, were to blame. Tropical Storm Pakhar brought strong winds and heavy rain to Hong Kong and Macau on Sunday, just four days after Hato, one of the strongest typhoons on record, pounded the region and killed at least 12 people.

SMW3, the world's longest internet submarine cable, has lost connection with Vietnam. 

SMW-3 was completed in late 2000 and runs 39,000 kilometers (24,200 miles), linking Vietnam's central coastal city of Da Nang. Vietnam’s internet users have reportedly encountered no problems with the 320Gbps system in recent years.

The other two cables, which have been in use since 2009, had their Vietnam connection to the southern beach town of Vung Tau disrupted several times this year. AAG accounts for 60 percent of internet connections in Vietnam.

Service providers said they have backup routes to maintain proper internet connections.

Vietnam now has six submarine cable systems, including Asia Africa Europe 1 which was launched last month, connecting 19 countries in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. The country also has a 120 gigabit/second channel that runs overland through China.

As Reuters first reported, Egyptian Coast Guard officials caught three divers who were in the midst of cutting undersea Internet cables.

The cables belonged to Telecom Egypt, Reuters said. It does not appear that the company has addressed the incident; at this point, it has only posted on its Facebook page a link to a news story about the capture of the divers.

The report comes several days after cable operator Seacom experienced an outage in Southern and Eastern Africa.

Seacom said in a Wednesday statement that its SW4 cable system ""suffered a cable cut off the coast of Egypt,"" prompting the service disruption, but ""all services on both SMW4 and IMEWE cable systems"" have since been restored.

In an updated statement this morning, Seacom said it had received multiple queries about the divers captured by Egyptian authorities. At this point, however, ""the investigation is in its early stages and nothing is as yet confirmed in regard to the cause of the damage to SMW-4.""

Still, Seacom said that sabotage is an unlikely reason for its recent outage, due to ""the specific location [of the affected cable], distance from shore, much greater depth, the presence of a large anchored vessel on the fault site which appears to be the cause of the damage, and other characteristics of the event.""

""The final cause of the cable cut will be determined once the cable is repaired in the coming weeks and the damaged section is recovered from the seabed and inspected,"" Seacom concluded.

More than two years ago, Internet access in Egypt was cut off amidst the Arab Spring uprising. Other governments in the region have used the same tactic in order to stop citizens from organizing via social networks like Facebook or Twitter or communicating with the outside world.","The article 'Egypt Captures Divers Trying to Sever Undersea Internet Cables' provides a detailed account of divers being caught while attempting to cut undersea internet cables in Egypt, specifically cables belonging to Telecom Egypt.

Subsea fiber-optic cables are a critical information and telecommunications technology (ICT) infrastructure carrying more than 95 percent of international data. They are becoming a highly consequential theater of great power competition between the United States, China, and other state actors such as Russia. The roughly 600 cables planned or currently operational worldwide span approximately 1.2 million kilometers and provide the high-bandwidth connections necessary to support the rise of cloud computing and integrated 5G networks.

Subsea cables are critical for nearly all aspects of commerce and business connectivity. For example, one major international bank moves an average of $3.9 trillion through these cable systems every workday. They are the backbone of global telecommunications and the internet, facilitating daily personal use and sensitive government communications.

Undersea cables are built, owned, operated, and maintained primarily by private sector companies. Approximately 98 percent of the world’s undersea cables are manufactured and installed by four private firms. Commercial undersea cables can be owned by a single company or a consortium.

Undersea cables can be highly vulnerable to a variety of factors. Most cable damage is unintentional, mainly stemming from accidental human interaction with the cables. Damage to submarine cables is relatively common—an estimated 100 to 150 cables are severed each year, mostly from fishing equipment or anchors.

In 2023, Taiwanese authorities accused two Chinese vessels of cutting the only two submarine cables that supply internet to Taiwan’s Matsu Islands, plunging its 14,000 residents into digital isolation for six weeks. This incident highlights the vulnerabilities of undersea cables and the geopolitical significance of safeguarding this critical infrastructure.","The article titled 'Safeguarding Subsea Cables: Protecting Cyber Infrastructure amid Great Power Competition' discusses the critical importance of undersea cables, which are essential for global telecommunications and internet connectivity.

The cable, broken since mid-October, is located deep under the sea and its repair has been repeatedly delayed due to bad weather. Originally slated to be fixed by October 20, it is now expected to be repaired between December 21 to 26, according to the Việt Nam Posts and Telecommunication Group (VNPT).

After processing the SMW-3 submarine cable, the repair vessel will travel to fix the Asia American Gateway (AAG) cable, which broke down on November 7, not long after an earlier breakdown was repaired on October 22. Since AAG will be repaired only after SMW-3, the repair date for AAG has also been delayed from December 14-18 to sometime after December 26.

The biggest cyberattack ever, triggered by a dispute between Spamhaus and Cyberbunker, was done using a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. But relatively high-tech techniques are not the only way to severely slow down the global Internet. As it turns out, you can achieve the same damage, and probably even more, with an axe.  
  
On Wednesday, three Egyptian divers were arrested when they were trying to cut off a SeaMeWe 4 undersea cable, one of the main Internet wires that connects countries throughout Europe and Asia. While their motives are still unknown, their action might be linked to a series of disruptions and severed connections suffered by SEACOM, an African submarine cable operator, in the last few weeks.  
  
SEACOM hasn't confirmed whether the previous disruptions have been caused by sabotage or perhaps just malfunctions or careless ships that inadvertently cut off cables. Whatever the case, this is not the first time that the region has suffered these types of cuts, similar incidents were reported in 2008 as well.  
  
By cutting off an undersea cable like the one the three Egyptians were attempting to sever, you can basically completely switch off 1.28 terabits of data, four times as much data used in the Spamhaus attack. Taking out a cable like that would force the data to be re-routed through some of the other redundant cables than funnel Internet bits around the world. That can cause congestion and slowdowns.  
  
You don't need to be a hacker or a deft Anonymous hacktivist to achieve widespread Internet disruption. Turn out, you might just need a scuba diving wetsuit, and an axe.

Despite being the main provider for internet traffic connection, however, Telkom said its fiber optic failure did not completely cut internet services.

""We are still trying to identify what caused the connection failure,"" Telkom spokesperson Edy Kurnia told The Jakarta Post.

""We have sent a ship and a crew directly from Singapore to investigate.""

Edy said traffic capacity would be back to speed on Saturday after the Jakarta-Singapore connection was re-routed.

He said the re-route would use an alternative fiber optic connection, a satellite connection, and digital radio transmissions.

The connection failure to Singapore happened amid already-disrupted Jakarta-Palembang fiber optic connections, which started Wednesday due to toll road construction in Palembang.

A re-routing of traffic would be temporary, Edy said.

The last time Indonesia's internet connection with the rest of the world was lost was in December 2006 when an earthquake off Taiwan measuring 7.2 on the Richter scale damaged undersea cables.

The damaged cables not only disrupted internet connections but also telephone services across Asia after connections to main servers in the U.S. were severed.

Heru Sutadi, a member of the Indonesia Telecommunication Regulatory Body, said the undersea connection could have been disrupted by an earthquake or a failure of electronic machinery.

""It could be due to decaying machines or cables,"" he said.

Some of the fiber optics used for the Jakarta-Singapore connections were from the 1990s.

Heru said new companies as well as Telkom, PT Indosat, and Excelcomindo were planning to invest in fiber optic connections, which would provide more alternatives for internet traffic and telephone connections.

Indonesian Internet Providers Association chairwoman Sylvia Sumarlin said a slowdown in connection speed was felt throughout the city but that no terminations occurred.

""Telecommunication operators and internet providers have learned from past experiences that they cannot rely solely on one route,"" she said.

""That is why when Telkom's connection is out, the backup connections automatically activate.""

To further secure connectivity to other internet hubs other than Singapore, the development of the so-called Palapa Ring Project must be accelerated.

The Palapa Ring is an ambitious project which aims to link Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, Nusa Tenggara, Sulawesi, Maluku, and Papua and eight existing network connections or backhauls through an estimated total of 35,280 kilometers undersea and 21,870 kilometers of underground fiber-optic cable.","The article discusses the failure of undersea fiber optic connections to Singapore, leading to a reduction in internet capacity for PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia.

That’s what three men tried to do in an unsophisticated but effective form of sabotage in Egypt yesterday; their identities and motives are not yet known. Reuters reports the Egyptian coastguard intercepted a fishing boat off the coast of Alexandria and arrested three men trying to cut through the SEA-ME-WE 4 undersea cable. The cable is one of the main connections between Asia and Europe, running from France to Malaysia and linking Italy, north Africa, the middle east and south Asia. The men, whose pictures the navy uploaded on Facebook, are being interrogated by Egyptian authorities.

The Internet does not live in anything resembling a cloud. Instead it resides in hundreds of cables snaking underground and along the bottom of the sea, where it is susceptible to ship anchors, marine life, and sabotage.

Most big countries have several redundant cables landing on their shores. But the loss of even a single one means that all the traffic must be jammed through remaining connections, causing congestion. And there is nothing to stop determined attackers from targeting several cables. Indeed, since many cables go through geographic chokepoints like the Suez, it wouldn’t be difficult to disrupt a whole bunch of connections in a brief period of time.

That’s exactly the kind of attack that seems to be underway. The past week saw reports of several severed cables off the coast of Egypt that are part of Seacom, a network of cables serving much of Africa. At the time, Seacom officials suspected careless ships. But the arrest of the three men yesterday suggests there could be a concerted effort to take down Egypt’s connectivity. A similar spate of cuts affected the region in 2008, though no culprit was officially established.

Yesterday’s attacks on the Internet’s infrastructure—Cyberbunker and the Egyptian cable—show two ways of waging asymmetric war in the Internet era.

Internet services have been disrupted across Asia. Internet and telephone users in Asia will have to wait at least another week before systems hit by last month's earthquake are back to normal.

Work is getting under way on undersea telecommunications cables which were damaged by the quake off Taiwan. A UK firm involved in the work said most repairs should be completed in a week to 10 days.

Traffic was switched away from the cables after the quake, but connections have been slower than normal. The magnitude 7.1 earthquake on 26 December badly damaged some eight submarine optic fibre cables on the seafloor of the Bashi channel between Taiwan and the Philippines. The cables serve Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, South Korea and Japan - all of whom suffered severe disruption to their internet and telephone networks.

UK-based Global Marine Systems is sending three of some six or seven ships that will work on retrieving the cables from the 4,000m deep sea bed and fixing them. The firm's regional director, Ian Douglas, said the earthquake had caused an unprecedented level of damage to the cables.

""Twenty-one support cable faults occurred. That's more than we would expect to see across the whole of Asia in 12 months,"" he told the BBC News website. He said the job would be extremely difficult as some cables had become trapped under the seabed or were tangled up.

""The very deep water is beyond the limits of the unmanned subs that we would normally have used,"" he said. ""Instead, we must use a kind of grappling hook - a rope with chains and hooks attached - that can be dragged along the sea bed to try and find the cable.""

He said, in some cases, up to 100km of cable may have been buried or damaged. Despite the difficulties, Mr Douglas said that by next Monday ""we hope enough cables are restored so that there will not be the current degradation in internet speeds."" He predicted it would take a week to 10 days to correct most of the faults.

Telecoms operators routed services through other means such as overland cables after the undersea cables were hit. But millions of internet and phone users from South Korea to Hong Kong have continued to encounter problems and delays.","The article titled 'Asia telecoms await quake repairs' discusses the damage caused by an earthquake to undersea telecommunications cables, specifically mentioning that eight submarine optic fibre cables were damaged in the Bashi channel between Taiwan and the Philippines.

After two undersea cable lines were mysteriously severed, Egypt's Internet situation is in dire straits. Two undersea cables in the Mediterranean were accidentally severed yesterday, cutting off much of the country's access to the outside world. 70 percent of the nation's Internet has been disconnected, according to Egypt's Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, with phone calls to Europe and the US also being disrupted. As a result, the ministry has launched an emergency task force to deal with the situation and has asked the general public to avoid downloading more bandwidth-intensive items for now to allow businesses priority.

It's not just Egypt; other countries throughout the Middle East also suffered outages, with some being completely disconnected. Both India and Egypt, which run high-volume call centers, have taken a major hit in communications because of the disruption.

The cause of the cuts remains unclear.

**Update**: Research firm TeleGeography emailed us that three international submarine cables in the Mediterranean Sea were damaged today, causing disruptions to internet and phone traffic in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, India and all of the Gulf states. TeleGeography pinpoints the faults between Tunisia and Italy, and claims the damaged cables are the FLAG Europe-Asia cable, operated by Reliance Globalcom, and two consortium cables, SeaMeWe-3 and SeaMeWe-4 owned jointly by several telecommunications companies. From the TeleGeography statement:

> The current series of faults is reminiscent of the submarine cable faults that occurred in January 2008. Today’s events have the potential to create worse disruptions: while the January 2008 accidents broke two of the three cables connecting Europe with Asia via the Middle East, Friday’s cable failures have caused faults on all three. France Telecom projects that service on all cables will be restored by December 31. Until then, many carriers in the Middle East and South Asia will need to route their European traffic around the globe, through South East Asia and across the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

It’s unknown if the Malta cable problems are related to these cuts, perhaps from a weather or seismic event. However in the online world the cuts are certainly related in how they will make it that much slower or impossible for users to connect around the world.

In a reminder of both the frailty and the flexibility of the web, the Times of Malta is reporting that last night, a submarine cable delivering traffic to subscribers of GO’s broadband service experienced a “fault.” Thousands of Maltese lost their web connections. Combine Malta’s experience with the earlier epidemic of a few undersea cables getting cut over a period of days, and a fight by Sprint and Cogent in the U.S. over peering agreements that cut off the web for some users, and it becomes clear that we should consider the web not only as physical infrastructure, but also held together by political and economic agreements.

It’s like an information superhighway, but also a like series of treaties that allow trade to various points of the globe. In Malta’s case, an agreement with Vodafone to share its cable kept the physical infrastructure from staying out. But as the Sprint/Cogent peering fight proved, when those agreements fail, the web is vulnerable in a way roads are not.","The article titled ""Optical Cable Cuts Disrupt Internet Service in India & the Middle East"" discusses significant disruptions caused by damage to three submarine cables: SEA-ME-WE3, SEA-ME-WE4, and the FLAG Europe-Asia cable.

When the world’s first transatlantic cable failed in 1858 – just three weeks after it had been inaugurated with a congratulatory telegram from Queen Victoria to US President James Buchanan – it took eight years until a replacement was operational. The cable, made of copper wires insulated with natural latex from the gutta-percha tree, probably had manufacturing faults and burnt out when its electric load was cranked up to compensate for rapidly deteriorating signal strength.

When the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami devastated Eastern Japan on 11 March 2011, it killed more than 15,000 people and destroyed roads, bridges and nuclear reactors. It also damaged around half the transpacific cables connecting the country with the rest of the world. Within just a few days, ships had started lowering remotely operated vehicles (ROV) into the sea to repair the twisted and torn fibre optic cables.

To repair fibre-optic cables at depths of 2,500m, the Kokusai Cable Ship Company Ltd (KCS), a Japanese cable installer, turned to the Marcas IV produced by a UK company, Soil Machine Dynamics. The company is a leading manufacturer of remote intervention equipment, operating in hazardous environments worldwide.

With a particular focus on subsea engineering, SMD has become a major designer and manufacturer of specialist subsea ROVs worldwide. Marcas IV, and similar high-tech ROVs, have ‘multifunctional capabilities – where one asset can do multiple tasks, working with soft ground and hard ground cables,’ says Graeme Walker, SMD’s sales manager.

In May, Global Marine Systems (GMS), a global supplier of submarine cable installation, maintenance and repair services, launched the DXr1 camera – an x-ray camera to monitor the quality of repairs of a cable joint. Its outstanding feature is that it uses digital imaging technology in place of traditional film. The camera allows a real-time review, so that it is possible to ‘make sure, right there on the ship, whether the cable is connected properly,’ says Anne Dellos LeBoutillier of GMS.

Also reducing repair time is new technology to locate and retrieve broken cable ends, for example with new grapnel hook technology that makes it possible to grab and cut cable ends simultaneously. This reduces repair time by a day or more, says Andy Palmer-Felgate, project manager in charge of cable repairs at US telecoms giant Verizon, a company that owns or leases more than 80 cables worldwide.

HÀ NỘI — Three out of four internet submarine cables linked to Việt Nam broke down on Monday, slowing down internet speed nationwide.

Viettel, one of the largest Vietnamese internet providers, confirmed the incident, saying international undersea cables AAG and Inter-Asia (IA) had developed problems in the Hong Kong sea area. AAG was down at two spots, some 66km and 85km away from the cable station in Hong Kong.

The IA cable line snapped at a location some 54km from its Hong Kong’s cable station.

The exact place where the SMW3 cable line broke down, however, is yet to be located.

Internet providers in Việt Nam failed to provide an explanation as to why all three internet cables were down at the same time and were unclear about the timeline of when the cables would be fixed.

The providers said that they would have to rely more on land cables for internet in the mean time, however, those were unlikely to meet usage demand.

The AAG line is one of the longest submarine cables in the world, stretching more than 20,000km across the Pacific Ocean to link Southeast Asia with the United States. The line accounts for up to 60 per cent of the internet connection between Việt Nam and the rest of the world.

The IA cable is some 6,800km long and connects five Asian countries and territories – Việt Nam, Singapore, the Philippines, Japan and Hong Kong.

This is the third time AAG and IA have faced problems this year.

The other broken line, SMW3, connects the three regions of East Asia, the Middle East and Western Europe with total length of 39,000km.

In one of the more ‘hands on’ examples of cyber-espionage we’ve seen in a while, Egypt’s military has reported that it’s managed to arrest three scuba divers in the process of trying to sever an undersea cable that connects the country to the World Wide Web.  
  
Speaking on the Egyptian armed forces Facebook page, Colonel Ahmed Mohammed Ali, said that a navy patrol vessel caught the three men red-handed as they were working from an inflatable dinghy, attempting to cut through the undersea cable, just north of the port city Alexandria. The claim was later verified by Telecom Egypt, the country’s largest telecommunications firm, on its official Twitter feed, and reported by several major news outlets.  
  
The incident might help to explain the patchy internet speeds reported in Egypt and neighboring countries since last Wednesday. GigaOM’s Om Malik wrote a blog yesterday explaining how the undersea cable known as “South East Asia Middle East Western Europe 4” (SEA-ME-WE 4) suffered damage just last week. It occurred at a most unfortunate moment, when two other major cables were in ‘maintenance mode’. This resulted in disruption for internet service providers across Egypt and other countries in the Indian Ocean region, with India, Pakistan, South Africa, and Kenya all reporting problems. At the time, telecoms companies blamed the damage on a “shipping accident”, but in light of yesterday’s discovery, the possibility that the earlier cut was also sabotage cannot be ruled out.  
  
Of course this begs the question – why on earth would anyone want to sabotage Egypt’s internet connection? There are certainly plenty of people around with a grudge against the country and its leaders, including political opponents of the Morsi government, Israel and Syria to name just a few, but it isn’t immediately clear what these could achieve by disconnecting the country’s internet access.  
  
Egypt’s military hasn’t yet given any details on the men arrested nor any clues as to their motivation. As of now, the men are still being interrogated.  
  
The good news at least is that internet services in Egypt are expected to be fully restored within the next 20 hours, according to Communications Minister Atef Helmy in an interview with Turkish agency Anadolu.","The article titled 'Egypt Arrests Divers ""Trying To Sabotage Undersea Cables""' directly discusses the attempted sabotage of an undersea cable in Egypt, which is a clear reference to the topic of cut sea cables.

The cable systems in question are the Intra-Asia (IA), South-East Asia - Middle East - Western Europe 3 (SMW-3) and Asia America Gateway (AAG).

Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group (VNPT), one of three major Internet service providers in Vietnam alongside FPT Telecom and Viettel, said it was looking into the problem with the AAG system as well as considering contingencies.

As of Monday morning, local providers were yet to say conclusively the nature of the problems with these cables or announce a maintenance schedule.

There is speculation that the submarine system was ruptured by consecutive tropical storms in the East Vietnam Sea over the past few weeks.

According to FPT Telecom, the SMW-3 cable system was connected to Vietnam on September 1999 and completed in late 2000.

It is led by France Telecom and China Telecom, and is administered by Singtel, a telecommunications operator owned by the government of Singapore.

The 39,000-kilometer system is the longest in the world, connecting Vietnam and 39 other countries through the landing point in central Da Nang City.

Meanwhile, the AAG is a 20,000-km submarine communications cable system connecting Southeast Asia with the U.S. mainland across the Pacific Ocean via Guam and Hawaii.

The US$560 million submarine system strikes land in Vietnam in Vung Tau City in the south, delivering up to two terabits per second.

The IA cable system was inaugurated on November 2009 with a total length of 6,800 km, linking Internet users in Vietnam, Singapore, the Philippines, Hong Kong and Japan.

The $200 million cable also makes its landing point in Vung Tau, capable of delivering up to 3.84 Tbit/s.

All major providers in Vietnam confirmed that they had backup plans in place to maintain uninterrupted international connectivity in the event of problems with any of the cables.

In late 2016, the Asia Pacific Gateway (APG) was completed with the highest Internet traffic capacity in Asia.

It was expected to offer Internet users in Vietnam a more reliable connection than the infamous AAG system, which has suffered repeated ruptures over the past few years.

Since July, VNPT and Viettel have been operating on the Asia Africa Europe 1 (AAE-1) cable system as well.

Taipei, Taiwan/Hong Kong CNN —

When a Taiwanese telecoms company detected that an international undersea cable was damaged earlier this month, it worked to divert internet traffic from the broken line to keep customers on the island connected.

But the company, Chunghwa Telecom, also went to Taiwan’s Coast Guard to report the incident – and a “suspicious vessel” observed on the same route as the affected cable, according to a statement from the company, a major local internet provider.

Taiwan Coast Guard officials in the days since have said they suspect that the Shunxin39 – a Chinese-linked cargo vessel – could have cut the cable, in an incident that has spotlighted the island’s growing concerns about vulnerabilities that could be exploited by Beijing.

Taiwan officials have not cited direct evidence that the ship damaged the cable, and the Taiwan Coast Guard said in a statement Monday that it could not determine the vessel’s intentions. It called for South Korea, the ship’s destination, to help with further investigation.

But the situation has raised concerns among Taiwanese authorities of potential “gray zone operations,” or acts that fall below the threshold of war – in particular those that could hamper the island’s internet and communications with the outside world.

Those concerns come as Taiwan has faced increasing intimidation from Beijing, which claims the self-ruled democracy as its own territory and has vowed to take control of it, by force if necessary.

They also follow a string of incidents in recent years of damage to undersea infrastructure worldwide, including communications cables. Two high-profile incidents in the Baltic Sea involved Chinese ships and remain under investigation.

Taiwan’s Coast Guard said in a statement Monday that the ship suspected of damaging the cable off its northeastern coast last Friday was a Cameroon- and Tanzania-flagged vessel, crewed by seven Chinese nationals.

The vessel is owned by Hong Kong company Jie Yang Trading Limited, which is directed by a Chinese national, a senior Coast Guard official confirmed separately to CNN. While there was no direct evidence the vessel sabotaged the submarine cable, radar showed the vessel passed by when the cable was cut, the official said.

“As of now we cannot ascertain its real intentions, but based on what we see so far, we won’t rule out the possibility of China destroying the cable through ‘gray zone operations,’” the senior official told CNN.

Such an act could be part of Beijing-backed efforts to use “ships with flags of convenience to cut Taiwan’s international communication as a form of preparation for future blockade and quarantine,” according to the official.

Beijing’s Taiwan Affairs Office said on Wednesday that submarine cable damage is a “common maritime incident,” and balked at Taipei’s “conjecturing” and “deliberate framing of gray zone threats.”

Two independent analysts told CNN that tracking data on the Shunxin39 showed atypical behavior for a cargo vessel, describing a meandering or erratic path. The ship was also found to be using two different positioning system numbers, according to the Taiwan Coast Guard, which is also seen by experts as unusual for standard cargo operations.

Chinese national Guo Wenjie, director of the company operating the vessel, denied in a statement to news agency Reuters on Wednesday that the ship was responsible for the damage.

“There’s no evidence at all,” he told Reuters by telephone. “I spoke to the ship captain and for us it was a normal trip.” CNN was unable to independently reach Guo, but public records list him as the sole shareholder of Jie Yang Trading Limited.

In 2023, Taiwanese authorities blamed two Chinese ships for damaging two submarine internet cables linked to Taiwan’s outlying island of Matsu in incidents days apart causing an internet blackout, but stopped short of saying they were deliberate acts.

Su Tzu-yun, a military expert at Taiwan’s Institute for National Defense and Security Research, said more evidence is needed to say whether the latest incident was intentional.

But he said Taiwan needs to bolster maritime surveillance and defense of submarine cables.

“Once submarine cables are sabotaged, Taiwan’s connectivity to the international community will be severed; we can then only rely on bandwidth provided by satellites, which would then affect our digital economy, international trade and banking,” he said, calling such potential sabotage a form of “psychological warfare.”

Other observers have suggested the recent incident could be part of a trial of such tactics.

“While it doesn’t look to me like part of an effort to seriously impede Taiwan’s connectivity with the world … it could be consistent with either a campaign to apply low-level harassment, or as a test run for something that could be done at a larger scale at a later date in conjunction with other coercive operations,” said Tom Shugart, a retired US Navy captain and adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security think tank in Washington.

Taiwan has seen a surge of Chinese military activities in the Taiwan Strait and the Western Pacific in recent months, in line with a ramping up of intimidation over the past few years. Chinese naval and coast guard vessels have plied regional waters, and there has been an increase in Chinese aircraft operating around the island.

But Taiwan officials and defense experts have increasingly focused on the potential for Beijing to use gray zone tactics and non-military actors like China Coast Guard and various police and maritime safety agencies – as well as a so-called maritime militia of civilian ships – to quarantine the island or play a role in a blockade if it wanted to move to take control.

In a first-of-its kind “tabletop” exercise simulating military escalations by China late last month, multiple government agencies were tasked with responding to a broader base of threats than an armed invasion, including information warfare.

One official highlighted then how government agencies struggled to clarify falsehoods during electricity or internet outages, highlighting the need for Taiwan to have a backup mechanism to ensure the flow of information.

Taiwan’s Ministry of Digital Affairs earlier this week said it has been working on initiatives aimed at strengthening Taiwan’s communications by exploring alternative internet options including low-Earth-orbit satellites and adding new submarine cable stations.

Last month, Taiwan’s tech tzar Wu Cheng-wen told reporters in a briefing that in addition to working with LEO satellite company OneWeb, the island is also in talks with Amazon’s Project Kuiper for satellite collaborations.

Those efforts may only appear more urgent to observers amid a spate of incidents where Chinese and Russian vessels have come under scrutiny.

Swedish police have sought to investigate the Chinese bulk carrier Yi Peng 3 in relation to its possible role in the breach of two undersea fiber-optic cables in the Baltic Sea in November. The incident had echoes of a 2023 case in which Chinese ship NewNew Polar Bear was suspected of damaging undersea cables as well as a gas pipeline in the Baltic.

Finnish investigators late last month seized a tanker carrying Russian oil and said they suspected the vessel had damaged the Finnish-Estonian Estlink 2 power line and several internet cables by dragging its anchor across the seabed.

Damage to submarine cables in the Red Sea last March disrupted telecoms networks in the region weeks after the official Yemeni government warned of the possibility that Houthi rebels would target the cables, though the group denied involvement.

While damage to cables is not rare and is often seen as accidental, analysts warn that the recent cases also underscore vulnerabilities.

Shugart of CNAS said that there does seem to be a number of breakages recently that seem to have been deliberate, including those done “by or for Russian or Chinese interests.”

“This is going to be a quite challenging issue to police, as most of these cables run through international waters where traditional international law allows enforcement only in very narrow areas.","The article titled 'A cut undersea internet cable is making Taiwan worried about ‘gray zone’ tactics from Beijing' directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables.

Submarine telecommunications and power cables form the backbone of global communications and energy networks. Their protection is critical to maintaining international connectivity, economic stability, and energy security. However, these cables face ongoing risk of damage from maritime activities, including commercial fishing, vessel anchoring and increasing development and human uses of the seabed.

This paper highlights the scale of the issue of damage from ships’ anchors and provides guidance on measures to mitigate anchor-related damage to submarine cables.

---

**Impact of Anchor Damage on Submarine Cables**

* Damage to submarine cables from dragged anchors account for approximately 30% of incidents each year representing around 60 faults. Damage to these cables is costly, with telecommunication repairs averaging £500k-£1m per incident and power cable repair costs reported to be in the region of £10m-£100m per incident depending on many variables. Downtime from cable damage has the potential to cause disruption to global communications and energy transmission and distribution.
* Dragged anchor incidents can happen following intentional deployment of the anchor or when the anchor deploys unintentionally while underway due to mechanical failure.
* Dragged anchors can damage multiple cables during a single event, heightening the risk of potential disruption due to multiple faults occurring at the same time.
* As well as disruption to communications or electricity networks, it can cause a backlog for repair vessels if multiple cables require repairing at the same time, therefore the impact of a dragged anchor can be more significant than a single event.
* It is worth noting that generally only those incidents which cause disruption to communications or electricity supply get media attention, however far more incidents of cable damage occur each week than is covered in the news. Therefore coverage can lead to the speculation that such incidents are uncommon or suspicious – however such incidents can be attributed to poor seamanship practices, equipment failure or improper stowage of anchors.
* It is important to highlight that there are cable ships located in strategic global locations dedicated to repairing submarine telecommunications cables.

---

**Anchors: A Leading Cause of Cable Damage**

* An ICPC White Paper published in 2011 demonstrated through use of AIS monitoring that anchors were a far more significant cause of damage than had previously been thought, where more incidents of damage had been attributed to fishing each year. This represented a marked increase in anchor-related incidents compared to earlier data.
* One of the most significant anchor drag events in recent history occurred off Sicily in 2008, where a ship dragged its anchor for 300 km, damaging six submarine cables. Such incidents can disrupt multiple cables in proximity, magnifying the impact of an event.
* Another example is the incident between the Channel Islands and Cornwall, UK where a vessel deployed anchor in poor weather, causing damage to several telecommunications cables.
* There was another incident on 17 March 2016 where a vessel dragged its anchor causing damage to telecommunications cables and a power cable, which cut off the electricity supply to the Isles of Scilly for a significant period of time.
* The Chilean flag container ship Aconcagua cut three of the then 4 cables linking the United States to Europe in 2002 while sailing from Philadelphia to New York City. The captain erroneously attributed the reduction in the ship’s speed during a gale to the wind when in fact it was the ship’s anchor dragging. Investigation revealed that the anchor windlass had only been secured with the brake and the chain stopper had not been used.
* The Liberian flagged vessel Blue Princess damaged three submarine cables in the Red Sea in 2012. Over a period of 12 hours on 17th February 2012, SEA-ME-WE 3, EASSy, and EIG, causing multiple cable faults. The vessel could be tracked using AIS as crossing the cables at a similar time as faults were reported and appeared to become fastened to the cable with the speed reducing to zero at the time of the final fault during that period.
* Several cruise ships anchored in Lyme Bay lost their anchors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The MAIB report highlighted that The International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) advises that the anchoring equipment is not designed to hold a ship of fully exposed coasts in rough weather or to stop a ship that is moving or drifting.
* An Incident in the Great Lakes, Michigan of an anchor being dragged without detection is reported as having damaged pipelines and 5 cables with the anchor having been deployed for 36 hrs covering approx. 600km causing significant damage.

---

**Accidental Anchor Deployment**

Accidental deployment of an anchor, without the crew’s knowledge, remains rare but can be possible due to the following factors:

* Anchors must be fully secured before departure using multiple securing mechanisms, including the windlass brake, bar stopper, and pelican hook/devil’s claws, tightened with bottle screws. Failure to do so can lead to unintended anchor deployment.
* Poor upkeep of anchor securing equipment increases the likelihood of accidental release.
* On large vessels, particularly those with the bridge located far aft, an anchor dropping into deep water may not be immediately detected, as it might not impact vessel steering or performance. This risk is lower on smaller vessels, where an accidental deployment is more likely to be observed.

---

**Intentional Anchor Deployment in Adverse Weather**

Intentional deployment of an anchor in rough weather can be hazardous and can lead to submarine cable damage. Key considerations include:

* Anchors are typically deployed when a vessel is stationary or nearly stationary, regardless of weather conditions.
* Deploying an anchor while a vessel is moving at full speed is extremely dangerous and is considered poor seamanship.
* If a vessel experiences an emergency such as machinery or steering failure for example near the coast, anchors may be deployed as a last resort to prevent grounding. However, past incidents have shown that cables can be broken under such circumstances.
* An anchor is not designed to hold fast on the seabed. The weight of the chain in conjunction with the anchor is there to hold the vessel, but in rough weather the vessel will move with the anchor. The ships’ watch must stay vigilant even when anchored.

**Recommendations for Mitigating Anchor Damage**

1. **Improved Vessel Practices:** All vessels should comply with proper anchor-securing protocols using approved mechanical devices. These practices must be mandatory and subject to regular inspections, by vessel owners, class and ports.

2. **Insurance:** The ICPC has pro-actively highlighted the increasing trend of damage to submarine cables by ships’ anchors to vessels’ Protection & Indemnity Clubs (P&I Clubs) through the production and distribution of a loss prevention, safety and awareness document which also advises on what can be done to prevent anchors from being deployed whilst underway.

3. **International Maritime Organisation – call to action:** The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) should consider:
   1. whether the securing of anchors prior to passage should be of a minimum standard methodology and a mandatory requirement.
   2. the introduction of interlock on anchors when secured for sea passage with an alarm on bridge.
   3. securing of the anchor for sea with the interlock or a reason why the interlock is not used should be a required entry in the vessel logbook and subject to Port State inspection.
   4. greater promulgation of the problem via ‘M’ notices (Marine Coastguard Agency) and appropriate notices worldwide.
   5. wider port inspections by the state following future submarine cable failures due to anchors.

4. **Legal and Regulatory Framework:** International law requires nations to implement the provisions of the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention (1982) by establishing domestic criminal and civil law penalties upon those who damage submarine cables wilfully or by culpable negligence. These measures all contribute to reducing avoidable cable faults and can apply to anchor-related damage to submarine cables resulting from poor practices.

**Conclusion**

Anchors dragged by vessels, especially those underway, present a significant and preventable threat to submarine cables. By enforcing stricter operational standards, leveraging technology, and enhancing crew training, the maritime community can significantly reduce the risk of damage to this critical global infrastructure. The ICPC continues to advocate for collaborative measures to protect submarine cables and ensure their resilience in the face of increasing maritime pressures.","The article titled 'Damage to Submarine Cables from Dragged Anchors' discusses the significant threat that dragged anchors pose to submarine cables, which are critical for global communications and energy networks.

It is not clear what has caused the new disruption.  
Large parts of West Africa are struggling to get back online following damage to an undersea cable.  
The fault has caused severe problems in Benin, Togo, Niger and Nigeria.  
The blackout is thought to have been caused by damage to the SAT-3 cable which runs from Portugal and Spain to South Africa, via West Africa.  
Around 70% of Nigeria's bandwidth was cut, causing severe problems for its banking sector, government and mobile phone networks.  
""SAT-3 is currently the only fibre optic cable serving West Africa,"" explained Ladi Okuneye, chief marketing officer of Suburban Telecom, which provides the majority of Nigeria's bandwidth.  
""So all West African countries have to use it.""  
Companies were being forced to use alternatives - such as using satellite links - to maintain connections to the rest of the world, he said.  
Telkom South Africa, one of the shareholders of SAT-3, has not said what caused the problems but said it was aware of ""a cable fault on the Benin branch that is being investigated"".  
The 15,000km (9,300mile) SAT-3 cable lands in eight West African countries as it winds its way between Europe and South Africa.  
""The rest of the system is unaffected by this fault,"" a Telkom South Africa representative said.  
Nigeria has been badly hit because around 70% of its bandwidth is routed through neighbouring Benin.  
The network, run by Suburban Telecom, was set up to bypass Nigeria's principal telecoms operator Nitel which runs the SAT-3 branch cable which lands in Nigeria.  
The SAT-3 consortium is in the process of sending a ship from Cape Town in South Africa to the area to investigate the fault.  
Mr Okuneye said that by the time the relevant paperwork was done, it was likely to be ""two weeks"" before the ship arrived off the coast.  
Meanwhile, Benin has been able to reroute its net traffic through neighbouring countries to get back online.  
Mr Okuneye said his company was hoping to do the same but said the process would be slower because its bandwidth requirements were so much larger than those of the small republic.

"Taiwan Detains Ship Linked to Undersea Cable Cutting Incident","Taiwanese authorities detain a Chinese-linked cargo vessel suspected of severing an international undersea cable, impacting internet connectivity.","https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/25/asia/taiwan-detains-ship-undersea-cable-intl-hnk/index.html","2025-02-26T12:00:00.000Z","",Yes,"Wayne Chang","New York, NY, United States","300000","2025-02-26","English","CNN","Taipei, Taiwan CNN —

Taiwan’s coast guard detained a cargo ship and its Chinese crew on Tuesday and said it was investigating whether the vessel had deliberately cut an undersea internet cable, in the latest possible breach of the island’s communication lines.

The vessel suspected of damaging the cable connecting Taiwan to its outlying Penghu Islands carried a “flag of convenience” and was crewed by eight Chinese nationals, Taiwan’s coast guard said in a statement.

A “flag of convenience” vessel is one that flies the flag of a country other than the country of ownership.

The ship “Hong Tai,” registered in the West African nation of Togo with Chinese funding, had been lingering near the cable in waters off the southwestern coast of Taiwan since Saturday evening and did not respond to multiple broadcasts from Taiwan’s coast guard, the statement added.

Shortly after the ship dropped anchor in the early hours of Tuesday, Taiwan’s telecom company Chunghwa Telecom detected that the cable had been disconnected.

The coast guard said it intercepted and boarded the vessel, before escorting it back to a port in the city of Tainan for investigation.

Taiwanese authorities said they could not rule out the possibility of a Chinese “gray zone operation,” a coercive or subversive act that falls below the threshold of war.

“Whether it was an intentional act of sabotage or purely an accident needs to be further probed,” the coast guard said in the statement, adding that the matter is now under investigations by prosecutors “in accordance with national security-level guidance.”

In recent years, multiple undersea telecoms cables around Taiwan have suffered suspicious damage.

In January, Taiwanese authorities said a Chinese-linked cargo vessel could have cut an international undersea cable off the island’s northern coast.

In 2023, Taiwan officials blamed Chinese ships for two incidents in which cables connecting Taiwan’s main island to its outlying islands of Matsu were damaged, causing an internet blackout. They stopped short of saying the acts were deliberate.

The incidents have raised concerns among Taiwan authorities of “gray zone” activities that could hamper the island’s internet and communications with the outside world.

Those concerns come as Taiwan has faced increasing intimidation from Beijing, which claims the self-ruled democracy as its own territory and has vowed to take control of it, by force if necessary.

They also follow a string of incidents in recent years of damage to undersea infrastructure worldwide, including communications cables. Two high-profile incidents in the Baltic Sea involved Chinese ships and remain under investigation.

According to NATO chief Mark Rutte, more than 95% of internet traffic globally is carried via undersea cables, with some 1.3 million kilometers of such cabling securing an estimated $10 trillion dollars of international trade daily.","The article discusses a significant incident involving a Chinese-linked cargo ship that is suspected of intentionally cutting an undersea internet cable off the coast of Taiwan.

It details the detention of the ship, the investigation by Taiwanese authorities, and the implications for internet connectivity.

This is the fifth time that the infamous AAG has been disconnected this year.

Internet connections along a major undersea cable system linking Vietnam with the rest of the world were disrupted on Tuesday, according to a local internet service provider (ISP).

The hiccup, which occurred at the section connecting Ho Chi Minh City with the main cable system, is likely to slow down internet speed in Vietnam.

The cause of the problem has yet to be identified, and no repair schedule has been announced.

Vietnam's ISPs said they have switched to their backup plans to ensure stable internet connections for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit.

This is the fifth time the AAG has been ruptured this year, following incidents in January, February, August and October. Repair works to the infamous cable system's problem in October were finished just over two weeks ago.

Connected in November 2009, the $560-million AAG with a capacity of 2 terabits per second handles more than 60 percent of the country’s international internet traffic.

With a length of over 20,000 kilometers (12,420 miles), the cable connects Southeast Asia and the U.S., passing through Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Brunei, Hong Kong and the Philippines.

Vietnam currently has six submarine cable systems, as well as a 120 gigabit channel that runs overland through China.

With a download speed of 5.46 megabytes per second, Vietnam's internet speed was ranked 74th out of 189 countries and territories in a global survey of broadband speeds compiled by Cable.co.uk, a U.K. broadband, TV, phone and mobile provider, in August.

Vietnam's average broadband speed was 10 times lower than its Southeast Asian neighbor Singapore, according to the survey. However, the country still managed to trump six other countries in the region.

An ageing submarine cable that links Australia to Southeast Asia was cut for the third time this year, underscoring the urgent need for a more robust connection to support the region’s growing internet traffic.

According to reports, the nearly 20-year-old SEA-ME-WE3 subsea cable that connects up Perth in Western Australia to Singapore and onwards to other landing points in Europe, the Middle East and Asia was cut in the early hours of 3 December 2017.

The cable fault occurred approximately 1,126 km from the cable landing station in Singapore. Until the link is restored, internet users in Australia can expect to see increased latency to Asian destinations.

The latest damage follows a series of cuts – typically caused by ship anchors, storms and earthquakes in the region – to the same cable in recent years, including an outage in August 2017 when its insulation near Hong Kong was damaged.

“These faults can be tricky to fix and, as a cable system ages, become more prominent,” said Luke Mackinnon, head of Australian network service provider Vocus International.

Vocus is in the midst of building the Australia Singapore Cable, a 4,600 km submarine cable system linking Perth to Singapore via Jakarta in Indonesia. Vocus is expected to lay the cable in early 2018 between Singapore and Christmas Island.

“Later this month, the components will be loaded on a ship and brought to Singapore. We expect it to arrive in January. At this point we will offload a third of the cable and repeaters at Singapore. The cable laying ship will pick them up in January and start laying in February,” Mackinnon said.

Apart from Vocus, a high-powered regional consortium comprising Google, Australian research network AARNet, telcos Indosat Ooredoo, Singtel and Telstra, and SubPartners is building the 9,000 km Indigo subsea cable that will link Singapore with Perth, and onwards to Sydney.

With landing stations in Singapore, Australia and Indonesia, Indigo – to be constructed by Alcatel Submarine Networks – will also allow connections between Singapore and Jakarta.

David Burns, Telstra’s group managing director of global services and international, said with internet data consumption growing by 70% in Asia in 2016, investments such as Indigo are critical for meeting the connectivity needs of consumers and businesses.

“This will be an important piece of technology infrastructure connecting Southeast Asia and Australia, and follows a number of recent network enhancements Telstra has undertaken to meet growing demand for data and better connectivity from our customers across the Asia-Pacific region,” he said.

Google executives said with a capacity of 18 terabits per second, Indigo will provide enough capacity for people in Singapore and Sydney to join eight million simultaneous high-definition Google Hangout video conference calls.","The article discusses the cutting of the SEA-ME-WE3 submarine cable, directly mentioning 'submarine cable' and 'cut'.

Transmitting about 99% of the world’s telecommunications, submarine cables have emerged as critical infrastructure necessary for systems to function. In recent months, there have been two “extraordinary” outages that have brought submarine cable damage and protection issues to the fore.  
Three cables in the Red Sea were severed by an anchor drag followed by the West African subsea cable outage where four cable systems were damaged by an undersea canyon avalanche incident. While these incidents led to widespread connectivity disruption, they also demonstrated the need for robust redundancy measures to manage outages.  
A key question that arises out of these incidents of submarine cable damage is whether cable owners have legal recourse to claim losses, including consequential losses. In this article, we attempt to unpack some knotty legal issues regarding submarine cable damage claims and remedies.  

**Protection of Submarine Cables**  
The first submarine cable laid across the English Channel between Dover and Calais in 1850 was reportedly put out of action almost immediately by a fisherman who hooked the line near shore and cut out a section as a souvenir. Over the past 175 years, as telecommunications technology has advanced, the number of subsea cable systems has surged, accompanied by an increase in damage risks.  
The causes of submarine cable damage include natural hazards, as in the case of the West African subsea landslide, as well as man-made activities ranging from fishing, undersea mining, oil and gas activities, and dredging – the cause of the outage in the Red Sea. Increasingly, deliberate actions by state and non-state actors also pose a threat to cable systems; early reporting around the Red Sea outage incorrectly posited that violent activity from the Houthi rebel group could have damaged the cables in question.  
Given the critical nature of submarine cables, it is surprising that their protection under international law is limited and in parts antiquated. There are two key treaties protecting submarine cables:  
* The 1884 Convention for the Protection of Submarine Telegraph Cables (“**Paris Convention**”) criminalizes “breaking or injuring a submarine cable, wilfully or by culpable negligence, in such manner as might interrupt or obstruct telegraphic communication, either wholly or partially, such punishment being without prejudice to any civil action for damages.” However, many state parties have failed to translate the Paris Convention’s requirements into their criminal law.  
* _or injury caused by persons who acted merely with the legitimate object of saving their lives or their ships, after having taken all necessary precautions to avoid such break or injury._  
While both the Paris Convention and the UNCLOS require States to criminalize conduct of private parties leading to submarine cable damage, there is no express prohibition in international law preventing States from deliberately damaging submarine cables - such as for undersea warfare. The need to address this is urgent; early reporting that the Houthi rebels were responsible for the Red Sea cable outage proved inaccurate, but an era of subsea warfare is upon us. Naval News notes that Russia has invested heavily in offensive seabed warfare capabilities, and that Hamas has built UUVs (uncrewed underwater vehicles) to target Israeli offshore natural gas infrastructure – the threat is real.  

**Potential Claims and Remedies by Cable Owners**  
If damage is incurred by submarine cables, their owners can be entitled to various claims or remedies depending on several factors. These include where the damage occurs, as this varies depending on if the cable is located in the high seas, an exclusive economic zone, a continental shelf, or territorial waters. Whether the damage was caused by a natural event or human activity is of course another factor, as well as the intent behind the damage – whether it was deliberate or negligent.  
The law is clearer if the damage occurs within territorial waters (within 12 nautical miles from the coast) – in such instances, national courts can exercise ordinary admiralty jurisdiction. However, damage that occurs in the high seas or a continental shelf can be subject to different legislation depending on national laws – state courts may not have jurisdiction in such instances.  
If damage is caused by human activity, cable owners can potentially seek damages from the wrongdoer but must consider general principles of damage in tort (criminal wrongdoing) law – for example, to recover any damages, the damage itself must be reasonably foreseeable – and limitations of liability under maritime law.  
Any liability claim would ultimately depend on the circumstances. For example, if a wrongdoer caused damage after noticing the position of a cable – and if the damage caused monetary losses for repairs or similar – then they would be in breach of a duty of care to the cable provider. A good illustration of such a claim would be the Canadian case of _The Realice_ where the vessel’s captain snagged a fibreoptic cable in his anchors. Believing – based on having glimpsed a map of active cables years before – that the cable was inactive, he cut it and was found liable for USD 1 million in damages.  

**Potential Claims Against Cable Owners**  
Given the role that subsea cables play in global connectivity, there are many players in the value chain who will be affected by any cable damage. For instance, an internet service provider might seek to recoup damages for internet outage arising from a damaged cable. To ensure that cable owners are protected by such claims, it is important to review contracts with third parties to ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place to manage liability.  
Limitation of liability provisions are standard in contracts between mobile service providers and customers. In contracts between cable owners and users of cable services, it is important to specify the forum to resolve disputes and the law applicable to the dispute. In instances of naturally occurring damage as in the case of the East African subsea landslide, there should be workable force majeure provisions that exclude liability of the cable owners.  

**Managing Liability: The Way Forward**  
Telecommunications companies might consider investing in monitoring equipment for submarine cables and to ensuring the development of backup and redundant cable systems. Another key exercise for private players is to review their contracts and ensure that they have robust protections in case of cable failure (for instance, carving out consequential losses and including workable force majeure clauses in contracts). Finally, cable systems owners and operators must ensure forensic data collection in instances of cable damage in support of any claims.  
In the international sphere, states need to come together to formulate a clear and comprehensive international legal framework for the protection of submarine cables. The 1884 Paris Convention and 1982 UNCLOS are unfit for purpose to address the protection of submarine cables in the 21st century.

SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service is looking to officially launch in Yemen, a country in the Middle East embroiled in a decade-long, ongoing civil war. The Starlink deal there is in its final stages, according to an unnamed senior Yemeni government official, Bloomberg reports.  

Yemen's Starlink licensing deal could take another month to complete, according to the report, but it's unclear when exactly the country would gain official access to Starlink's services. Yemen's current internet access is ranked among the slowest in the world, according to Ookla SpeedTest data, beating only East Timor and Cuba in terms of median mobile internet download speed. Its average broadband speed is very slow as well, with a median download speed of 7.39 Mbps. It's also a country where internet content is censored.  

The Houthi rebel group in Yemen has been accused of dismantling and disrupting telecommunications infrastructure in the country and the adjacent Red Sea. Cut sea cables disrupted 25% of all internet traffic in the broader region back in March (Houthi groups have denied claims that they were responsible). Starlink's satellites themselves would be substantially harder for any group to dismantle, but it would be possible for a group to swipe or destroy the physical Starlink dishes or routers, however. British human rights group Article 19 and numerous other nonprofits have dubbed the ongoing internet and telecom infrastructure attacks in Yemen part of an ongoing ""cyber war"" in the country.  

SpaceX has launched over 6,300 Starlink satellites into space. Roughly 5,900 are still in orbit, but Starlink isn't legally available to everyone. That hasn't stopped groups from getting access through black-market means, though. Countries and military groups without official licensing agreements, like paramilitary groups in Sudan and Russian forces invading Ukraine, have been able to get ahold of Starlink dishes from unauthorized third-party sellers and register their accounts through proxies. A Yemeni government official previously told Bloomberg that Starlink is already being widely used in the country despite not yet being licensed to operate there.  

Few countries in the Middle East officially have Starlink access at time of writing, meaning a Yemen deal would be among the first for Starlink in the region. Israel and Gaza reportedly got Starlink approval earlier this year, along with Jordan. Turkey, Oman, and Qatar are expected to get official Starlink access this year, according to Starlink's data. Nearby countries like Georgia have access, and other countries like Pakistan are still awaiting regulatory approval. Turkmenistan is also expected to gain Starlink access this year.","The article discusses the Starlink deal in Yemen and includes a direct mention of 'cut sea cables', stating that they disrupted 25% of all internet traffic in the region.

In the three months between November and January, three incidents of damage to Baltic Sea underwater cables have taken place, severing at least partly seven different telecommunication links that connect Baltic states like Sweden, Finland, Germany, Estonia, and Latvia. Statista has counted damage to 10 different Baltic underwater cables and three gas pipes, starting with the highly publicized rupture of the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines back in 2022.

A report by The Washington Post citing anonymous officials said on January 19 that intelligence and other evidence pointed to negligence rather than malice in the case of the three incidents that took place in 2023 and 2024. Suspected in these are two Chinese-registered ships reportedly with Russian links and one vessel believed to be part of Russia's so-called shadow fleet dodging sanctions by transporting oil above sanctioned price caps. Since then, however, an additional incident took place, stoking suspicion of sabotage once more. Another Russian-crewed cargo liner was detained and searched by Norwegian authorities on January 31 near Tromso at the request of Latvia after the incident that took place five days earlier but was cleared later. Sweden meanwhile detained another ship, the Bulgarian-operated Vezhen, and determined it had damaged the cable, if accidentally.

Doubts about the events being a coincidence are persistent, mostly due to the 2022 Nord Stream incidents that have almost certainly been deemed sabotage. The damage done on September 26, 2022, was dramatic when detonations ruptured the two gas pipelines connecting Russia and Germany amid Europe finding it near impossible to wean itself off Russian fossil fuel. However, Russia has not been zeroed in as the only likely perpetrator in the case, with some theories now also pointing to Ukraine.

Considering this background, it’s not a surprise that Norway's search of the Silver Dania wasn’t the only one in the context of ruptured Baltic undersea cables. Denmark intercepted and boarded the Chinese Yi Peng 3, suspected to have caused cable damage in November, while Finland seized the Eagle S that it identified as having caused cable and pipeline damage this past Christmas Day. It did not help suspicion that the last remaining ship implied in the damages, the Chinese Newnew Polar Bear, carried on into Russian waters after the incident that took place in 2023 and was escorted by a Russian state-owned ice breaker.

The way in which commercial vessels have been damaging pipelines and cables is different from the initial Nord Stream ruptures, where traces of explosives were found. The ships have been slicing the cables and pipes by dragging their anchors - often for extended periods of time. While this has led some experts to believe that the vessels in question are poorly maintained and have poorly trained crews, others have said that they find it unlikely that the crews would not notice such an issue. While damage by anchors is not as extensive as by explosives, it is still costly and can disrupt communications, electricity and gas supply significantly until repairs can be carried out.

With uncertainty about accident or attack persisting in Europe, other cable cutting incidents have likewise raised suspicion, for example in Taiwan earlier this month. A governing body estimates that around 150 to 200 underwater cable damage incidents happen per year around the world mostly from anchoring and fishing - which equates to around three cable repairs per week. While this makes the recent cluster of Baltic Sea cable incidents not impossible but still unlikely to occur, suspicion will continue amid ongoing tensions with China and Russia as well as the history of almost definite sabotage incidents in Baltic waters.","The article discusses multiple incidents of damage to underwater cables in the Baltic Sea, specifically mentioning that three incidents occurred in a short period, severing telecommunication links.

According to reports, the internet blackout, which has left 75 million people with only limited access, was caused by a ship that tried to moor off the coast of Egypt in bad weather on Wednesday. Since then phone and internet traffic has been severely reduced across a huge swath of the region, slashed by as much as 70% in countries including India, Egypt, and Dubai.

""It will depend on how bad the damage is, but they'll find the sections in question and bring them up onto a ship for repair before sinking them again,"" said Mauldin. ""It could take a week or possibly two weeks.""

The fibre optic wires in question - called Flag Europe-Asia and Sea-Me-We 4 - are some of the most vital information pipelines between Europe and the east. The latter, which runs in an uninterrupted line from western Europe to Singapore, had only recently been opened after a mammoth £500m, three-year installation project. Between them, the two lines are responsible for around 75% of all connectivity in the Middle East and South Asia.

""The problems are really at pinch points where increasingly huge amounts of information are coming through,"" said Jim Kinsella, chairman of Interoute, Europe's largest fibre optic network provider. He said that improvements are scheduled for submarine cabling, but that plans to send more internet traffic over land connections rather than under the sea had been set back by political wrangling.

By Aaron Tan, Computer Weekly

December 4, 2017

The aging SEA-ME-WE 3 submarine cable that links Australia to Southeast Asia was cut for the third time this year, underscoring the urgent need for a more robust connection to support the region’s growing internet traffic.

According to reports, the nearly two-decade old SEA-ME-WE3 subsea cable that connects up Perth in Western Australia to Singapore and onwards to other landing points in Europe, the Middle East and Asia was cut in the wee hours of 3 December 2017.

The cable fault occurred approximately 1,126 km from the cable landing station in Singapore. Until the link is restored, internet users in Australia can expect to see increased latency to Asian destinations.

The latest damage follows a series of cuts – typically caused by ship anchors, storms and earthquakes in the region – to the same cable in recent years, including an outage in August 2017 when its insulation near Hong Kong was damaged.

“These faults can be tricky to fix, and as a cable system ages, become more prominent,” said Luke Mackinnon, head of Australian network service provider Vocus International.

Vocus is in the midst of building the Australia Singapore Cable, a 4,600 km submarine cable system linking Perth to Singapore via Jakarta in Indonesia. Vocus is expected to lay the cable in early 2018 between Singapore and Christmas Island.

“Later this month, the components will be loaded on a ship and brought to Singapore. We expect it to arrive in January. At this point we will offload a third of the cable and repeaters at Singapore. The cable laying ship will pick them up in January and start laying in February,” Mackinnon said.

We can’t count on the stars aligning every time a cable or pipeline suffers mysterious damage, and must find ways of incentivizing ship crews to obey maritime rules.

The country’s authorities stepped up their already active surveillance in the Gulf of Finland.

January 23, 2025 4:00 am CET  
_Elisabeth Braw is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council._

On Christmas Day last year, Finland received a special kind of gift. Four undersea cables were damaged in the country’s waters within the course of a few hours, but Finland was already alert and watching, having decided such tricks were rather likely. And it was able to catch the perpetrator in _flagrante delicto_.

But we can’t count on the stars aligning every time a cable or pipeline suffers mysterious damage. This is why the U.K.-led Joint Expeditionary Force’s (JEF) plan to monitor the Baltic Sea’s undersea installations is a good next step. But we must also find creative ways of incentivizing ship crews to obey the rules of our waters.

We should hand it to the Finns. When this type of damage to the Baltic Sea’s cables and pipelines became a reliable trend last autumn, the country’s authorities stepped up their already active surveillance in the Gulf of Finland. Granted, it’s a small body of water, with similarly small shipping lanes, but Finland made sure no movement went unseen. And lo and behold, on Dec. 25, the Cook Islands-flagged Eagle S tanker crisscrossed the gulf, damaging not one but four undersea cables.

We know all this because Finnish authorities were actively observing. Better yet, the tanker was only slightly outside Finnish territorial waters, and authorities managed to coax the captain into sailing back into territorial waters. Had the ship remained in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), very little could have been done.

There’s no two ways about it, the Finns got lucky — though as the saying goes, “the harder I practice, the luckier I get.” Had Finland not maintained such close surveillance or practiced what actions to take if a vessel dragged its anchor, the Eagle S could have easily gotten away with it.

We can’t assume this will be the case every time a ship damages our undersea infrastructure with apparent intent. We can’t assume our navies and coast guards will be able to catch the perpetrators in the act, and we can’t be sure it will all occur in our territorial waters — vessels wishing to cause such harm deliberately do so in EEZs. And no, we can’t assume we’ll be able to coax the ship into territorial waters as the Finns did.

This makes the new Nordic Warden initiative a crucial development. Announced on Jan. 6 by the JET — a military grouping comprising the U.K., the Netherlands and the Nordic and Baltic nations — it “harnesses AI to assess data from a range of sources, including the Automatic Identification System (AIS) ships use to broadcast their position, to calculate the risk posed by each vessel entering areas of interest.”

The action also reinforces existing and planned NATO responses: “Specific vessels identified as being part of Russia’s shadow fleet have been registered into the system so they can be closely monitored when approaching areas of interest. If a potential risk is assessed, the system will monitor the suspicious vessel in real time and immediately send out a warning, which will be shared with JEF participant nations, as well as NATO Allies.”

This is a pioneering effort to keep the Baltic Sea’s pipelines and cables safe. Although it seems entirely sensible for nations to collectively gather data suggesting interference with undersea installations, until recently, there was simply no reason to conduct such monitoring.

The last two-or-so years have radically changed this notion. Indeed, just a few days after Nordic Warden was announced, NATO introduced Baltic Sentry — an initiative that will see alliance frigates and maritime aircraft patrol the Baltic Sea, aided by naval drones and other technology.

On Dec. 25, the Cook Islands-flagged Eagle S tanker crisscrossed the gulf, damaging not one but four undersea cables.

No one can accuse NATO’s Baltic Sea members of not responding to nefarious undersea activities. And these countries are now hoping that the uptick in monitoring and patrolling will convince prospective saboteurs that harming Baltic Sea cables and pipelines isn’t worth it. In particular, they’re hoping to convince the captains of shadow vessels — many of whom come from developing nations — that conducting sabotage on behalf of Russia would be a bad idea.

The Eagle S crew, which is now being investigated by Finnish authorities, are precisely such a group. We don’t know yet what caused the Eagle S to drag its anchor for such a long time in waters that contain clearly marked undersea cables, and we may never learn the full story. What’s clear, though, is that in the past 18 months, the Baltic Sea has seen three major cases of damage to undersea installations.

But not all the ships that have damaged the Baltic Sea’s undersea installations were shadow vessels. On the contrary, the suspects in the October 2023 and November 2024 cable cuts were legally sailing ships owned by Chinese companies — one flagged in Hong Kong and one in China — and crewed by Chinese citizens. Boarding, let alone detaining, such ships would be quite different than acting against a ship flagged in the Cook Islands.

Indeed, if Finnish authorities were to board a Chinese-flagged ship in the Finnish EEZ, China would likely retaliate. At the very least, Beijing or Moscow (or both) would argue that shipping in the Baltic Sea now requires an escort by the People’s Liberation Army Navy, the Russian Navy or both. A recent report by the Danish Intelligence Service warned of precisely this scenario.

That’s why NATO and the JEF are betting that their forceful signaling will be enough — though odds are it won’t.

Still, even Chinese and Russian shipmasters and crews love their freedom. To be sure, if autocratic authorities tell a shipmaster to cut undersea cables, they may feel they have no choice. But countries in the Baltic Sea and elsewhere could communicate to them that it would be a bad idea to damage cables — and that they may even be rewarded if they abide by maritime rules.

This is the type of creative thinking we need in order to figure out how governments can best incentivize good maritime behavior, and we should all pitch in with ideas. I’ll start: What if we considered political asylum for shipmasters and crews of NATO-identified suspect vessels who comply with instructions not to harm infrastructure? Feel free to send me your suggestions.","The article titled ""Let's get creative to protect undersea cables from sabotage"" directly addresses the topic of undersea cables, specifically discussing incidents where cables were damaged, including a notable incident on December 25, 2024, involving the Eagle S tanker damaging four undersea cables.

Powerful earthquakes near Taiwan shut off international phone and Internet service for the Far East just after Christmas. Five repair ships have been working on the damaged undersea cables since late last week. How do you repair a cable that’s lying across the ocean floor?

Drag it to the surface. Earthquakes—like ships’ anchors and fishing trawls—can cause undersea fiber-optic cables to malfunction or break many miles below the surface of the water. When this happens, a telecom operator has to find the location of the accident, hoist up the damaged part, and replace it with a new stretch of cable.

First, the telecom operator has to locate the part of the cable that’s no longer working. Cable engineers can figure out the general neighborhood of the problem based on the reported phone or Internet service outages. From terminal stations on shore, they can zero in on more specific coordinates by sending light pulses along the fibers in the cable. A working fiber will transmit those pulses all the way across the ocean, but a broken one will bounce it back from the site of the damage. By measuring the time it takes for the reflections to come back, the engineers can figure out where along the cable they have a problem.

Once they know that, the company can send out a large cable ship with a few miles of fresh fiber-optic lines on board to make the repairs. If the faulty part of the cable is less than about 6,500 feet down, the crew will send out a submersible tanklike robot that can move around on the sea floor. A signal can be sent through the cable to guide the robot toward the problem spot. When the robot finds the right place, it grabs ahold of the cable, cuts out the nonworking section, and pulls the loose ends back up to the ship.

The robot doesn’t work in very deep water (with very high pressure). In those situations, the technicians aboard the cable ship use a grapnel, or a hook on a very long wire, to snatch up the cable from the sea floor. The grapnel uses a mechanical cutting and gripping device that can split the cable on both sides of the break and drag the loose ends to the surface. One end is hooked onto a buoy so it won’t sink, and the other is hauled on board.

The malfunctioning cable section can be fixed on board the ship. A skilled technician or “jointer” splices the glass fibers and uses powerful adhesives to attach the new section of cable to each cut end of the original—a process that can take up to 16 hours. The repaired cable is then lowered back to the seabed on ropes.","The article 'How Do You Fix an Undersea Cable?' discusses the repair processes for undersea cables, particularly in the context of damage caused by earthquakes.

4 out of 5 undersea cables connecting to Vietnam to the world have been damaged due to reasons unknown as yet, which seriously impact connection speed and reliability.

On January 30, an Internet service provider (ISP) confirmed that the Inter Asia (Intra Asia – IA) cable had problems since January 28, which was determined to be a cable break at about 130 km from Singapore, causing all international connection capacity from Vietnam to Singapore via IA.

Previously, the problems with AAE, AAG, and APG undersea cable systems, which happened since 2022 and early 2023, have not been fully addressed yet, making it harder for internet providers to ensure the quality of the connections to their consumers.

Vietnam has six submarine cables and an overland system that runs through China namely SMW3, AAG, IA, APG, AAE-1, SJC2, ADC. However, of these, SJC2 and ADC have not been officially put into operation yet. The only line still operating is SMW3, which is an old cable line and is about to be liquidated.

There are 69 million Internet users in the country of 96 million people, according to German data portal Statista.

There are three cable landing sites in Vietnam, and six in-service submarine cable systems connecting Vietnam; two new cables including SJC2 and ADC are under construction.

**Cable Landing Stations in Vietnam**

VNPT and Viettel are the dominant international submarine cable operators in Vietnam. Viettel has invested in AAG, TGN-IA, APG, AAE-1, and ADC, and hosts the cable landing station in Vietnam for AAE-1 with its US$50 million investment in the AAE-1 cable project.

Sluggish Internet connectivity caused by problems with cross-sea cable systems has become a regular annoyance in Vietnam, and users are running out of patience.

At 7:20 am on Thursday, the Asia America Gateway (AAG) cable network suffered a problem at its landing point in Hong Kong, signaling another period of slow connection speeds for Internet users in Vietnam.

The 20,000-kilometer system provides one of Vietnam’s lifeline Internet gateways to the world by linking it with other Southeast Asian countries and with the U.S. across the Pacific Ocean.

Thursday’s problem was by no means the first experienced by the AAG, which has one of the largest capacities out of those that Vietnam is connected to.

Since its launch in 2009, the AAG has experienced repeated problems, with two ruptures in 2014 and four cable cuts in 2015.

Vietnam’s Internet was also impeded between March 3 and 18 last year because of a power leak, according to local tech news website ICTNews.

As many as four separate problems have been reported with the AAG so far in 2017.

AAG and other submarine cable systems, including the Asia Pacific Gateway (APG), Intra Asia (IA) and South-East Asia - Middle East - Western Europe 3 (SMW-3) cables, are responsible for 90 percent of Vietnam’s international connections.

The APG system, which had been expected to be a reliable alternative to the AAG when it was put into use late last year, turned out to be a disappointment after a rupture was reported in June along a section connecting the central city of Da Nang with the U.S., Japan and Hong Kong.

In a rare incident in August, all three submarine communications cables crucial to Vietnam’s international connectivity – IA, SMW-3 and AAG – came down with problems simultaneously, causing global connection from Vietnam to be slowed for over a month.

**The root of the problem**

According to Nguyen Manh Hung, chairman of Vietnam National Posts and Telecommunications Group (VNPT), recent problems with Internet cables are not to be blamed on faulty designs but rather on their locations.

As most of these cables make their landing points in Hong Kong or Singapore, they can be subject to constant disturbance caused by large vessels that frequent the busy ports, leading to ruptures, Hung explained.

Other possible explanations for repeated issues include anchors dropped by ships out at sea and natural geological fractures, he added.

“As for the AAG system, the developer must take some responsibility for not having conducted careful enough surveys of the network map to allow such problems to recur so frequently,” one leader of an Internet provider in Vietnam said on condition of anonymity.

**HUYNH THANH PHI (marketing expert):**
I find it unacceptable that Internet providers simply announce a “cable cut” and tell their customers to wait for it to get fixed without taking further responsibility.

“Cable cut” has too often been used as force majeure that exempts providers from responsibility for intolerably sluggish connection speeds. As a user, I doubt this line of reasoning is still valid with the growing number of such incidents.

Internet carriers in Vietnam need to demonstrate more clearly their duty as a service provider, rather than act simply as a messenger to make announcements of “force majeure”!","The article discusses various issues related to undersea cables, particularly the Asia America Gateway (AAG) system.

It mentions specific incidents of cable cuts, including 'two ruptures in 2014 and four cable cuts in 2015', and describes the effects of these disruptions on Internet connectivity in Vietnam.

A submarine cable in the Middle East has been snapped, adding to global net problems caused by breaks in two lines under the Mediterranean on Wednesday.

The Falcon cable, owned by a firm which operates another damaged cable, led to a ""critical"" telecom breakdown, according to one local official.

The cause of the latest break has not been confirmed but a repair ship has been deployed, said owner Flag Telecom.

The earlier break disrupted service in Egypt, the Middle East and India.

""The situation is critical for us in terms of congestion,"" Omar Sultan, chief executive of Dubai's ISP DU, told The Associated Press, following the most recent break.

Wednesday's incident caused disruption to 70% of the nationwide internet network in Egypt on Wednesday, while India suffered up to 60% disruption.

Flag Telecom said a repair ship was expected to arrive at the site of the first break - 8.3km from Alexandria in Egypt - on 5 February, with repair work expected to take a week.

A repair ship deployed to the second break - 56km from Dubai - was expected to arrive at the site in the ""next few days"", the firm said.

The first cable - the Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe (FLAG) - was cut at 0800 on 30 January, the firm said.

A second cable thought to lie alongside it - SEA-ME-WE 4, or the South East Asia-Middle East-West Europe 4 cable - was also split.

FLAG is a 28,000km (17,400 mile) long submarine communications cable that links Australia and Japan with Europe via India and the Middle East.

SEA-ME-WE 4 is a submarine cable linking South East Asia to Europe via the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East.

The two cable cuts meant that the only cable in service connecting Europe to the Middle East via Egypt was the older Sea-M-We 3 system, according to research firm TeleGeography.

The firm said the cuts reduced the amount of available capacity on the stretch of network between India and Europe by 75% percent.

As a result, carriers in Egypt and the Middle East re-routed their European traffic around the globe, through South East Asia and across the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

The cause of the break has still not been confirmed. Initial reports suggested that it could have been snapped by a ship's anchor.

But Egypt's communications ministry said damage to the cables in the Mediterranean was not caused by ships.

The transport ministry said that footage recorded by onshore video cameras of the location of the cables showed no maritime traffic in the area when the cables were damaged.

""The ministry's maritime transport committee reviewed footage covering the period of 12 hours before and 12 hours after the cables were cut and no ships sailed the area,"" a statement said.

Internet service providers said they expected India's to be back to about 80% of its usual speed by the end of Friday.

In Egypt Minister of Communications and Information Technology Tarek Kamil said he expected to be at the same capacity within two days.

""However, it's not before ten days until the internet service returns to its normal performance,"" Kamil told the state Al-Ahram newspaper.","The article discusses the impact of cuts to submarine cables, specifically the Falcon and SEA-ME-WE 4 cables, which caused significant disruptions to internet services in Egypt and India.

Submarine cables are very reliable, however, there are occasions when a repair to a cable becomes necessary.

Cable faults are caused by many events, both man-made and natural. In water depths greater than 1,000 metres faults are almost always caused by natural events such as underwater seismic activity, underwater landslides, current abrasion etc. In water depths less than 200 metres, faults are nearly always caused by man-made activities such as fishing and anchoring.

Around 70% of all cable faults are caused by fishing and anchoring activities and about 12% are caused by natural hazards, e.g. current abrasion or earthquakes.

When it becomes necessary to repair a cable, a cableship needs to be mobilised. Cableships are placed at strategic locations worldwide and are on 24 hour standby to carry out any repairs.

Cable systems are monitored constantly so when a system becomes faulty, it is known immediately. The staff in the cable stations at each end of the cable system then commences a series of tests to locate the fault. Once the fault location is known, this location is passed onto the cableship so it can make final plans for the repair.

The cableship will load the necessary spare cable and subsea plant required to carry out the repair. It will then sail to the fault location.

Once the cableship reaches the repair site, it will commence operations to recover the cable. The ship grapples for the cable using a large cutting grapnel (a hook), towing it along the seabed until it catches the cable. The cable is then raised off the seabed and cut. In buried sections of cable, an ROV might also be used to locate the cable and cut it on the seabed.

Once the cable is cut, the grapnel is recovered to the cableship and replaced with a holding grapnel. This grapnel is then lowered to the seabed on a rope and towed along the seabed until one end of the cut cable is engaged/caught. The cable is then raised to the surface and recovered on board the cableship. The cable is then tested and any damaged sections removed. The cable is sealed to protect it from seawater ingress and lowered back to the seabed and buoyed off.

This recovery process is then repeated for the other cable end. Once all damaged cable has been removed and the original fault identified and cut out, the cable is jointed to a section of spare cable on board, sufficient in length to replace the damaged section which has been cut out. This cable is then paid out back to the cable which had been previously buoyed off. The buoy and other cable end is recovered back to the cableship and following tests to ensure there are no further faults, the two ends are then jointed together. This is called the final splice. The final splice is then lowered back to the seabed and final tests made to ensure the cable is working correctly. Where the repair has been made in a buried section of cable, the cable is reburied by means of an ROV, water jetting the cable back into the seabed to a target burial depth equivalent to that when the cable was originally laid. A repair operation may take many days to complete.

The final splice represents a further hazard to fishing gear since the final splice is essentially a bight of wire leading from the seabed to the ship. This is held onboard by rope stoppers, then the procedure is simply to slip both stoppers and lower the bight of cable back onto the seabed. Cable burial of this section is often not completely successful due to the sharp turns in the cable and poor visibility conditions and therefore avoidance of final splices is highly recommended.

Final Splice Bights are laid on the seabed at right angles to cable line. The crown of the bight may be up to 2 x water depth from chartered cable line.","The article discusses maintenance and repair operations for submarine cables, specifically addressing the process of cutting cables when necessary.

It includes phrases such as 'the cable is then raised off the seabed and cut', 'once the cable is cut', and 'the original fault identified and cut out', indicating that the topic of cut sea cables is a central theme rather than a minor mention.

Additionally, it explains the causes of cable faults, which are often related to human activities that lead to cable cutting.

"Asia America Gateway Undersea Cable Cut","Details on internet connectivity disruptions for Vietnam and others due to the Asia America Gateway cable cut, exacerbated by tropical storms.","https://www.bcsatellite.net/blog/another-asia-america-gateway-undersea-cable-cut","","",Yes,"Patrick Gannon","London, EC4M 8AB, United Kingdom","10000","2022-04-15","English","BusinessCom Networks","In late August, the Asia America Gateway, comprised of three internet cable systems connecting Vietnam to the internet backbone were cut. It seems that two tropical storms in the region are being held responsible for the failures. According to “The Star” in Malaysia, two typhoons in late August, Hato, leaving three dead in its wake, and Pakhar, which also ravaged the region a few days later, contributed to the failures.

Four cables were damaged: Asia America Gateway (AAG), TGN-Intra Asia (TGN-IA), SEA-ME-WE3 (SMW3), and Asia Submarine-Cable Express (ASE). The AAG apparently ruptured in three places, all within 90 km of the Hong Kong station. The SMW3 cable connects Singapore to Perth, Australia, ASE connects Asian landings to California, and TGA-IA as well as ASE provide additional intra-Asia connections.

After suffering bandwidth losses on all systems, one, SMW3, which was put into service in 1999, was quickly restored. Meanwhile Vietnam’s ISPS, having prepared backup plans for such outages, rerouted international connections via land-based cables through neighboring countries such as Laos, Thailand and China. Branches of the AAG in Japan, Singapore and the US were put to work to handle the rerouted traffic.

The AAG is somewhat infamous, having already ruptured twice this year. In each case, repair work took about one month for each break. Similarly, the IA cable ruptured three times earlier this year. With about 60 percent of the country’s 92 million residents online, the country faces some real challenges keeping its citizens and businesses online.

### Domino Effect Across the Region

Vietnam was not the only country affected, with two of Australian ISPs being impacted, as well as routes connecting Hong Kong to the USA, Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines. At the time, the cable owners were predicting repairs to last well into October. In the meantime, Australian ISPs servicing millions of customers, are routing Asian traffic through the United States, resulting in higher latency, due to long trips across the Pacific Ocean.

As of Sept 28, 2017, the link from Perth to Asia remains unavailable. Additional damage was discovered to the insulation of SMW3. The fault is known as a “shunt fault,” a name describing damage to a subsea cable’s insulation being damaged. While no root cause has been provided, shunt faults can be caused by ocean currents, such as those that might have been generated by the typhoons, or by ship anchors.

As for Vietnam, their outage which began on August 27, was finally repaired a month later on September 30, only to encounter trouble again on Oct 12 when the AAG lost the connection to Hong Kong. These undersea cables have become vital for connectivity to the internet backbone. The TGN-IA cable system began operation in November of 2009. It spans 5,800 km, and links Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, the Philippines, Vietnam and Guam with the ability to carry 3.84 Tbit/s of traffic. This critical network of underwater submarine cables connect Asia and the United States. Nearly as impressive, the AAG cable system runs very long distances – 20,000 kilometers – and also connects Southeast Asia with the US, supporting up to 2.88 Tbit/s of capacity.

These cable systems are frequently severed or damaged, resulting in lengthy repairs that impact residential and business clients in the affected countries. BusinessCom’s broadband satellite solutions can provide redundancy and backup for mission-critical business traffic. There are no backhoes, anchors or typhoons in space. Broadband satellite connectivity is very reliable, and backed by a BusinessCom SLA (service level agreement), whether used as a primary means of internet access, a load-shared service that takes over if the primary fails, or as redundant, stand by capacity.","The article 'Another Asia America Gateway Undersea Cable Cut' discusses the cutting of undersea cables, specifically the Asia America Gateway, and details the incidents caused by tropical storms.

Egypt said it has arrested three men suspected of slicing a crucial undersea Internet cable on Wednesday, causing widespread problems from Kenya to Pakistan.

Egypt published photos of three men in a boat with their hands tied along with scuba diving tanks. The men were apprehended just offshore where SEA-ME-WE 4 reaches land, according to a Facebook posting purportedly by Egypt's military.

SEA-ME-WE 4 is a major cable, said Doug Madory, senior research engineer for Renesys, a company that monitors global internet activity. The cable stopped carrying traffic at 6:20 UTC on Wednesday.

Undersea cables can break due to earthquakes or ship anchors. There are fewer than 10 ships worldwide that are equipped to repair underseas cables, but Egypt's might be easier to fix since it is closer to shore.

Internet outages have hit businesses and home use.

Internet services have been disrupted in large parts of the Middle East and India following damage to two undersea cables in the Mediterranean. There was disruption to 70% of the nationwide network in Egypt, and India suffered up to 60% disruption.

UK firms such as British Airways have told the BBC that call centres have been affected by the outage. Industry experts said it could take up to one week to repair the damaged cables and resume full service.

International telephone calls, which have also been affected, are being rerouted to work around the problem.

**'Degraded performance'**

Disruption also occurred in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, reported the Associated Press. In Dubai, at least two internet service providers (ISPs) were affected. An official at the provider, DU, told AP that a fault in a network between Alexandria, Egypt, and Palermo, Italy, was to blame.

A major internet routing outage struck UK telcos over the bank holiday weekend - knackering access to the World of Warcraft website, the BBC, Amazon, Facebook and other sites for more than 24 hours.  

It's understood that a submarine cable carrying web traffic snapped between Blighty and the Netherlands, causing headaches for ISPs. Some _Reg_ readers affected by the downtime had suspected that the culprit was undersea fibre optic cabling that had been mistakenly sliced.  

Rumours that some considered to be outlandish on O2's customer forum suggested that a submarine may have hit a line in the Atlantic, causing internet connection issues throughout Europe on Sunday.  

Meanwhile, officially, O2 told its customers:  
> Dear members, the recent routing issues causing unreachable destinations from our network are caused by a major fibre breakdown.  

A number of _Reg_ readers wondered if global internet connectivity outfit Level 3 had been responsible for the outage. However, the company confirmed to us that it too had been affected as a customer of networking biz Interoute, whose sub-sea cable was understood to be at fault.  

Level 3 said in a statement to us:  
> We do have some leased capacity from Interoute which was impacted by the cable cut. Upon notification of the failure on the Interoute Network, Level 3 took immediate action to re-route our customers onto our own network.  

UK telcos such as BSkyB and BT were apparently relatively swift at responding to the problem by routing their networks in order to keep disruption to a minimum.  

However, Telefonica - which owns O2 and Be - came under fire from its punters for what many considered to be a slow response in tackling the outage.  

One frustrated customer said on O2's [forum](http://community.o2.co.uk/t5/Home-Broadband-Home-Phone/Connection-difficulties/m-p/273606#M59420) just yesterday:  
> Almost 30 hours to get so much as any acknowledgement on any of the O2 status pages. A mind numbingly inept display by O2.  

While another [complained](http://community.o2.co.uk/t5/Home-Broadband-Home-Phone/Connection-difficulties/td-p/273606/page/10):  
> It's been 32 hrs since I went down, still no update from 02 or any sort of a time scale, according to net BT and Sky had this fixed hours ago.  

_El Reg_ has asked O2 and Interoute to comment on this story, but neither had responded at time of publication. We'll update the piece if O2 or Interoute do furnish us with statements.  

### Updated to add  
Interoute's chief technology officer Matthew Finnie has been in touch to confirm that on 27 August at 02.57am GMT, the undersea cable broke approximately 120km off the UK shore and 100km off the Netherlands shore.  

""A specialist cable marine crew and vessel have been engaged,"" he said. ""The timeline for a full system fix is currently pending. The cause of the fibre break has not yet been fully determined. However, current information suggests that the culprit was a ship's anchor.  

""Approximately 400Gbps of services have been successfully re-routed and handed back into active service since the break occurred. In the next 48 hours, Interoute aims to have 75 to 80 per cent of the total unprotected services back up and running.  

""None of Interoute's protected services, e.g. Internet, corporate connectivity, hosting or video have been affected. We apologise for any inconvenience caused by this cable break.","The article titled 'UK ISPs crippled by undersea cable snap' discusses a significant incident involving a snapped undersea cable that caused major internet connectivity issues for UK ISPs.

It states that a submarine cable carrying web traffic broke between the UK and the Netherlands, leading to outages affecting numerous websites and services for over 24 hours.

The article provides specific details about the incident, including responses from ISPs like O2 and Level 3, and mentions that the cause of the cable break was suspected to be a ship's anchor.

This aligns with the criterion of being an article on the topic of cut sea cables, as it includes direct mentions of 'undersea cable', discusses the implications of the cut, and treats the incident as a central theme rather than a minor mention."

**Published Date:** 02/27/2023  

Apparently the UK suffered a web blackout over the weekend, but it's news to me.  

The break happened to an Interoute cable running to Amsterdam, some 120km off the UK shore and 100km from the Netherlands. While I don't doubt the cable was severed - Interoute itself confirmed the cut -, I do wonder at reports of chaos caused as a result.  

That's because I suffered absolutely no outages over the weekend, or on Monday while working.  

According to _The Register_ - the only publication to report the outage - the reason I could continue working uninterrupted is that most ISPs re-routed their traffic, with mobile operator O2 suffering the most due to parent company Telefonica's reliance on that cable. Websites including the BBC, Facebook and Amazon were also reportedly affected for about 24 hours.  

Interoute apparently later told the news site the cable was likely severed by a ship's anchor. That got me curious - how many ships anchor 100km offshore and is it even possible? I couldn't find an answer to the former, but a quick search of sea depth confirmed the latter is definitely possible. The route roughly follows the area where the English Channel meets the North Sea, which includes ground that once linked the UK to mainland Europe and so is relatively shallow (around 40m versus 120m or so at the Channel's deepest points).  

Either way, the incident serves as a good example of how redundancy means disruption from cable breaks can go relatively unnoticed, even by those of us in the industry.","The article titled 'UK/Europe fiber cable cut' focuses on a specific incident involving the severing of an undersea cable, which is a direct mention of cut sea cables.

Published on 03/14/2024  

Internet connectivity in several African countries was disrupted today, March 14, 2024. Beginning at approximately 05:00 UTC, west and central African countries were most impacted, as was South Africa. Based on published reports and social media posts from impacted network providers, the disruption is believed to be due to multiple undersea cable failures in the region. From The Gambia to Côte d'Ivoire, including a major network in South Africa (Vodacom), a total of 13 African countries were impacted, based on our observations.

Cloudflare Radar data shows a pattern of disruptions from the north to the south of West Africa over time. It began south of Senegal, with The Gambia, Guinea, and Liberia experiencing disruptions around 05:00 UTC.

In The Gambia and Guinea, the disruptions lasted about 30 minutes, while in Liberia, the disruption has lasted more than 12 hours.

Moving south, around 07:30 UTC, disruptions were observed in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana.

Niger, a landlocked nation in Central Africa, experienced a disruption at 09:15, lasting just over two hours.

This was followed by disruptions starting around 10:30 UTC in Nigeria, Benin, Cameroon, and Togo. Namibia and Burkina Faso were also impacted. These disruptions were ongoing at the time of writing.

At approximately the same time, a significant disruption was observed on Vodacom’s South African network. Traffic began to recover after 13:30 UTC, and appears to have reached close to normal levels by 16:00 UTC.

### The importance of submarine cables

This series of disruptions serves as a reminder of how dependent the Internet is on submarine cables, which are estimated to carry over 90% of intercontinental data traffic. Only a small percentage of general use is done via satellite networks. There are 529 active submarine cables and 1,444 landings that are currently active or under construction, running to an estimated 1.3 million km around the globe.

Reports from several local networks, including South Africa’s Vodacom, MTN in Nigeria, and Celtiis in Bénin, reference multiple submarine cable failures. Microsoft was more detailed, stating on their Azure status page that “multiple fiber cables on the West Coast of Africa — WACS, MainOne, SAT3, ACE — have been impacted which reduced total capacity supporting our Regions in South Africa”. The company also explains that the recent cable cuts in the Red Sea in combination with today’s cable issues, “has impacted all Africa capacity”.

In addition to the impacts to the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, the website of MainOne, owners of the MainOne submarine cable, was offline for several hours. DNS for mainone.net is handled by name servers located in MainOne’s address space. It appears that a portion of the IPv4 address space for AS37282 (MAINONE) stopped being announced between 07:30 and 15:00 UTC, and once this address space was being routed again, both the nameservers and website became reachable.

The disruptions are now being reported by news media outlets, including in South Africa, where the emphasis is not only on the latest outage but also on the problem with the submarine cable operator Seacom. This operator experienced a service-impacting outage on its cable system in the Red Sea. On March 8, the company stated that it is waiting for permits to start repairing its broken submarine cable in the Red Sea.

**Author: Damico, Tony M**  
**Published Date: 06/18/2024**  

Multiple undersea internet cables were mysteriously severed and subsequently gained significant attention in the beginning of 2008. The attacks on those cables highlighted the enormous amount of internet traffic that uses the undersea cable system, which carries many times more traffic than the satellite system does.

The focus on the undersea internet and its growth and protection have become much more of a main stage topic since February 2008. The events occurred over a series of days and were carried out predominantly in Middle Eastern waters. Many countries had their internet services dramatically reduced as a result of the attacks.

From late January to early February, as many as nine undersea internet cables were severed. Dr. Richard Sauder wrote an interesting review of the information provided by various reporting agencies on these events.

- Quoting the New York Times, Dr. Sauder stated, “During the height of the disruption, some 70 percent of the Egyptian Internet was down” (2008).
- Here, Dr. Sauder quotes CNN when discussing the first two cables that were severed, “The two cables account for as much as three-quarters of the international communications between Europe and the Middle East“ (2008).
- An English Daily in the UAE, the Khaleej Times, offered this statistic, “An estimated 1.7 million Internet users in the UAE have been affected by the recent undersea cable damage, an expert said yesterday, quoting recent figures published by TeleGeography.” The Times also mentioned a key point to this paper, “Almost 90 per cent of Internet traffic is routed through undersea cables and only 10 per cent is done through the satellite” (2008).

These points outline the importance of undersea cable technology and its protection. How we manage security issues revolving around the maintenance and use of these giant cables will play a major role in the continuity and future use of the net.

Building new alliances and agreements that are contemporary with the technology that now exists related to the Internet has to be considered a major issue confronting government today. The very fact that most of the cable attacks occurred in Middle Eastern waters carries many political implications. While many unrelated sources have claimed that Iran was the target of these events, many countries suffered major reductions in internet traffic capabilities as well.

Various reporting agencies discussed the following list of undersea internet cables that were compromised during that short timeframe in early 2008: A cable off of Marseille, France; two off of Alexandria, Egypt; one off of Dubai, in the Persian Gulf; one off of Bandar Abbas, Iran in the Persian Gulf; one between Qatar and the UAE, in the Persian Gulf; one in the Suez Canal, Egypt; and a cable near Penang, Malaysia.

Additionally, an initially unreported cable cut on 23 January 2008 affected the following undersea internet cables: the SeaMeWe-4 (South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe-4) near Penang, Malaysia; the FLAG Europe-Asia near Alexandria; FLAG cable near the Dubai coast; FALCON undersea internet cable near Bandar Abbas in Iran; and SeaMeWe-4, also near Alexandria (Kaleej, 2008).

The impact of these cables being severed is summed up nicely by Computer Weekly: “As the undersea cables carry about 95% of the world’s telephone and internet traffic, any widespread internet downtime can have devastating economic implications” (2008). With dozens of new cables to be laid in the next few years, as reported by PC Pro in July of 2008, any disruption in the cables will have massive impact on internet users.

Conversely, one could argue that with more cables being laid, some redundancy will occur so that the increased number of undersea cables will ensure greater continuity in times of cable breakdown. In any event, protecting these cables has become more of a hot topic after these attacks. The idea that submarines may carry men close enough to the cables to cut or otherwise damage them brings other goals to mind. A possibility exists that during the downtime of the cables, monitoring devices may be attached to gain some amount of unrestricted access to the transmissions running through the cable.

Competing governments have a direct pecuniary interest in the construction, laying, and maintenance of these cables. Control of or influence on these cables by any one entity could dramatically impact internet availability for a given population as well as information access by various governments.

The undersea cable network still carries most internet traffic and is still growing. The issue is not in building the cables, but in protecting them. Many traditional agreements between nations regarding information transfer and jurisdiction will come under fire as this unbridled communication network grows and its security becomes more and more of an international concern.","The article titled 'A Vulnerable Network: Undersea Internet Cable Attacks' provides a comprehensive examination of incidents involving severed undersea internet cables, particularly focusing on events from early 2008.

NEW DELHI: Internet speeds in India, especially for customers of Bharti Airtel, Tata Communications, and state-owned BSNL and MTNL, are set to be disrupted for the next 20-25 days after a key undersea cable, carrying data traffic across 14 countries, from Singapore to France, was cut off the coast of Egypt. Two other key cable networks, linking Asia to Europe, were also allegedly damaged.

The extent of the damage is still being assessed. ""Currently, internet and data usage are low because of the festive season. India will feel the impact from Monday when offices and businesses come back. Telcos have diverted all traffic from the Atlantic route to the Pacific, but our connectivity to the latter route is not sufficient to cater to all of India’s traffic,"" explained Rajesh Chharia, president at Association of Internet Service Providers of India.

Bharti Airtel said that the cable cuts had not impacted its voice traffic but was taking all ‘necessary steps to ensure data services were available to our customers by routing traffic on alternative routes’. BSNL executives stated the company was diverting its traffic on other cables linking India with Europe and the US but declined to reveal the extent of internet disruptions here. Reliance Communications said its customers were not impacted as its cable systems were not affected when the undersea cables were allegedly sabotaged.

Executives with mobile phone companies acknowledged that browsing speeds were likely to fall significantly in the coming days, even as they were unable to provide a timeframe for when the problem will be resolved.

Businesses face risks from undersea data cable vulnerabilities.

Crisscrossing the ocean floor, undersea optical fiber data cables are an essential component of an increasingly interconnected world, quietly carrying massive amounts of data communications between the Earth’s landmasses.

But they are not invulnerable. Individual cables are severed or damaged dozens of times each year, most commonly by fishing boat anchors, but also by storms, scrap collectors and even shark bites.

The U.S. and other major markets, like Europe and Japan, are served by numerous cables, providing enough redundancy that traffic from a single damaged cable is rerouted before end users even notice. Wider outages, however, can have more far-reaching effects.

That’s why in October 2015, when Russian ships were observed lurking near undersea data cables, U.S. military and intelligence officials were concerned about possible sabotage.

Some experts, however, see that as unlikely.

""Cables during peacetime are protected by law under the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,"" said Keith Schofield, general manager of the International Cable Protection Committee, representing the submarine cable community of interest.

Attempted sabotage, he said, would likely be detectable and stopped before any significant harm could be done to trunk cable routes.

Seismic activity, however, has been known to damage enough cables to cause wide service interruptions and service degradation, even in areas with ample cable connections.

A 2006 earthquake in Taiwan severed several undersea cables, causing major disruptions in Asia and ripple effects that interrupted phone service to Europe. Smaller incidents can have far reaching impacts, as well.

When cables are cut, rerouted data can overwhelm unaffected networks, causing slowdowns even for those not directly affected. Smaller countries with less redundancy — and the companies doing business with them — can suffer substantial repercussions from such events.

As businesses become increasingly dependent on fast data communications, even minor slowdowns can impede business. For web-centric and cloud-based companies, as well as content providers, such slowdowns could be a serious problem.

The undersea cable industry goes to great lengths to ensure uninterrupted service. ""The systems are built with redundancy in mind,"" said Peter Jamieson, chair of the industry group European Subsea Cable Association.

Excess capacity is also built into the system. Most cables were originally built to handle optical data traffic in a single wavelength, but they now use a technique called Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM), which handles many wavelengths.

Routing protocols ensure that in the case of a service interruption, data instantaneously finds alternate routes. And the different cable owners work together in various consortia to operate roughly 60 cable-repair ships throughout the world, which are on call to ensure that any damage is repaired quickly. Repairs generally take a minimum of four days to complete.

Traditional business interruption coverage focuses on perils like flood and fire, power outages and physical infrastructure failures. But, when we move to businesses where data is a utility, we have a different sort of business interruption, and that is going to be increasingly important to service-based economies.

Businesses should know their providers’ contractual obligations and dependent business interruption coverage in case of outages, as spelled out in the service level agreement. 

Even with coverage, however, calculating business interruption losses, especially for traders and other market-dependent businesses, can be extremely difficult, particularly during incidents that may themselves be roiling the markets.","The article titled ""Severed Communications"" discusses the vulnerabilities of undersea data cables, which are essential for global communications.

HÀ NỘI — Three international undersea cables out of the primary five connecting Việt Nam to the world are suffering issues, which could seriously impact connection speed and reliability.

The Asia Pacific Gateway (APG) was the latest – following Asia America Gateway (AAG) and AAE-1 (Asia-Africa-Euro 1) – to see disruptions after a problem on the S6 segment (near Hong Kong, China) was reported on Monday morning, according to an internet service provider.

This is the fourth time in 2022 the cable faced problems, after problems in April, July, and September. The September issue suffered a problem on the S9 segment (to Singapore) and was only fully repaired on November 14.

Vietnamese internet service providers have yet to receive notices from the cable management unit on the causes or the repair plans for the current issue.

The 10,400km-long APG line was first operational in December 2016.

It was invested by four Vietnamese internet service providers – VNPT, Viettel, FPT and CMC.

AAE-1 was suffering from a ‘shunt fault’ problem on the S1H segment, also near Hong Kong area, since November this year. The AAG is seeing several issues on S1B and S1B segments (near Brunei) and S1H and S1I segments (near Hong Kong).

The problems on these lines have not been fully addressed yet, making it harder for internet providers to ensure the quality of the connections to their consumers.

Only two other lines that connect Việt Nam to the world – SMW3 (SEA-ME-WE3) and Intra Asia (IA) – are running without disruptions.","The article titled ""Submarine internet cable APG sees disruptions for fourth time in 2022"" discusses significant disruptions to multiple submarine cables, including the Asia Pacific Gateway (APG), Asia America Gateway (AAG), and Asia-Africa-Euro 1 (AAE-1).

99% of the internet network runs through submarine cables. It is estimated that over USD 10,000 billion in financial transactions run today through these “seabed highways”. This is especially the case of the main global financial exchange system, SWIFT, which has recently been banned for many Russian banks. The security of these transactions is a political, economic, and social problem.  

Submarine internet cables have a crucial importance, like oil and gas pipelines. In the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the seabed is more than ever a battlefield that must be protected. Western armed forces are considering a nightmare scenario of total interruption of the Internet in Europe, as 99% of the global network runs through submarine cables.  

These infrastructures are equally important today as oil and gas pipelines. On average, there are over a hundred breaks of submarine cables every year, often caused by fishing boats. The first attacks of the modern age date back to 2017. In 2007, Vietnamese fishermen cut a subsea cable to recover materials, disrupting connectivity for three weeks.  

Creating a European program to increase capabilities to prevent attacks on this infrastructure is urgent. Russian vessels are increasingly traversing the coasts of France and Ireland, following the routes of these cables.  

Recent attacks on cables suggest a new development, recalling historical attacks during the First World War and the Spanish-American War. Russia has shown interest in NATO’s subsea infrastructure, raising concerns about hybrid actions in the maritime field.  

The first risk factor is the growing volume of data, encouraging third countries to spy on or disrupt traffic. The second risk factor involves the increasing capital intensity of these facilities, leading to international consortia that may include state actors. The most vulnerable points are where cables reach land, particularly landing stations.  

Solutions in case of multiple attacks are being investigated by the US executive.

Published Date: 12/22/2008  
  
European rescue boats rushed to the sea on Friday, with the express ""find and fix"" command firmly issued by telecommunications companies in both the Middle East and Europe. It's believed that the underwater lines were severed by an inattentive captain, who lowered the anchor of his ship in a place where such action is expressly forbidden, due to the hazard of entanglement on the floor of the Mediterranean Sea. The split occurred somewhere between Sicily and Tunis, but the engineer ships still have a tough time tracking down the ends of each cable.  
  
If an anchor indeed ripped the two cable apart, then it's possible that the severed ends of the lines are miles apart from each other. That's why engineers already started scanning the bottom of the ocean with an automated submersible, dubbed Hector. The little submarine, controlled from a ship above, will scout the deep sea, in search for the ends of each line. Finding them fast could potentially save millions of dollars.  
  
Once the ends are located, they will be brought to the surface, and stitched back together. However, this is a very difficult process, as a France Telecom Marine spokesman, Louis-Michel Aymard, admitted on Sunday. ""We have to fix the cable fibre by fibre, and it's a very huge cable."" The cables were allowed some leeway, instead of being firmly attached to the ocean floor, to compensate for drifting current or anchor hits. But accidents where the anchors sever the cables are not uncommon.  
  
Egypt already managed to divert a substantial part of its Internet and telephone traffic through auxiliary lines, and is therefore safeguarded against any negative effects that the rupture may have. However, other Middle Eastern nations are not that fortunate and depend substantially on the two cables. If the teams of engineers fail to reconnect them soon, then this seemingly harmless incident could translate into an increase in the economic difficulties prompted by the international financial crisis.","The article titled ""Underwater Data Cables Severed by Ship Anchor"" discusses an incident where underwater data cables were severed by a ship's anchor.

"Severed Cable Disrupts Internet Access","65% of internet traffic to India affected; disruptions in communications across Europe, the Middle East, and Asia due to severed FLAG FEA, SMW4, and SMW3 cables.","http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7792688.stm","","",Yes,-,"London, England, GB",-,"2008-12-19","English","British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)","**Severed cable disrupts net access**  

Internet and phone communications between Europe, the Middle East, and Asia have been seriously disrupted after submarine cables were severed.  
It is thought the FLAG FEA, SMW4, and SMW3 lines, near the Alexandria cable station in Egypt, have all been cut.  
A fault was also reported on the GO submarine cable 130km off Sicily.  
Experts warned that it may be days before the fault is fixed and said the knock-on effect could have serious repercussions on regional economies.

Jonathan Wright, director of wholesale products at Interoute which manages part of the optical fibre network, told the BBC that the effects of the break would be felt for many days.  
""This will grind economies to a halt for a short space of time,"" he said. ""If you look at, say, local financial markets who trade with European and US markets, the speed at which they get live data will be compromised.""

""If you think how quickly trades can be placed, if they are suffering from bad latency times, then by the time a trade is placed, the market may well have moved on.""

The cause of the break is as yet unknown, although some seismic activity was reported near Malta shortly before the cut was detected.  
In a statement released in relation to one of the breaks, France Telecom said: ""The causes of the cut, which is located in the Mediterranean between Sicily and Tunisia, on sections linking Sicily to Egypt, remain unclear.""

The French firm said it was sending a ship out to fix the line between Italy and Egypt, although it could take until 31 December to fully repair the line.  
The main damage is to the four submarine cables running across the Mediterranean and through the Suez Canal.  
It is thought that 65% of traffic to India was down, while services to Singapore, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Taiwan and Pakistan have also been severely affected.

Earlier this year, the same line was damaged in the same area - off the Egyptian coast - although only two lines were snapped then.  
""We've lost three out of four lines. If the fourth cable breaks, we're looking at a total blackout in the Middle East,"" said Mr. Wright.  
""These three circuits account for 90% of the traffic and we're going to see more international phone calls dropping and a huge degradation in the quality of local internet,"" he added.  
""Normally you would expect to see one major break per cable per year. With four you should have an insurance policy. For this to happen twice in one year, on the same cable, is a serious cause for concern.""  

**A selection of your comments on this story:**  
Over weekend 13th to 16th December had considerable delays and time-outs reaching my email server in Germany and various homepages in Switzerland and the UK.  
I suspected that a breakdown somewhere was at fault but was surprised to be unable to get any info from Google etc.  
You can check your ADSL speed easily but finding the speed of a connection from one continent to another seems to be lacking.  

**John Russell, Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia**  
I began downloading something this afternoon but late this evening it suddenly became six or seven times slower.  
I now know why.  

**Max, Wallasey, UK**  
I teach English at a high school in Sisaket.  
The last few days our connections have been very, very slow.  
Yesterday, when I was trying to teach some students how to use Limewire to download movies and songs, the connection seemed to be nearly non-existent.  
We thought that maybe the wire to our building had been damaged.  

**Les Blane, Sisaket, Thailand**  
I work at a call centre.  
We are unable to make calls as the latency is too high which only ends up in dropping of every call that we dial and the internet speed has been downgraded like anything.  
I hope this gets fixed by Sunday (December 21), otherwise we will be in total blackout and will suffer in great loss of business in this high time.  

**Adeel Awan, Karachi, Pakistan**  
Yesterday's cuts in Malta were a big hassle to all GO subscribers.  
One here seems to all of a sudden realise how dependent we all are on internet.  
At least alternative measures have been taken in Malta by GO in conjunction with another internet service provider which was not affected, and therefore today almost all Malta is back to normal - albeit with slower connections.  

**George Bugeja, Zebbug, Malta**  
Internet is very slow.  
I could not connect to any sites except by using a socks server I installed on one of my servers located in USA.  
I wonder why they do not use separated cables with separated routes?  
Why are the four main cables located with each other?  
It is just like putting all eggs in the same basket.  

**Walaa Waguih, Alexandria, Egypt**  
Currently staying in Brazil - cannot access virginmedia.com - don´t know if this has anything to do with the above.  

**Roger Francomb, Sao Paulo**  
One of my favourite sites was unavailable earlier.  
It's back up, but from conversations there are still others who cannot access the site, some in the same country as the site's servers.  

**Michael Harvey, Framingham, Massachusetts, United States**  
I had trouble with the net from earlier today which I thought had something to do with the local SP.  
The link gets disconnected frequently and even when you are connected it is terribly slow.

"Chinese Ship Damages Baltic Sea Internet Cables","Incident involving the NewNew Polar Bear damaging 2 subsea data cables and a gas pipeline, raising security concerns for Europe.","https://carnegieendowment.org/emissary/2024/12/baltic-sea-internet-cable-cut-europe-nato-security","2024-12-03T12:00:00.000Z","",Yes,"Sophia Besch, Erik Brown, and James C. Gaither.","Brussels, Belgium",-,"2024-12-03","English","Carnegie Europe","If I had a nickel for every time a Chinese ship was dragging its anchor on the bottom of the Baltic Sea in the vicinity of important cables, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis posted on X (formerly Twitter) on November 20, ""I would have two nickels, which isn’t much, but it’s weird that it happened twice."" The first instance was in October 2023, when the anchor of a Hong Kong–flagged, Chinese-registered vessel named NewNew Polar Bear damaged two subsea data cables and a gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea. The second incident occurred just over two weeks ago, when two subsea communications cables connecting Germany and Finland and Lithuania and Sweden, respectively, were allegedly severed by the Yi Peng 3, a Chinese cargo ship.

These are just two examples of a complex security challenge that Europe is learning to navigate. Over the past couple years, suspicious Russian activity near critical underwater infrastructure in NATO’s Northeast has alarmed European lawmakers regarding the security of their subsea data cables, which are vital for European internet connectivity and societal functioning. In response, NATO, the EU, and individual European governments have introduced a plethora of initiatives aimed at increasing know-how, capabilities, and awareness to secure these cables. Where in the past there were no contingency plans for sabotage, there are now more maritime patrols, an attempt to forge deeper intelligence connections, and the beginnings of a new relationship with the private sector.

Yet many of these efforts remain in their infancy. For decades, policymakers in Europe were intent on sheltering global assets, including telecommunications infrastructure, from securitization. Of the hundreds of disruptions to cables that occur each year, the vast majority are caused by accidental human activity, like fishing, or natural events, like earthquakes. Europe benefits from its many existing redundancies to protect against instances of cable damage—whether intentional or not. Although some internet traffic had to be rerouted because of the November cable breakages, there were no reports of widespread connectivity outages in Germany, Finland, Lithuania, or Sweden.

Nevertheless, Europe’s islands are more vulnerable to attacks against their limited number of subsea cables. And adversaries can use cable sabotage—causing delays or temporary loss in connectivity—as a low-cost way of unnerving societies below the threshold of a complete outage. Such events undermine the targets’ sense of security and allow the perpetrator to prepare for a broader attack. Even a modest disruption in internet connectivity that would be a minor nuisance to the general public could have drastic consequences for European and global financial markets, which rely on rapid information flows to optimally perform. Europeans have begun to recognize that damage to subsea data cables in their immediate vicinity could be part of a broader toolkit of hybrid aggression directed against them, in which single events do not amount to acts of war and attribution can be remarkably difficult.

European governments and militaries have placed their initial focus on Russia, given both the context of the war in Ukraine and a series of recent incidents linked back to the Kremlin. Russia has carried out underwater military exercises at depths below 6,000 meters, is ""actively mapping"" the critical undersea infrastructure of NATO members, and is increasing its activity over and around cables in the Baltic Sea. On multiple occasions, Russian vessels have also been known to be sailing near damaged European subsea data cables at the time of breakages. Several Western officials believe Russian intelligence agencies, not the Chinese government, were responsible for the damage from the most recent Baltic Sea cable cuts.

Lawmakers also worry about the possibility that both subsea cables themselves and the landing stations they connect to could be tapped by malign actors for espionage purposes. Officials in the United States and Europe have expressed concern over subsea data cables built and operated by China’s Huawei Marine Networks (HMN) Tech, citing cybersecurity and espionage risks. The United States has pushed particularly hard to persuade third countries, including its European allies, to avoid installing cables owned by Chinese companies. Europeans have not always shared this risk assessment, highlighted by the installation of the Pakistan and East Africa Connecting Europe Cable, a 25,000-kilometer project operated by HMN Tech that connects Singapore to Marseilles, France, that became fully operational in December 2022. But China’s increasingly blatant support for Russia’s war and the involvement of Chinese-flagged vessels in the two Baltic Sea cable-cutting incidents, has led Europe to begin to consider China as a threat to European security, including its subsea cables.

Transatlantic cooperation on this issue is complicated by fierce competition between U.S. and European cable installation companies, as demand for new systems continues to skyrocket. This increase is largely driven by U.S.-based hyperscalers—large-scale cloud providers such as Google and Meta—not telecommunications firms, and Europe lacks a peer competitor to these tech giants. Yet both European and U.S. policymakers have an interest in their allies’ industry leaders succeeding in this space and should consider the establishment of joint venture and technology sharing agreements among U.S. and European cable firms.

Even before the October 2023 incident, NATO, the EU, and certain European governments began to increase their efforts to boost subsea cable resilience and security. In February 2023, NATO stood up a new Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to convene stakeholders and enhance coordination between the public and private sectors. In July 2023, NATO allies at the Vilnius Summit established a Maritime Center for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure as part of the alliance’s Maritime Command in Northwood, UK. In October 2023, after the first incident, NATO defense ministers endorsed a new Digital Ocean Vision, an initiative aimed at improving undersea surveillance. And in February 2024, the European Commission released its first “Recommendation on Secure and Resilient Submarine Cable Infrastructures,” encouraging member states to conduct regular stress tests, improve information sharing amongst themselves, and improve cable maintenance and repair capabilities.

Three of the 16 subsea internet cables that run through the Strait of Bab el-Mandeb have gone down, according to the Wall Street Journal, degrading internet service to the Subcontinent and East Africa.

The Houthi leadership has denied any involvement or responsibility for the presumed damage to the cables, and the cause has not been established yet. It is possible that it was unintended: Anchor-drag accidents cut internet cables regularly in locations around the world, and the Red Sea has a high density of subsea telecom infrastructure. For the Houthis, though, it is clear that Western powers are responsible.

“The hostile acts against Yemen by naval military units belonging to Britain and the United States have caused an outage in the maritime cables in the Red Sea, jeopardizing the security and safety of international communications and the natural flow of information,” the Houthis' putative Ministry of Transport said in a statement Friday. ""[The U.S. and UK] are using hostile and illegal methods in their war against Yemen to serve the Zionist enemy (Israel), in order to continue committing genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza.”

The ministry added that it is ""keenly interested"" in the safety and security of subsea cables off the Yemeni coast, particularly since the cables serve nations with which the group has cordial relations. It promised to ""provide all services and grant necessary permits"" to cable companies to allow them to enter the area and make repairs.

The latter guarantee, if honored, would be of value to cable operators. The routine drumbeat of Houthi attacks on shipping have driven away half of the Red Sea's usual maritime traffic, and operating a slow-moving cable layer in high-risk waters near Yemen would require assurances from both sides of the standoff.

Some maritime analysts have noted that the bulker Rubymar, which was hit by a Houthi missile two weeks ago, may have crossed over some of the cable routes while it was abandoned and adrift. The crew dropped anchor before they left their stricken ship, but the vessel meandered northwards for 13 days - potentially dragging anchor - before it finally went down.","The article titled 'Houthis Blame Western Alliance for Subsea Cable Damage' directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables by discussing damage to subsea internet cables in the Red Sea.

By Admire Moyo, ITWeb's news editor.  
Johannesburg, 30 Mar 2020  

In February, cable ship Leon Thevenin was used to fix broken undersea cables.  

A cable vessel is on its way to fix the broken West Africa Cable System (WACS) submarine cable that is causing slow Internet speeds in SA.  

This is according to the latest reports from the RENAlerts service by SANReN and TENET. The reports say it is estimated the repair will be completed by 4 April.  

The cable break was first revealed on Saturday by the South African National Research & Education Network (SANReN), a major user of the cable, which detected the break just before midnight.  

The break came at a time when South African Internet service providers (ISPs) are reporting increased network traffic as more people are working and learning from home to curb the spreading of the coronavirus.  

Says SANReN in a tweet: ""WACS Outage Update: Cable vessel, the ‘Ile D'Aix’, under way to the SV8 (Highbridge UK) side cable break. ETA at cable ground –Tue 31/03/2020 09h00 UTC. Estimated repair date: Sat 04/04/2020.""  

WACS is a submarine communications cable linking SA with the UK along the west coast of Africa that was constructed by Alcatel-Lucent.  

The cable consists of four fibre pairs and is 14 530km in length, linking from Yzerfontein in the Western Cape of SA to London in the UK.  

In January, WACS also suffered a cable break together with the SAT3/WASC cable, resulting in slow Internet speeds in SA.  

The cables were fully restored in February.  

### Contingency plans  
For the latest break, ISPs have started putting in place contingency measures to mitigate the slow speeds.  

Liquid Telecom SA, part of Pan-African telecoms group Liquid Telecom, yesterday announced it had mitigated network outages due to the unexpected loss of connectivity following a recent break in the WACS undersea cable.  

“To help ensure continuity of service, Liquid Telecom’s network traffic is automatically re-routed during such outages,” says Reshaad Sha, CEO of Liquid Telecom South Africa.  

“We are responding to new and increased demand from customers with additional capacity across alternate routes. Liquid Telecom operates a five-cable system for our international Internet capacity in South Africa. Our resilient architecture means the loss of the WACS capacity is unlikely to impact customers’ connectivity as demand surges.”  

Last year, Liquid Telecom South Africa announced its advanced core network enhancements offering customers near unlimited bandwidth capacity, says the company.  

“The replacement of our core network has not only catered to legacy performance issues but has made Liquid Telecom’s network one of the most technologically advanced, modern and reliable networks in South Africa and across the African continent. It has also addressed one of the core needs of local enterprises around network capacity,” Sha adds.  

Seacom says while repairs on the WACS undersea cable systems are being planned, many ISPs will need to re-route their traffic via alternative paths, such as Seacom’s east coast undersea cable or other routes.  

As a result of the WACS cable system issues, customers may experience increased latency as alternative routes are implemented.  

“Seacom is aware that due to issues on the WACS cable system on Africa’s west coast, many African ISPs and their customers could be experiencing unstable or slower speeds when using the Internet. Seacom’s network platform is also affected by the WACS issues, but as the Seacom cable system on Africa’s east coast is continuing to work normally, Seacom endeavours to provide ISPs that rely heavily on WACS with diverse capacity on the Seacom cable system,” the company says in a statement.  

Meanwhile, Angola Cables says: “Angola Cables has announced there has been an interruption in the supply of services on the submarine cable section of WACS which connects Seixal, Portugal to Highbridge in England.  

However, it says the services that Angola Cables provides to its customers remain operational across the 11 WACS cable contact points on the west coast of Africa.  

Data connections and access to global content and services continue to be provided – given the robustness and redundancy of the Angola Cables network, it notes.  

“As a top priority, Angola Cables and the consortium of WACS partners are working to restore the cable's full capacity to impacted customers as soon as possible.”  

Telkom unit Openserve says it has activated additional international connectivity capacity. It explains this additional capacity will alleviate and minimise impact on Openserve’s network, and that of its clients, while repairs to the WACS and SAT3/WACS cable systems continue.  

“We expect to have a full capacity when the SAT3 system comes alive tonight,” says the company.","The article discusses the broken West Africa Cable System (WACS), detailing its implications on internet connectivity in South Africa.

Full repairs to three submarine internet cables damaged in the Red Sea in February are being held up by disputes over who controls access to infrastructure in Yemeni waters.  
The Yemeni government has granted permits for the repair of two out of three cables, but refused the third because of a dispute with one of the cable’s consortium members.  
Repairs to the Seacom and EIG cables have been approved, but the consortium that runs AAE-1, which includes telecommunications company TeleYemen, was not granted a permit by Yemen’s internationally recognized government, according to documents seen by Bloomberg.  
Three out of more than a dozen cables that run through the Red Sea, a critical route for connecting Europe’s internet infrastructure to Asia’s, were knocked offline by the Houthi-sunk Rubymar vessel in late February. Although the telecommunications data that passes along the damaged cables was re-routed, the incident highlighted the vulnerability of critical subsea infrastructure and the challenges of making repairs in a conflict zone.  
The dispute over the third cable derives from the split political control of TeleYemen, the country’s sole telecommunications provider, a reflection of the country’s broader geopolitical divisions. The company has two branches, one in Aden under control of the internationally recognized Yemeni government, and the other in Sanaa under the control of the Houthi militia group. The Yemeni government refused to cooperate with the Houthi-linked part of TeleYemen associated with the AAE-1 cable consortium and sought to appoint a representative from the Aden branch, according to the documents. But the consortium didn’t approve the alternative representative and Yemen’s government declined to grant a permit, according to the documents.  
E-Marine, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi-based Emirates Telecommunications Group Co. PJSC, is contracted to carry out the repairs.  
The Aden branch of TeleYemen, affiliated with the Yemeni government, wrote a letter to Yemen’s Telecommunications Ministry demanding that E-Marine provide a £10 million ($12.5 million) bank guarantee to ensure it would not carry out any repairs on the AAE-1 cable when the company was fixing the other two cables until the dispute was resolved. The ministry initially approved the condition, according to the documents, but Yemen’s cabinet decided it wasn’t necessary, a senior government official told Bloomberg.  
E-Marine did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Houthi telecommunications ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  
It’s unclear if the Houthis, an Iran-backed militia group which controls much of Yemen’s Red Sea coastline, including the key port of Hodeida, will let E-Marine fix the two cables. The group, which has been attacking ships in the area with drones and missiles for months, has previously said only it can grant permission for the repairs.  
The repair ships will take about a week to reach the cables and then approximately two days to fix each one, according to Seacom Ltd.’s Prenesh Padayachee. The cables will be lifted to the surface and fresh cable will be spliced in to replace the damaged sections.  
The repair crew will also assess the Rubymar, the Houthi-sunk ship whose anchor most likely severed the cables in February. Seacom estimates that the ship is currently about 1 kilometer away from its cable, Padayachee said, and seems to be stable.  
""But we don’t want to do a repair and then have this vessel falling into the new cables,"" he said. ""In all likelihood it will have to be moved.""  
The three damaged cables carry about 25% of traffic in the region, according to estimates from Hong Kong-based internet provider HGC Global Communications, which uses the cables.

Three men have been arrested by the Egyptian army for apparently trying to cut through an undersea Internet cable. A patrol stopped a fishing boat near the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria and arrested three divers, an army spokesman said on his official Facebook page.

It is believed they were trying to cut through an SEA-ME-WE 4 undersea cable - one of the main connections between Asia and Europe, running from France to Malaysia and linking Italy, North Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. If the men had been successful, experts warned they could have taken an 'entire continent offline', but interruptions were reported around the region, including Dubai and India, today.

The cable targeted, the SEA-ME-WE 4, is 18,800 kilometres long, and is the primary internet 'backbone' between Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, and Europe. It has 17 landing points, which are the areas where the cable comes ashore.

No indication of who the men were or what their motive for cutting the cable was. It is also unclear how much damage was done. But Sky News reported that there was evidence of slow internet connections as far away as Pakistan and India, according to a network security firm which studies web traffic.

The cable is owned by Telecom Egypt, the biggest web provider in the North African country, and slow services were expected to be improved by the end of the day.

Under the sea lies a multi-billion-dollar network of high-power cables through which 99 percent of global internet traffic travels. Submarine cables are expensive to build, but they deliver a huge amount of capacity. Failures can be catastrophic. One cable failure - between Sicily and Egypt - left more than 50 percent of India without power in 2008, sending the country's computer industry and stock markets offline for hours.

In the past week, there have been several reports of severed cables off the coast of Egypt that are part of Seacom, a network of cables serving much of Africa. It had been thought that ships had accidentally caught the cables, but there are now concerns there could be a concerted effort to take down Egypt’s connectivity, although it has not been confirmed whether the incidents are connected.","The article extensively covers the topic of cut sea cables by detailing an incident where three Egyptian divers attempted to cut the SEA-ME-WE 4 undersea cable, which is a crucial connection for internet traffic between Asia and Europe.

It discusses the potential consequences of this action, stating that if successful, it could have taken an entire continent offline.

The article also provides context about the cable's significance, mentioning that it is a primary internet backbone and has previously suffered damage that affected internet connectivity across multiple regions, including Dubai and India.

Additionally, it references other recent cable cuts in the region, indicating a broader issue with undersea cable security and connectivity.

Overall, the article is centered around the topic of cut sea cables and their implications for internet connectivity."

Huge numbers in Egypt and India were left struggling to get online as a result of the outage, when the major internet pipeline between Egypt and Italy was cut.  
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) throughout the region, including those in United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, also reported problems. International telephone calls, which have also been affected, are being rerouted to work around the problem.  
Industry experts told _The Times_ that two sub-sea cables went down just off Alexandra, causing the mass disruption. It happens to a single cable typically once a year, and companies have developed the fail-safe of redirecting traffic to a second cable should this occur.  
""It is incredibly rare to experience a dual-break where both cables are down simultaneously,"" said a spokesperson for Interoute, the internet networks company.  
The Egyptian ministry said it will take ""several days"" for cables to be repaired and is trying to reroute Egypt's internet connections.  
Indian ISPs said their problems were due to the cable damage off Egypt. Speaking to reporters, Rajesh Chharia, president of the Internet Service Providers' Association of India, said: ""Information technology companies, software companies and call centres that provide online services to the UK or the US east coast are the worst affected.""

It is likely to hit businesses who will struggle to communicate in the affected countries.** Call-centres who work for British companies are likely to be offline or hard to contact in the coming days. Others warned that bank and stock market trading could be affected.  
The digital blackout highlighted the _vulnerability of global communications_. Hundreds of millions of people access the web, but the vast majority of international traffic runs through a small amount of cables submerged below the sea.  
**Industry insiders warned that a domino effect was occurring today, causing the disruption to spread across the globe.** As companies' private internet services went down, workers were forced to use the public internet and mobile phones to communicate. This has resulted in a heavy strain on phone and internet networks, meaning calls could go down and cause the internet to become slower or blackout completely.","The article discusses the damage to undersea cables in detail, highlighting the significant internet disruptions it caused across multiple countries.

"Unraveling Subsea Cable Failure in Offshore Wind","50% of insurance claims in offshore wind are linked to subsea cable damage; average costs of cable failures significantly impact industry finances.","https://www.imca-int.com/published-articles/imcas-new-code-of-practice-could-save-millions-for-the-offshore-wind-industry-by-preventing-subsea-cable-failure","","",Yes,"Mark Ford","London, England","3000","2023-11-02","English",-,"**Unraveling Subsea Cable Failure in Offshore Wind**  
Published on 2 November 2023  
According to a report by GCube Insurance in 2021, the average insurance claim nearly doubled from £1.7 million (€2 million) in 2010-2015 to £3.1 million (€3.6 million) in 2020. In total, claims for offshore wind grew from around £124 million (€145 million) in 2010-2015 to around £500 million (€585 million) in 2020. Of these, around 50% were down to damage to subsea cables, with other insurers estimating that damaged subsea cables represent between 70% and 80% of their claims.

It is clear to me that if we are to meet the huge ambitions placed on Offshore Wind by nations around the globe and meet Net Zero targets, we will need to find new – and better – ways of working.

A recurring problem for the Offshore Wind industry is damage caused to the submarine power cables during the installation process – nine out of ten insurance claims on cables are due to installation damage, and the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult in the UK estimates that damage incurred during installation contributed to 46% of all power cable failures.

At the point at which cables leave the laying vessel and meet the seabed, they are frequently subject to damage caused by over-bending, cable-pulling, and inadequate design of lead into the monopile. While installation contractors can use Sonar or ROV monitoring to observe the cable as it leaves the vessel, this is an expensive approach which will not work if stirred-up sediment is affecting visibility. Finding a way to detect installation damage should be an essential priority for the industry.

In a study carried out in 2019 by the University of Strathclyde, the average rate of power cable failure is approximately 0.003 failures/km/year for European wind farms. This means that a wind farm with 100km of power cable has a 30% chance of cable failure in any given year. The average downtime for an inter-array cable repair is around 40 days, and 60 days for an export cable. On average, inter-array cable damage costs between $1.8 million to $12 million, and export cable damage costs between $10 million to $30 million.

Faced with this technical challenge, the industry has now responded through the International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA) with a new Code of Practice (IMCA M264) which applies to all vessels that lay cables in an offshore environment and which sets a new baseline for successful cable installation.  

Building on the technical expertise of IMCA and its Members, the new document sets the standard of acceptable practice for everyone in the industry, including energy companies. As a Code of Practice, it will be used to formulate technical specifications within contracts, which means it can potentially have a huge and positive impact on an industry looking for practical solutions and tangible improvements to how we work.

Mark Ford is the Marine and Quality Manager at IMCA.","The article titled 'Unravelling subsea cable failure in offshore wind' extensively discusses the topic of subsea cables, particularly focusing on the failures and damages incurred during installation.

It highlights that around 50% of insurance claims in the offshore wind sector are related to damage to subsea cables, with specific emphasis on installation-related failures.

The article provides concrete statistics, such as the average costs associated with cable damage and the implications for the offshore wind industry, demonstrating that cut sea cables are a central theme rather than a minor mention.

"Undersea Cables","Explores the critical role of Submarine Communications Cables with a focus on vulnerabilities and the impact of cable cutting on global internet connectivity.","http://www.hisutton.com/Undersea_Cables.html","","H I Sutton",Yes,"H I Sutton",-,-,"2023-02-06","English",-,"**Russian capabilities against undersea cables**  
A recently published article by British Member of Parliament Rishi Sunak shows the growing awareness of a new fundamental weakness of NATO countries. The concern is that an adversary could gain a strategic advantage by interrupting internet and telecommunications between countries at a critical moment by attacking the numerous Submarine Communications Cables (SCC) which litter the sea floor between countries. There is also the concern that this type of activity could take place within the context of HYBRID WARFARE. The ground truth of this new naval arena clearly favors Russia both in terms of naval investment and the circumstances of geography.  

This article summarizes my own thoughts and analysis on the topic. Corrections and comments welcome.  

The tactic of cutting undersea communications cables goes back at least as far as World War One when Britain cut German cables in the English Channel to force the Germans to use long distance radio transmissions instead. This gave British Intelligence the opportunity to intercept and decrypt the communications, ultimately providing the Zimmerman Telegram which played a part in bringing the United States into the war. In World War Two, British X-Craft midget submarines attacked two Japanese cables. These missions were an absolute success but are less well known than the X-Craft attacks on ships. The uneasy peace of the Cold War meant that most subsequent cable operations were focused on intelligence gathering, with the US Navy famously tapping Soviet communication cables in Operation IVY BELLS.  

The modern reality is that Western economies are more dependent than ever on underseas cables. Sunak notes that SCCs transmit $10,000,000,000,000 of financial transactions per day, plus vast amounts of data. Were the network to disappear, the entire capacity of the earth’s satellite network could handle just 7% of the communications currently sent via cable from the United States alone.  

**Shallow Water Threat**  
Logically, Submarine Communications Cables (SCCs) are most vulnerable in shallow water. To break a single cable close to shore does not require serious technological investment; in 2013 the Egyptian Navy arrested three scuba divers attempting to cut the SE-WE-ME-4 cable in waters off Alexandria. These instances are mostly close inshore and are often localized in impact and relatively quickly fixed. Since there are multiple cables between most countries, one outage is unlikely to seriously damage an economy, or vital communications, in peacetime conditions.  

In Hybrid Warfare, naval Special Forces (Spetsnaz) divers could be used to cut cables. These would operate from civilian vessels or conventional submarines. Russian conventional submarines only have a limited combat swimmer capability; however, the Spetsnaz capability is significant enough to be considered a real threat to cables in shallow water.  

**Russian investment in Seabed Warfare**  
To cut a cable covertly, and in water deep enough to seriously hamper repairs, takes a certain amount of specialist hardware. Russia has been investing in this type of capability since the 1960s and has continued to grow their Special Mission submarine fleet. This submarine fleet, now including 9 nuclear-powered boats, is based in Olenya Guba on the edge of the Kola Peninsula in the Arctic.  

**Factors affecting targeting of Submarine Communication Cables**  
Covert operations employing Russia’s Special Mission submarines would have to take place within certain parameters. By compiling these it would be possible to identify the most likely zones for such operations.","The article 'Undersea Cables' by H I Sutton directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables, detailing historical and modern implications of cable cutting, particularly in the context of military strategy.

It discusses the vulnerabilities of Submarine Communications Cables (SCCs) and their critical role in global communications, emphasizing the severe impact that cutting these cables would have on internet connectivity.

This article on subsea cable threats is consistently the most read UltramapGlobal article throughout 2018 and 2019 so we’ve updated it for March 2020.  
Subsea cables carry data and energy keeping our world connected so why wouldn’t you protect them from damage that can mostly be prevented?  
The subsea cables market is growing. As of 2019 there were approximately [378 subsea cables in service globally spanning over 1.2 million kilometres](https://www2.telegeography.com/submarine-cable-faqs-frequently-asked-questions) carrying power and transmitting data from continent to continent.  
By the time we progress further into 2020 it’s estimated there will be around 2 million kilometers of subsea cables worldwide.  
**Subsea cable threats**  
Around 70% of all cable faults are caused by fishing and anchoring activities (man-made) and around 14% are caused by natural hazards (current abrasion or earthquakes).  
The 70% caused by man-made activity is made up of…  
**Fishing activity from trawlers** – Over a 3rd of all cable damage is caused by fishing activity. Trawling and fixed nets including stow nets cause damage. The East Asian region has high cable fault rates as stow nets are used intensively in the East China Sea. Their large anchors drag through the mud and damage cables. Pair trawling uses a net towed between two vessels which can snag cables resting on the seabed causing damage.  
**Damage from anchors** – 25% of subsea cable damage arises from ship anchors. Large anchors of fishing vessels and merchant vessels cause cable damage. Anchoring outside designated areas causes damage. Dragging anchors in error during passage causes damage (recent fault records show that merchant ships sometimes do not fasten their anchors securely during short passages and these can cause cable damage).  
**Why proactively protect cables?**  
The obvious reasons to protect subsea cables are to:  
* Prevent damage from occurring in the first place which causes downtime whilst a cable is being repaired.  
* Avoid substantial repair bills that can run into millions.  
* Protect the uptime of customers services such as internet, telephone and electricity etc.  
* Potentially lower insurance costs.  
**How to protect cables**  
Most companies only react when cables are damaged in the first place. Only then do they implement some form of cable monitoring and protection to prevent future incidents.  
Man-made damage can be prevented by placing protection zones around cables that alert cable owners when a vessel is getting too close to their assets.

"Severed Fiber-Optic Cable Disrupts Internet in Alaska","Cut 34 miles north of Oliktok Point; affects internet and cell service for communities including Utqiagvik and Nome.","https://www.govtech.com/network/severed-fiber-optic-cable-leaves-alaskans-without-internet","","June 14, 2023 • Alena Naiden, Anchorage Daily News",Yes,"Alena Naiden","Folsom, California, US","4250","2023-06-14","English","Anchorage Daily News","Residents of several North Slope and Northwest Alaska communities have been experiencing Internet and cell service interruptions this week caused by a cut to the subsea fiber-optic network. The cut might take up to two months to repair, and telecommunications service providers are looking for short-term solutions to bring service back online.

Quintillion, which provides broadband connectivity in Arctic Alaska, on Sunday experienced a subsea fiber cut about 34 miles north of Oliktok Point, offshore from Utqiagvik, Quintillion President Mac McHale said. The cut caused a systemwide outage, affecting Utqiagvik, Wainwright, Point Hope, Kotzebue, Nome and Atqasuk, McHale said.

""All of our broadband services are impacted by this,"" McHale said. ""And they're not compromised — they're completely out.""

While the company was still confirming the cause of the breakage on Monday, heavy ice movement most likely cut the fiber cable, McHale said. The breakage is significant, given the fact that the cable is buried beneath the ocean floor, below 90 feet of water, McHale said.

To fix the cut, repair crews need to wait until the ice breaks up around Oliktok Point, which is expected to happen at the end of June or early July, McHale said.

""We'll be on-site at that point in time,"" he said. ""We're looking at probably six to eight weeks.""

As of Monday, the company was working to isolate the repairs, assess the damage and find the right tools to conduct the repairs, McHale said. They were also looking for backup solutions in the meantime.

Quintillion's customers include telecom companies across Northwest Alaska and the North Slope, such as Alaska Communications, GCI, OTZ Telecommunications and Arctic Slope Telephone Association Cooperative.

The North Slope communities served by the Arctic Slope Telephone Association Cooperative were experiencing various levels of outages Monday, said Rebecca Sparks, ASTAC external relations manager.

""We have four communities with varied outages. They vary from community to community, but overall we have long-distance cellular and Internet outages taking place,"" she said. ""They can call within their community.""

In several North Slope villages, not including Utqiagvik, backup 911 services were also affected by the outages, Sparks said.

Utqiagvik resident Mary Lum Patkotak said that she had no Internet at work and couldn't make cellphone calls.

""It's extremely frustrating not to be able to contact my children and nieces,"" she said. ""We are so used to being connected.""

In the Northwest Arctic Borough, Kotzebue residents were experiencing Internet outages Monday, said Kelly Williams, CEO at OTZ Telecommunications. A backup facility kept voice and emergency services working.

""A few businesses are closed due to no Internet,"" Bruce Nelson of Kotzebue said. ""NAPA is cash only.""

The other 10 village communities served by OTZ Telecommunications are fed off a satellite system and don't rely on the subsea fiber-optic network, Williams said.

The company was also working on alternative satellite technologies to get Internet services up by the end of this week or early next week, Williams said.

Some GCI customers in rural Alaska — particularly those in Utqiagvik, Nome, Kotzebue, Wainwright and Point Hope — also experienced slower Internet and wireless service due to a network outage, GCI spokeswoman Heather Handyside said in a statement. Handyside said the company redistributed some of the services to other networks to address the issue.

""Shortly after the break was reported, GCI began to migrate some impacted services to GCI's satellite network,"" Handyside said. ""This transition was completed quickly.""","The article titled 'Severed Fiber-Optic Cable Leaves Alaskans Without Internet' discusses a specific incident involving a subsea fiber-optic cable cut 34 miles north of Oliktok Point, Alaska.

International internet connectivity between Africa and Europe has been affected by damage to Seacom undersea cable infrastructure.  
  
The company has issued several statements since Friday last week saying that they are in the process of restoring transmission. However, South African internet provider Internet Solutions notified their clients that repairs could last till April.  
  
In an email dated 23 March, Internet Solutions responded to a service request by saying that the impact of the current cut and subsequent repairs will be increased latency from South Africa, and “Repairs to be completed ETA 05 April 2013”.  
  
Seacom issued another statement regarding the repair process, indicating that “Seacom continues to work to restore transmission customers across the Mediterranean Sea. Optimisation of the IP network is also ongoing to relieve congestion where we can.”  
  
On Saturday 23 March, Seacom CEO Mark Simpson stated that while customers have been informed of a cable cut, the actual cause is still unknown and could take time to repair.  
  
“I know that many of you are keen to know the cause of the outage is a physical cable cut some kilometres north of the coast of Egypt in the Mediterranean Sea. This is not likely to be known until the cable is repaired in the coming week or two and the damaged section is recovered from the seabed and inspected,” he said.  
  
Simpson suspects that a large ship may be responsible for the damage, stating, “We suspect, based on our experience with sub-sea systems and the nature of the sea area where the cut has occurred, that the most likely cause is external aggression to the cable most probably caused by a larger vessel dragging its anchor across the sea bed.”  
  
“While we believed we had secured adequate restoration capacity between Egypt and Europe yesterday (Friday), it has since eventuated during today that the physical capability to connect this capacity to our services in Europe is neither adequate nor stable enough.”

"Repair Efforts for Severed Internet Cables","Repairing two severed internet cables in the Mediterranean Sea, causing 70% service disruption in Egypt and 60% in India, utilizing advanced Optical Time Domain Reflectometers.","http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7228315.stm","","",Yes,-,"London, England, GB","250000","2008-02-05","English","BBC News","**Work has begun to repair two damaged internet cables in the Mediterranean Sea that were severed last week.**

Flag Telecom, one of the firms responsible for the cables, says it will take about a week to be fixed.

The break in cables has caused disruption to net services in the Middle East and India. The cause is still not known.

Repairs will involve a team of about 50 people, including navigation experts and cable engineers, said Flag Telecom.

The ship that will repair the first severed cable is already in place, with repairs underway, while the second vessel is expected to begin work on Tuesday.

**Bespoke ships**

""It will be a highly technical job and should take a week to complete,"" a spokesperson for Flag Telecom told the BBC News website.

The cause of the damage has not been officially confirmed but there have been reports that the breaks were related to a tanker dragging its anchor along the sea bed.

However, the Egyptian communications ministry has denied any ships were in the area at the time of the break.

The first job in such a situation was to find the exact location of the damaged cable, said Mark Harper, manager of cable system support at Cable and Wireless.

Often the location of a break can be found by cable engineers back on shore. The areas affected by the outage will give key clues as to what part of the cable is broken.

To get a more precise location, cable engineers can send light pulses along the fibres in the cable using a device known as a Optical Time Domain Reflectometer. When the pulses hit the broken part of the cable they will bounce back and by measuring the time it takes for them to return, engineers can ascertain the location of the damage to within tens of metres.

The next stage is to employ a specially fitted cable ship, which will have onboard remotely operated vehicles (ROVs).

**Fishing**

If the ROV is able to locate the cable it can cut out the non-working sections and pull the cable back onto the ship. Alternatively a device onboard known as a grapnel can hook the cable from the sea floor and drag it on to the ship.

""The first option is preferable because it means you can recover the cable very close to the end whereas a grapnel is less precise,"" said Mr Harper.

The damaged cable can be repaired on the ship at which point a technician will splice new cable to the existing pieces. Once repaired it can be lowered back to the seabed.

Two cable operators were involved in this most recent outage.

There was disruption to 70% of the nationwide network in Egypt, and India suffered up to 60% disruption. Disruption also occurred in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

In December 2006, seven of the eight cables connected to Taiwan were damaged by an earthquake, disrupting communications in much of Asia. These cables took several months to fully repair. Natural disasters are one of several causes of cable outages. In this case, an errant anchor has been blamed and Mr Harper believes there is ""still a partial conflict between the needs of shipping and of telecoms"". But it is not the biggest problem facing cable operators.

""Fishing is still the biggest issue. Historically in Europe trawler fishing has been a problem although in the last 15 years most cables have been buried in the seabed to overcome this.""","The article titled ""Work begins to repair severed net"" from BBC News discusses the repair of two damaged internet cables in the Mediterranean Sea that were severed.

"The Hidden World of Undersea Fiber","Explores the causes of undersea fiber cable cuts, detailing incidents like Superstorm Sandy that disrupted global communication; discusses the impact of natural disasters and human activities.","https://circleid.com/posts/20190925_the_hidden_world_of_undersea_fiber","","By Doug Dawson",Yes,"Doug Dawson","Scottsdale, Arizona, United States","3764","2019-09-25","English","CircleID","Since the first undersea cable was completed in 1858 to deliver telegraph messages between the US and England, we’ve had an extensive network of undersea cable networks that enable communications between continents.

Earlier this year there were 378 undersea fiber cables in place that stretch over 745,000 miles. Here’s an [interactive map](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/) that shows all of the cables and also allows highlighting of individual cables.

What’s most intriguing about the map is that there are a few cities around the world where numerous cables terminate. One such place is New York City, and Superstorm Sandy cut the connections of several fibers, and the connection between the US and Europe went dark for a few hours. The companies building the cables are now considering diversifying the terminal locations of the fiber cables.

Cables also routinely get cut from other events such as earthquakes, underwater mudslides, ship anchors, and even a tiny number from sharks. There is an average of about 25 underseas fiber cuts per year. Repairs are made by ships that pull the cut ends of the fiber to the surface and splice the ends back together. There have been a few fiber cuts where there was suspicion of sabotage, but it’s never been proven. There is no real way to provide security for undersea cables, and the routes of the cables are well known. It’s been a poorly kept secret that spy agencies around the world tap into various cables to monitor traffic.

Undersea fibers are made differently than other fiber. Since the biggest danger from fiber cuts is in shallow water, the cable for shallow locations is as thick as a coke can and is routinely buried under the surface. At deeper depths below 8,000 feet, where the dangers of fiber cuts are minimal, the cables are only as thick as a magic marker. There are cables laid as deep as 25,000 feet below the surface. One unusual aspect of underseas fibers is the use of an underlying copper layer that is used to transmit the electricity needed to power fiber repeaters along the long underseas paths. The cables can be powered with as much as 10,000 volts to force the power along the longest Pacific routes.

The undersea fiber paths carry over 99% of the traffic between continents, with the small remainder carried by satellites. Satellites are never expected to carry more than a tiny fraction of the traffic due to the gigantic, and constantly growing volume of worldwide data traffic. The FCC estimated that only 0.37% of the US international data traffic is carried by satellite. The capacity of the newer cables is mind-boggling—the Marea cable that was completed between Spain and Virginia in 2018 has a capacity of 208 terabits per second. No satellite network is ever going to be able to carry more than a tiny fraction of that kind of capacity. Worldwide bandwidth usage is exploding as the users on the Internet continues to grow (there were 1 million new users added to the Web every day in 2018). And just like in the US, usage per person is growing everywhere at an exponential rate.

One thing that is obvious from the fiber map is there are parts of the world or routes that don’t exist. The companies that fund the cables build them to satisfy existing broadband needs, which is why there are so many cables between places like the US and Europe or between countries in the Mediterranean. There are no routes between places like Australia and South America because there is not enough specific traffic between the two places to justify the cost of a new cable route. While cable routes terminate to India and China, one would expect to see more fibers added in coming years. These two countries are currently seeing the biggest number of new Internet users (in 2018 there were 100 million new users in India and 80 million new users in China).

The cables have traditionally been built and owned by the world’s biggest telecom companies. But in recent years, companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon have been investing in new undersea fibers. This will allow them to carry their own traffic between continents in the same way they are also now carrying terrestrial traffic.

Undersea cables are designed for a 25-year life, and so cables are regularly being retired and replaced. Many cables aren’t reaching the 25-year life because the built-in repeaters become obsolete and it’s often more profitable to lay a larger capacity newer cable.","The article discusses undersea fiber cables in detail, including the frequency of cuts, causes such as natural disasters and human activities, and the significant impact these cuts have on global communication.

An arrest warrant has been issued for a Newfoundland fishing vessel after another subsea telecommunication cable was broken last summer off the coast of Atlantic Canada.

In a statement of claim filed last week in federal court, Nova Scotia-headquartered Eastlink accuses the vessel Oceans Joy of damaging its cable, costing the company nearly $1 million in repairs.

It was at least the fourth time an underwater cable was snapped by a fishing vessel in the region between May 2013 and July 2014.

Subsea cables are essential pieces of internet and phone infrastructure that connect the globe; however, damage by fishing continues to be a problem. There are roughly 200 cable ""faults"" a year around the world, most of them caused by fishing gear and anchors, according to Doug Burnett, a New York-based cable law expert.

Century-old Maritime law allows cable companies to make claims against those vessel owners. ""It's an important one. Not only to recover the cost of repair, but really to act as a deterrent,"" says Burnett.

But fishermen also have recourse if they accidentally snag a subsea cable. If the crew cuts the trawl or anchor to preserve the cable, the vessel owner is entitled to compensation from the cable company.

In this case, Eastlink says on July 17, 2014, its network operation centre detected the loss of ""optic signal"" between Rose Blanche, N.L., and Sydney, N.S. A segment of its Persona cable made up of 24 optic fibres sheathed in armor was completely severed.

The break was fixed by International Telecom, a cable repair company out of Halifax. Eastlink says the total cost was $972,696.72, according to its statement of claim.

A week after the break, Eastlink says it was contacted by John Wayne Coleman, the owner of the Oceans Joy, who told the company his fishing gear had contacted the cable. Eastlink alleges negligence on the part of the vessel's owner, master, and crew.

According to the accompanying Notice to Mariners, vessels are to avoid anchoring in cable lanes which appear on any nautical chart. Eastlink states that service for customers was not disrupted and this case is one of several cable damage claims that have ended up in court recently.","The article discusses the damage caused by a Newfoundland fishing vessel to a subsea telecommunication cable, highlighting the incident's significance in the context of global cable faults caused by fishing activities.

Several links on the Eastern Africa Submarine System (EASSy) have been offline since Tuesday due to shunt fault, MyBroadband has learned.

An industry source with knowledge of the situation explained that traffic to the Middle East and Central and Eastern Europe was the most affected and seeing increased latency.

However, unlike the incidents earlier this year, the fault does not appear to have caused major disruptions to the continent’s Internet.

EASSy is a 10,000 km submarine cable system along the east coast of Africa, with nine landing stations in Sudan, Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Comoros, Madagascar, Mozambique and South Africa.

It is a consortium cable owned by several telecommunications companies, including WIOCC, MTN’s Bayobab, Vodacom DRC, Liquid Intelligent Technologies, and Telkom.

WIOCC is the largest shareholder in the EASSy consortium.

According to TeleGeography, the other owners are BT, Bharti Airtel, Botswana Fibre Networks, Comores Telecom, Djibouti Telecom, Etisalat UAE, Mauritius Telecom, Orange, Saudi Telecom, Sudatel, Tanzania Telecommunication Corporation, Telkom Kenya, Telma, and Zambia Telecom.

A shunt fault is a type of power feed problem that occurs when the insulation protecting a submarine cable becomes damaged.

These cables use underwater amplifiers to boost the light signal propagating along their fibre optic strands, which require power.

Power is fed from either end of the cable and flows along a metallic outer core that surrounds the optical fibre.

These cores — the fibreglass and conductor — are wrapped in insulation and protected using a strong material like Kevlar.

However, damage can still occur from ship anchors, fishing trawlers, backhoe dredgers, powerful ocean currents dragging the cable, or even sea creatures like sharks.

When the insulation becomes damaged, it can create a short circuit from the cable’s metallic core to the seawater, causing a shunt fault.

A WIOCC spokesperson told MyBroadband that the cause of the cable break is currently unknown.","The article titled ""Another Internet Cable Fault Hits South Africa"" discusses a fault in the Eastern Africa Submarine System (EASSy), which is a submarine cable system.

by William Furey and Patrick McSherry  
  
The cutting of the cables at Cienfuegos was one of the most remarkable events of the Spanish American War. In the face of severe fire, a group of men raised the cables through which communications passed between Cuba and the outside world.  
  
**Background:**  
The USS Marblehead was built by City Works in Boston, Massachusetts, being launched August 11, 1892. During the Spanish American War, the cruiser steamed from Key West, Florida, for war patrol duty in Cuba, under the command of Captain McCalla. The vessel arrived off Havana on April 23, 1898. Two weeks later, at Cienfuegos, she shelled enemy vessels and fortifications while her crewmen and that of the Nashville cut the communications cables.  
  
On May 11, 1898, near the lighthouse at the entrance of Cienfuegos Harbor, the Marblehead located the telegraph cables leading from the south and west into the cable house, that were used as communication between Cienfuegos, Havana and Spain.  
  
Commanding officer McCalla, of the Marblehead, prepared to cut the cables. Volunteers were requested to go on a landing party to drag the ocean floor to locate and then raise the cables. Once raised, the cables would be physically cut.  
  
Lt. Cameron McR. Winslow was placed in charge of the steam and sailing launches from the USS Nashville and the Marblehead with Lt. Anderson, 2nd in command. Ensign Magruder, of the Nashville, commanded a steam launch that dropped the sailing launches opposite the Cable House, took position of 150 to 200 yards off shore and gave covering fire. The two main cables were cut but because of intense gunfire from the enemy, an attempt to cut a third smaller cable found on shore had to be abandoned.  
  
During the fire fight, the lighthouse was destroyed as the Spanish troops, hidden in gullies and ravines, rained a hail of bullets onto the cable cutting party, resulting in many casualties, including three deaths. Of the men who took part, forty-nine received the Congressional Medal of Honor.

Internet speed slowed down by 60% in several countries including Pakistan.

**KARACHI:** A fiber optic cable got cut in the Arabian Sea near Karachi resulting in nearly 60 percent decrease in internet speed across Pakistan on Wednesday.  

Nearly 50 percent of Pakistan's internet traffic faces disruption as SMW4 - one of the four undersea cables that connects the country with internet was damaged.  

The disruption occurred around 12pm on Wednesday. The country's internet traffic is currently running on two cables instead of four.  

SMW is also referred to as SEA-ME-WE (South East Asia Middle East and Western Europe).  

PTCL and Transworld - the internet gateways for Pakistan - provide internet using this fiber optic cable.  

This is the second submarine cable that has been affected after IMWE which was cut more than a week ago.

Undersea sub-cables have just broken...**

Breaking news: something’s happening to the internet, right now. We’re just not quite sure what.

Interoute, the internet networks company, reports that three of the four internet sub-cables that run from Asia to North America have been damaged.

These carry more than 75 percent of traffic between the Middle East, Europe, and America. It’s hard to gather what this actually means – is it that the internet is down or (more likely) significantly slower than usual between the Middle East and America? (If you’re reading this, let’s face it, the internet has not shut down altogether)

But, according to the company, there is a domino effect taking place. Interoute says it is:

> hearing that offices have lost their entire private network connectivity. As a result, users are unable to do their daily job over the internet and are turning to their mobile phones to communicate across the globe. This is having a knock on effect on the domestic voice networks, which are getting a surge of calls needing to be routed internationally. These calls need to be routed onto international gateways that pass voice traffic in longer directions around the world to avoid the cable breaks – causing more quality issues and risk more call failures, in turn causing more calls to be placed and increasing the pressure on local voice networks.

> What (I think) this means is that companies’ private internet services have gone down. So, if they can get access, they have had to go on the public internet and mobile phones, like the rest of us average joes, to get their work done. That results in more strain on mobile phone networks, which means more phone calls go down and the internet becomes slower.

Here’s the big problem right now:

> Finance companies [are] looking to settle trades on European and American exchanges. This cable outage means there is no real-time access to, for example, trading ticker services. This means branch offices are compromised when trying to place trades. As private networks are being affected, these organisations are forced to rely on public internet services that may have more latency and may not update as quickly. The loss of time even precious seconds is hugely important to trading exchanges. These public internet services are now struggling to cope with peak in demand – leading to increased latency, and further compromising the integrity of the trading data.

I’m told that these major sub-sea cables break once a year. So companies have developed a fall-back plan. If one sub-sea cable is out, traffic is re-routed onto a second cable. In theory, a dual break, where both cables go out at once, is incredibly rare. Prior to January this year, it had not happened before.

The problem with all of this is that it’s hard to see the impact, or its significance, until something disastrous happens. So, we’re keeping an eye on it and like we said, er, something’s happening to the internet.","The article provides a comprehensive discussion on the recent damage to undersea sub-cables, detailing specific incidents, their causes, and the significant impact on internet connectivity and communication.

**Undersea cables’ vulnerability: A hidden network of vital connectivity**

The strategic importance of cables, pipelines and other critical subsea infrastructure is underlined by recent sabotages in a context of hybrid warfare.

Over the last months, the war in Ukraine and the numerous implications it has brought about in the field of grey-zone warfare have come to show the fragile situation of undersea cables, gas pipelines and critical subsea infrastructure in general. Just a month after the sabotage which took place in the Baltic with the explosion at the Nord Stream pipelines, several cuts were reported simultaneously, in late October 2022, at the Faroe and Shetlands Islands (North Atlantic), and at the south of France near Marseille.

The strategic importance of subsea cables is quite significant given the amount of information and digital transactions which run through them each day while they still remain notably unprotected. For years, many analysts have underestimated such importance; and only during recent times has the issue become central to maritime security discussions. Among some of the early advocates on the importance of critical seabed infrastructure we find current UK Prime Minister (back then a Member of Parliament), Rishi Sunak, who prepared a report back in 2017 on the vital importance of these infrastructures. In it, he pointed out to the fact that “there is no alternative to using these undersea cables”, which in just a single day “carry some $10 trillion of financial transfers and process some 15 million financial transactions”. Despite their criticality for global telecommunications, subsea cables remain largely unprotected. The vulnerability already mentioned is further compounded by the fact that their location is available to the general public.

In most cases, the cables laid down in offshore areas are buried in the seabed to prevent them from getting damaged easily with the ships’ anchors or the fishing nets. However, as recent events have demonstrated, these safety measures aren’t enough to prevent incidents from taking place. Thus, in the face of such irony, what is the current scenario regarding undersea critical infrastructure and its importance for maritime security in general? How could it be further protected in order to avoid major disasters from happening?

**Incidents**

As mentioned above, during late October 2022, several undersea cables at both the Faroe Islands (of Danish sovereignty) and the Shetlands Islands (a British territory), and in the Southern France’s Mediterranean waters were simultaneously damaged. The former incident left a great part of the islands’ population without any access to the Internet, while, in the latter, which happened on October 19th, at least three key fiber optic cables connecting Marseille to Lyon, Barcelona and Milan were also cut. It is noteworthy that Marseille, a hub connecting the European, Asian and African continents, is among the most critical locations for cable communications infrastructures in the Mediterranean, with a total of 13 cables reaching it.

Immediately after these simultaneous incidents took place, there were mixed viewpoints as to what the causes might have been. Páll Vesturbú, head of Infrastructure for Faroese Telecom, pointed to fishing activity as the most likely cause of the incident: “We expect it will be fishing vessels that damaged the cable, but it is very rare that we have two problems at the same time.” And while this may be a plausible explanation, there are people who feel even more skeptical to the possibility of these events happening by accident. Hans Tino Hansen, the CEO of Risk Intelligence, suggested that “the probability of this happening once by mistake is low and the probability of this happening twice is insignificant and non-existent for a third and fourth time when measured against normal trawler behavior.”

The cybersecurity company Zscaler, which had its services interrupted as a result of the incident in Marseille, published a report soon after it took place. In it, the company detailed how it was “aware of a major cable cut in the South of France that has impacted major cables with connectivity to Asia, Europe, US and potentially other parts of the world.” The report also confirmed that the interruption had affected links between Marseille and Lyon, Milan and Barcelona.

Marseille is known for being a key node linking home to 13 undersea cables connecting the European, Asian and African continents. The incident shows how, as it has already been stated, these cables and underwater infrastructure are, in most cases, notably unprotected against threats and sabotage. In the case of the recent events in the region, initial investigations carried out by the French authorities suggested they could well be a case of sabotage.

In a parallel case, as Justin Shermann, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Cyber Statecraft Initiative, has pointed out, one of the initial steps taken by Russia in 2014 when they invaded the Crimean Peninsula was to damage one of the undersea cables linking the peninsula to the Ukrainian mainland. Thus, both with the Nord Stream incident and the recent events in the Shetlands and the Mediterranean, Russian activity has received much attention as the potential responsible behind. Nevertheless, nothing has conclusively been proven yet.

**Efforts by France, NATO and the UK**

In this context of exposure of undersea cables, prior to the incident, France had already boosted their surveillance around its undersea infrastructures prior to the incident, as announced in mid-October, when President Emmanuel Macron publicly unveiled the purchase of a deep-sea drone and a robot to be used against these kinds of attacks. The initiative is part of a military program of the French government expected to be deployed by 2025, with the robots able to reach depths of 6,000 meters. Yet, having such a fleet of drones to boost surveillance doesn’t ensure sufficient protection, especially for a country like France, given the vast number of cables it has extended along the seabed. With around 30 cables coming into its territory, and the wide range of techniques available to damage these infrastructures, the task is of considerable difficulty. Cyrille Dalmont, a researcher at the Institut Thomas Moore Institute, suggests a plausible way to make sabotages harder is to increase the number of operational cables. According to him, the only real defense would be “to lay down further cable lines”, so that a concrete act of sabotage can’t result in a blackout.

In early 2023, NATO defense ministers announced a plan to strengthen undersea infrastructure and prevent incidents like the one happening with the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines. Their explosion, confirmed as a sabotage with explosives, is yet another example of critical undersea infrastructure that remains vulnerable to hostile intentions at the same time as being easily disrupted. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced the establishment of a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell at NATO. Led by German Lieutenant General Hans-Werner Wiermann, this center represents a positive initiative and starting point for the Alliance to keep building on; the face of the challenge Russia or China could pose if restoring to the disruption of allied undersea critical infrastructure. Protecting their extensive network of undersea critical infrastructure is among the top priorities for the French government. Having the second largest maritime area in the world, France is particularly concerned about the fact that only two of its robots are able to dive below 2,000 meters. This leaves many cables in a vulnerable position against hybrid attacks.","The article titled ""Undersea cables’ vulnerability: A hidden network of vital connectivity"" discusses the critical importance and vulnerability of undersea cables, particularly in the context of recent incidents of sabotage and damage.

It's also a physical system of wires that stretch every which way, some of which travel under the ocean. That's a point of weakness as recently illustrated when three of these cables were cut by a poorly-dropped anchor. Not for the first time, and probably not for the last.

The affected cables run along the seabed in the English Channel and serve the Channel Islands. According to the BBC, the two companies that jointly own the cables have taken to fixing it, but the process could take up to three weeks.

It would take a whole lot of bad luck to drop anchor directly on top of a submarine cable on three separate occasions, so the more likely explanation is that the ship was dragging its anchor along the channel's floor, scraping an off-limits area where multiple cables run. There is still a connection left, but it requires all data from the islands to be pushed through a single cable that routes everything through France, which is leaving folks on the affected islands dealing with serious slowdowns.

This isn't the first time this has happened. In 2008, a ship dropped anchor and severed a cable to Dubai that left 75 million people in the city and greater region with limited internet access. In 2012, a similar blunder had ramifications in a number of countries. It's not even the first time this has happened in the English Channel, as the BBC notes. An anchor sliced up some cables there back in January of this year.

Fortunately this incident is only messing up internet connectivity for a relatively small amount of people and isn't cutting off access completely, but it's increasingly clear that anchors and submarine internet cables just do not get along and that warning boats where not to drop anchor isn't a completely effective solution. Hopefully we can come up with something more fool-proof before someone slices through a bunch of truly crucial cables.","The article 'Ship's Anchor Slices Through Three Undersea Internet Cables' directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables by detailing an incident where three undersea cables were severed by a dropped anchor.

It discusses the implications for internet connectivity in the Channel Islands, indicating that the incident has caused significant slowdowns due to reliance on a single remaining cable.

The article provides historical context by referencing past similar incidents, thus treating the subject as a central theme rather than a minor mention.

This aligns well with the criterion for being on the topic of cut sea cables."

It is like Groundhog Day! Once again an undersea cable has been cut — the South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 4 (aka SEA-ME-WE 4) cable, and that is causing an internet (and communications) slowdown in and around Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The cut was said to be near Alexandria in Egypt. Tata Communications administers the network.  
While the cut was on a single cable, it came at an unfortunate time as a few other major cables were in “maintenance mode” and that has resulted in problems for service providers across the region. Our sources in the telecom community confirmed that two other cables — Europe India Gateway (EIG) and India-Middle East-Western Europe (IMEWE) — were in ‘maintenance’ mode when the SWM4 got cut. The result is downstream congestion on networks that are going to India and around the Indian Ocean. UAE’s Etisalat reported that internet speeds were down by as much as 60 percent in some locations.  
Sunil Tagare, who runs the BuySellBandwidth.com, on his blog wrote:  
> It’s not good enough to say since you have 10 cables even if going through Egypt, you have route diversity. And as today’s 4 cable cuts have demonstrated, any time the cables are along similar paths, there is a high likelihood that all of them might be cut at the same time.  
He was arguing that four major cables were impacted at the same time causing problems in the Middle East and Asia. It is not a smart way to think about the networks, especially since we depend so heavily on many of these optical cables. Tagare’s argument makes sense, for we have seen this pattern repeat itself a few times.  
In 2010, the SEA-ME-WE-4 experienced a cut causing large scale disruptions, two years after the cable experienced an outage. Things have become more acute now considering that SEA-ME-WE4 is a lifeline for the African internet. SEACOM, an African consortium which owns the big African Internet cable, later confirmed the outage on its website and said that it was working towards restoration. Mark Simpson, CEO of SEACOM, stated:  
> The cause of the outage is a physical cable cut some kilometres north of the coast of Egypt in the Mediterranean Sea. This is not likely to be known until the cable is repaired in the coming week or two and the damaged section is recovered from the seabed and inspected. However, we suspect that the most likely cause is external aggression to the cable, probably caused by a larger vessel dragging its anchor across the sea bed.  
By the way, SEAMEWE-3 experienced a cut about two months ago (between Singapore and Perth, Australia) and it hasn’t been fixed just yet mostly because the network operator was waiting for Indonesian government permission to fix the cable which is in Indonesian waters.","The article titled 'Undersea cable cut near Egypt slows down Internet in Africa, Middle East, South Asia' provides a comprehensive discussion on the topic of cut sea cables.

Today, 99 percent of our transoceanic data traffic—including phone calls, text and e-mail messages, Web sites, digital images and video, and even some television—travels across the oceans via undersea cables. These cable systems, as opposed to satellites, carry most of the intercontinental Internet traffic. In her new book, _The Undersea Network_, New York University assistant professor of media, culture and communication Nicole Starosielski tracks submarine systems as they thread together small islands and major urban hubs, conflicts at coastal landing points, and Cold-War–era cable stations.

In this excerpt Starosielski visits the network operations centers where global cable systems are monitored and maintained by a small group of elite engineers.

**Gateway: From Cable Colony to Network Operations Center**  
Entering the network operations center of a globe-spanning undersea cable system, I find what you might expect: a room dominated by computer screens, endless information feeds of network activity, and men carefully monitoring the links that carry Internet traffic in and out of the country. At first glance, it seems to be a place of mere supervision, where the humans sit around and watch machines do the work of international connection, waiting only for a moment of crisis, such as when a local fishing boat drops an anchor on the cable or a tsunami sweeps the system down into a trench.

This vision of autonomous networks is shaped more by Hollywood cinema than by actual cable operations. In reality, our global cable network is always in a sort of crisis and, at the same time, highly dependent on humans to power the steady flow of information transmissions.

It would perhaps be more precise to say that cables are always in a state of “alarm.” An “alarm,” in network-speak, is anything from an indication that the cable has been severed to a reminder about a needed computer update. Undersea systems are not so different from our personal computers. They need regular updates and upgrades. They are susceptible to bugs and environmental fluctuations. Sometimes things just don’t work as planned. The men in a network operations center work daily to resolve a continually updated batch of alarms, which at this particular location number around 120–150 per week. The vast majority of these are only warning alarms, which notify them of some approaching threshold, a problem with a backup system, or a source of potential interference. Even if our signals continue to pass through cable systems without delay, the undersea network never quite functions perfectly on its own, that is, without alarm and without human assistance.

System errors can be produced by even the smallest events. The stations where undersea links terminate house immense cooling systems, and with all of the air conditioners blowing dust around, regular cleaning is required. Yet even when companies employ specialized cleaning crews, there is often an increased number of alarms during the process. By contrast, during Christmas the number drops dramatically. An operations manager explains what might seem obvious: “when you haven’t got people touching stuff it tends not to break.” The inside of his station testifies to the danger of human hands. The primary fibers running in from the sea are labeled with bright tape reading “Danger Optical Fiber,” to warn anyone who enters the station not to touch them. During Super Bowl weekend, another company planned not to have any activity in their station at all, just to ensure that nothing went wrong. The circulation of human bodies, necessary for network operation, inevitably bump, jostle, and set equipment into an alarm state.

Alarms can also be generated by the machines themselves. Although network equipment is supposed to be identical and thus predictable, in reality each device displays remarkably individual behavior and can produce errors without anyone even coming into contact with it. One manager gripes to me that their station just hadn’t gotten the right piece of transmission equipment, and once it had started to have bugs, it required repeated maintenance for most of its life—a kind of problem child. Another cable engineer explains that each machine has been manufactured using different batches of raw materials and assembled at different times. Two circuit packs might be technically identical but might function differently over the course of their lifetime, in part because different computers contain materially different components. The glass or the solder wire may have been of a different quality or come from a different origin. This can result in “batch faults” which occur in a series of equipment manufactured at the same time. The engineer uses an analogy to explain the process: “It’s a bit like making a fruit cake. I can make a fruit cake on Monday and I can make one on Wednesday, but they can be different even if I followed the same recipe. In the one on Monday I might have used 198 grams of sugar and the one on Wednesday I might have had 205 grams of sugar. Very, very minor differences could have an unknown impact sometime in the future.”

The men at this network operations center are tasked with reading the incessant feed of alarms, determining what needs to be fixed, and conducting the necessary maintenance, all without a drop in signal transmission. One technician lets me follow him to a cable station on a routine follow-up to a warning alarm. He explains that there is not a one-to-one correspondence between each alarm and an actual problem with the system. Rather, an alarm is a symptom that something is wrong—an indication of a failed connection. It could be compared to a fever or a rash on the human body: a manifestation of a problem, but not an indication of cause. A full cable break might generate many alarms. In turn, multiple problems might contribute to a single alarm.

As a result, there is a significant amount of human interpretation required to deduce the origin of a problem from an array of alarms. Cable engineers might be thought of as the doctors of the global cable network. Pointing to one rack, which has a light on, this technician says, “See… that machine is in a state of alarm.” He plugs in his computer to figure out what is wrong, but it remains unclear. He then turns to a rack from which several cords extend, plugging into another machine. He looks at the loose cords. “I think that this one here,” he says, picking up a cord, “is supposed to be in here”—he points to a jack— “but I’m not sure.” He’s not ready to risk it. This alarm is only for a backup machine, so it can wait. We leave the station, still not quite sure what the cause is, and head back to the network operations center to consult with the other technicians.

While in some ways the computers that support global networks are not so different from our personal laptops, the stakes are dramatically higher for this kind of maintenance work. The technicians aim to make every backup system, and backup-for-the-backup system, run perfectly. Much of the equipment is designed to function for 25 years, the expected life of an undersea cable, including the repeaters that sit on the bottom of the seafloor. These are some of the most durable computers out there. And yet some parts will develop bugs, and others won’t. Technicians keep detailed records on individual pieces of equipment so they know what each part’s history is. Tracking “what each one’s been through” is critical to maintaining a reliable network.

Even the smallest discordances in the network need to be addressed. One cable worker describes a problem he had with a piece of equipment that was displaying an alarm state when he looked at it in the landing station, but the alarm was not detected back at the network operations center. As a result, he could not determine where the bug was: in the piece of equipment or in the computers at the center. Even though it was at great cost, the engineer decided to send the equipment out to have its code rewritten, just in case. Even though the alarms are constant, because of this thorough labor, actual failures are few and far between.

Operating undersea networks requires this kind of careful interpretive work and a detailed knowledge of the history of cable equipment, skills that cannot be outsourced to computers. Although we might think of digital networks as purely technical, engineers and technicians are the human components in a system carrying 99 percent of transoceanic Internet traffic. If these workers were to disappear, the system would ultimately collapse. We owe the smooth operation of global communications in part to their ability to act quickly and minimize disruptions.

The level of secrecy of this job, the specialized nature of cabling, and the small number of systems, however, have kept this a fairly insular group of men. Many have been in the cable industry for decades. Even with all of this experience, though, no single person has an understanding of the entire network. In the station that I visited, new servers and stacks have been added, and the technician I interviewed was not familiar with the history of every single one. As a result, engineers depend heavily on each other to solve problems: they must know who to call for what information and how to coordinate system fixes across platforms. The insularity of the cable community supports this interpretive work.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, covering their operational status and the implications of potential damage, including severance.

A robot submarine dispatched by France Telecom has arrived at a location in the Mediterranean Sea where it will locate the ends of two broken cables and bring them to the surface and reconnect them, the BBC reports. A separate ship commissioned by Reliance Communications of India is on its way to repair the third cable, Reuters said. The companies said the work wasn't likely to be completed until the end of the year, a delay that means communications in the Middle East and parts of South Asia could remain spotty.

A submarine robot named Hector is beginning the repairs on the SeaMeWe-3 and SeaMeWe-4, which are cables owned by a consortium of telecommunications companies and operated by France Telecom. A third cable known as FLAG is under separate ownership and operated by a unit of Reliance. The cables were cut within a few minutes of each other, sparking theories that a fishing net or anchor of a single ship cut all three.

Internet communications to the same region took a major hit in January when four underseas cables were seriously damaged in less than a week. The number of failures in such a short period of time stoked conspiracy theories that they were the result of saboteurs, but experts say it's not uncommon to experience multiple breaks in region given the narrowness and shallowness of the route the cables take.

In describing the system of wires that comprises the internet, Neal Stephenson once compared Earth to a computer motherboard. From telephone poles suspending bundles of cable to signs posted warning of buried fiber optic lines, we are surrounded by evidence that at a basic level, the internet is really just a spaghetti-work of really long wires. But what we see is just a small part of the physical makeup of the net. The rest of it can be found in the coldest depths of the ocean. Here are 10 things you might not know about the internet’s system of undersea cables.

More than 95 percent of international data is transmitted by wires at the bottom of the ocean called submarine communications cables. In total, they are hundreds of thousands of miles long and can lie 8000 meters below the surface—as deep as Mount Everest is tall. The cables are installed by special boats called cable-layers. It’s more than a matter of dropping wires with anvils attached to them—the cables must generally be run across flat surfaces of the ocean floor, and care is taken to avoid coral reefs, sunken ships, fish beds, and other ecological habitats and general obstructions.

The diameter of a shallow water cable is about the same as a soda can, while deep water cables are much thinner—about the size of a Magic Marker. The size difference is related to simple vulnerability—there’s not much going on 8000 feet below sea level; consequently, there’s less need for galvanized shielding wire. Cables located at shallow depths are buried beneath the ocean floor using high pressure water jets. Though per-mile prices for installation change depending on total length and destination, running a cable across the ocean invariably costs hundreds of millions of dollars.

There’s disagreement as to why, exactly, sharks occasionally gnaw on submarine communications cables. Maybe it has something to do with electromagnetic fields. Maybe they’re just curious. Maybe they’re trying to disrupt our communications infrastructure before mounting a land-based assault. The point remains that sharks have been discovered chewing on the internet, and they sometimes damage it—but “fish bites” account for less than 1 percent of cable faults in the industry’s history, according to the International Cable Protection Committee. Still, companies such as Google have shielded their cables in shark-proof wrappers.

It seems like every couple of years, some well-meaning construction worker puts his bulldozer in gear and kills Netflix for the whole continent. While the ocean is free of construction equipment that might otherwise combine to form Devastator, there are many ongoing aquatic threats to the submarine cables. Sharks aside, the internet is ever at risk of being disrupted by boat anchors, trawling by fishing vessels, and natural disasters. A Toronto-based company has proposed running a cable through the Arctic that connects Tokyo and London. This was previously considered impossible, but climate change and receding ice have moved the proposal firmly into the doable-but-really-expensive category.

In 1854, installation began on the first transatlantic telegraph cable, which connected Newfoundland and Ireland. Four years later the first transmission was sent, reading: “Laws, Whitehouse received five minutes signal. Coil signals too weak to relay. Try drive slow and regular. I have put intermediate pulley. Reply by coils.” This is, admittedly, not very inspiring. (“Whitehouse” referred to Wildman Whitehouse, the chief electrician of the Atlantic Telegraph Company.)

For historical context: During those four years of cable construction, Charles Dickens was still writing novels; Walt Whitman published Leaves of Grass; a small settlement called Dallas was formally incorporated in Texas; and Abraham Lincoln, candidate for the U.S. Senate, gave his “House Divided” speech.

During the height of the Cold War, the USSR often transmitted weakly encoded messages between two of its major naval bases. Soviet officials thought strong encryption was a bother—and also overkill—because the bases were directly linked by an undersea cable located in sensor-laden Soviet territorial waters. No way would the Americans risk World War III by trying to somehow access and tap that cable.

They didn’t count on the U.S.S. Halibut, a specially fitted submarine capable of slipping by Soviet defenses. The American submarine found the cable and installed a giant wiretap, returning monthly to gather the transmissions it had recorded. This operation, called IVY BELLS, was later compromised by a former NSA analyst named Ronald Pelton, who sold information on the mission to the Soviets. Today, tapping submarine communications cables is standard operating procedure for spy agencies.

With respect to electronic espionage, one big advantage held by the United States is the key role its scientists, engineers, and corporations played in inventing and building large parts of the global telecommunications infrastructure. Major lines of data tend to cross into American borders and territorial waters, making wiretapping a breeze, relatively speaking. When documents stolen by former NSA analyst Edward Snowden came to light, many countries were outraged to learn the extent to which American spy agencies were intercepting foreign data. As a result, some countries are reconsidering the infrastructure of the internet itself. Brazil, for example, launched a project to build a submarine communications cable to Portugal that not only bypassed the United States entirely, but also specifically excludes U.S. companies from involvement.

As of 2022, there were more than 5000 satellites in orbit. We’re landing probes on comets, we’re deflecting asteroids so they don’t collide with Earth, and we’re planning missions to Mars. We’re living in the future! It just seems self-evident that space would be a better way to virtually “wire” the internet than our current method of running really long cables along the ocean floor. Surely satellites would be better than a technology invented before the invention of the telephone—right?

As it turns out, no. Though fiber optic cables and communications satellites were both developed in the 1960s, satellites have a two-fold problem: latency and bit loss. Sending and receiving signals to and from space takes time. Meanwhile, researchers have developed optical fibers that can transmit information at 99.7 percent the speed of light. For an idea of what the internet would be like without undersea cables, visit Antarctica, the only continent without a physical connection to the net. The continent relies on satellites, and bandwidth is at a premium which is no small problem when one considers the important, data-intensive climate research underway. Today, Antarctic research stations produce more data than they can transmit through space.

The good news is that it’s hard to cut through a submarine communications cable due to the thousands of very lethal volts running through each of them. The bad news is that it is possible, as seen in Egypt in 2013.","The article provides extensive information about undersea cables, discussing their importance, threats they face, and specific incidents of damage, including a reference to a cable cut in Egypt in 2013.

"Ship's Anchor Cuts Mideast Internet Cable","Disruption of internet traffic affecting multiple cables, including FALCON, due to a ship's anchor; expert analysis on incident frequency and conspiracy theories.","http://edition.cnn.com/2008/TECH/02/08/internet.outage","","",Yes,-,"New York, NY, USA","50000","2023-02-27","English","CNN","**Firm: Ship's anchor cut Mideast Internet cable**  
(CNN) -- A telecommunications company on Friday blamed a ship anchor for cutting one of three severed undersea cables that snarled Internet traffic throughout the Middle East last week.  
FLAG Telecom blamed the slicing of its Persian Gulf cable on this abandoned six-ton ship anchor.  
FLAG Telecom's FALCON cable spanning Dubai and Oman was snapped February 1 by an abandoned six-ton ship anchor, the company said, and will be repaired by Sunday.  
The cut cables linking the Mideast not only fouled up communications, but they also provided prime fodder for Web-based conspiracy theorists around the world.  
""Fundamentally, if somebody wants to cut a cable, they can do so -- all you need to do is go trawling with an anchor,"" said Stephan Beckert an analyst with TeleGeography, a research company that consults on global Internet issues. He scoffed at conspiracy theories posted online by what he calls ""the tin-foil hat crowd.""  
FLAG said Friday that its severed Europe-Asia Internet cable in the Mediterranean Sea that links Egypt and Italy also would be repaired by Sunday.  
A third cut cable, called SeaMeWe-4, lies just a few hundred meters from FLAG's Europe-Asia line. It's co-owned by France Telecom and is expected to be back in working order soon, said Beckert.  
The question is, who would have incentive to cut underwater Internet cables? That wild speculation, Beckert said, ""just doesn't make a lot of sense.""  
Theories that the U.S. government was behind the cable cuts to create an information blackout for whatever reason are ridiculous, Beckert said.  
""The U.S. military uses those cables,"" he said, ""they would find it quite inconvenient,"" although Beckert added that the military also uses satellites to run communication traffic as a secondary route.  
Another target of the Internet sabotage speculation is Islamic terrorists. ""It was a six-ton anchor that took out that cable in the Persian Gulf. Unless al Qaeda has extremely strong frogmen or submarines, I'm not sure how they did it,"" laughed Beckert.  
Scores of cut undersea cables are reported each year, Beckert said, acknowledging that three cables leading into the volatile Middle East would attract more attention.  
A fourth cable, known as the Qatar-UAE Submarine Cable System, which links United Arab Emirates to Qatar went down last weekend, but that failure was blamed on a power outage, Beckert said. Like most cable outages, the incident went largely unnoticed by end users because Internet traffic can easily be re-routed through other cables, he said.  
As the world's fleet of 28 multimillion-dollar cable repair ships works to maintain the crisscrossing communications spider web, Beckert said more capacity is needed in the Persian Gulf to satisfy increasing numbers of Internet users.  
Some undersea Internet cables can cost $500 million to lay, Beckert said, although the expense is shrinking. It still takes a lot of time to stretch communication lines thousands of miles across entire oceans.  
Following last week's outages, Internet Service Providers in India were alerting customers to service slowdowns of 50 percent to 60 percent, according to the Internet Services Providers Association of India. Service was back to normal by this week.  
Although last week's problem created a ""big pain"" for many of carriers, Beckert said, it didn't compare to the several months of disruption in East Asia in 2006 after an earthquake damaged seven undersea cables near Taiwan.  
TeleGeography analysts said a similar Internet problem could not happen in the United States because most traffic between the United States, Canada and Mexico is carried over land, and there is a plentiful supply of undersea cables carrying traffic under the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.","The article titled 'Firm: Ship's anchor cut Mideast Internet cable' provides a detailed account of incidents involving cut undersea cables, specifically mentioning the FALCON cable and two others in the Middle East.

It discusses the cause of these cuts, attributed to a ship anchor, and the resulting disruptions to internet traffic.

The article includes insights from an analyst who discusses the frequency of such incidents and dismisses conspiracy theories about intentional sabotage.

A subsea cable that’s about to be decommissioned is now the only fully functional pathway that connects Vietnam’s internet with the rest of the world.

Out of the five subsea cables that connect Vietnam with the rest of the globe, the SMW-3 has been around the longest. Expecting to be decommissioned in 2024, the soon-to-retire cable is now the only fully operational pathway that holds Vietnam’s international internet connection together for 70 million users.

This is the second time in the last 24 years of operation that the SMW-3 has found itself in the same situation. The first time was in 2007 when one of Vietnam’s two cables at the time was surreptitiously sabotaged. And this time, four out of the five available cables encountered issues all at once.

The problem is not solely because the cables are not working properly. It's also because of the sheer number of internet users and their ever-rising demands for internet access. Some 16 years ago, there were only around 17.7 million internet users in Vietnam. Today, that number has already quadrupled.

Over the past three months, the four cables have encountered issues one after another, partially or fully disabling internet connections running through them.

The first one to have trouble was the AAE-1, which lost the data flow en-route towards Hong Kong on November 24 last year. Seventeen days later, the AAG completely lost all signals. The APG, the cable carrying the most bandwidths, lost signals running towards Malaysia and Singapore on January 21. A week after, the IA lost its connection with Singapore.

No matter what happens, the SMW-3 will be abandoned after 25 years of operation as planned. ""Poor old SMW3 (Ready For Service in 1999, about to be decommissioned) is bearing Vietnam's international traffic alone,"" tweeted an observer of global submarine cable systems developments.

Vu Nhat An, the tech director of a startup in Hanoi, expressed frustration with sluggish and unstable internet access. Users have been reporting slower internet connections than usual, attributing it to damaged cables.

The Vietnam Internet Association noted that internet connections to the outside world might need to take longer trips due to the damaged cables, leading to unstable and slow internet quality for the next few weeks.

Vietnam's internet speed was once a bright spot globally, but the current issues highlight the lack of capacity to adapt to emergencies. The country has worked to increase its internet infrastructure, yet cable damage remains a significant challenge, especially in the active maritime region of the South China Sea.

With five cables currently available, Vietnam utilizes only 1% of all the cables on the globe, yet the issues they encounter account for 10% of all cable issues worldwide. The reparation process is often slow due to the cables being managed by international consortiums.

Vietnam's internet infrastructure has not kept pace with the exponential growth in users, leading to calls for better solutions and more cables to ensure reliable connectivity.","The article discusses Vietnam's internet infrastructure, specifically focusing on the issues surrounding subsea cables.

It mentions that four out of five cables connecting Vietnam faced problems, leading to significant disruptions in internet service.

Specific incidents are detailed, such as the AAE-1 losing data flow on November 24 and the AAG completely losing signals shortly thereafter.

The article explains the implications of these cable issues, describing the frustrations of users and the impact on businesses, emphasizing that the internet issues are due to damaged cables and the inability to quickly repair them.

It centers on the significance of subsea cables in maintaining Vietnam's internet connectivity and discusses the consequences of their failure on communication and internet access.

Thus, the article meets the criterion for being on the topic of cut sea cables."
"Update on Asian Undersea Cable Disruption","Disruption in APCN2 causing 30% slowdown in internet traffic between China and Taiwan, affecting connectivity for millions in Southeast Asia.","https://www.computerworld.com/article/2526855/update--asian-undersea-cable-disruption-slows-internet-access.html","","Sumner Lemon",Yes,"Sumner Lemon","Framingham, Massachusetts, United States","150000","2023-02-06","English","Computerworld","A segment of the Asia-Pacific Cable Network 2 (APCN2) undersea cable network between China and Taiwan suffered a serious cable fault on Wednesday, causing Internet traffic to be rerouted onto other undersea cables and slowing Internet access for some users in Southeast Asia.

At about 10:50 a.m. on Wednesday, local time, an alarm signaled a cable fault on Segment 7 of APCN2, which connects Hong Kong and Shantou, China. The disruption caused a temporary loss of service on the undersea link but all customers that use the cable were soon shifted to capacity on other cables, according to a source familiar with the situation.

The APCN2 cable is owned by a consortium of 26 telecom operators from 14 different countries. The cable links Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, South Korea and Japan.

The exact cause of the APCN2 fault was not immediately known. The alarm indicated the disruption was caused by a ""single point of failure,"" which suggests a variety of possibilities, including a technical failure or a cable cut, the source said.

The incident was likely the main reason that Internet access appeared slower for some users in Singapore on Wednesday, the source said.

Undersea cables are used to transport much of the world's Internet traffic and can be easily damaged by natural disasters or other causes. In 2006, a powerful earthquake off the southern coast of Taiwan damaged several cables and slowed Internet access to a crawl for users in Southeast Asia.

Singapore Telecommunications (SingTel), which is an investor in APCN2, said its users may experience slower Internet access than normal to some U.S. Web sites, blaming the APCN2 fault on damage caused by Typhoon Morakot.

""The [APCN2] consortium members have started restoration works, and our engineers are in the process of diverting Internet traffic to other cable systems. We expect the situation to return to acceptable levels within the next 24 hours,"" SingTel spokesman Chia Boon Chong, said in an e-mail statement.

The fault that hit APCN2 on Wednesday follows two other service disruptions that recently hit the network. One disruption affected APCN2 Segment 7, between Hong Kong and Taiwan, and the other affected APCN2 Segment 1, which connects Singapore and Malaysia. However, both of these disruptions were deemed to be ""relatively minor"" compared to the disruption that took place Wednesday morning, the source said.

APCN2 isn't the only Asian undersea cable currently suffering from a service disruption. ""The Cable & Wireless Real Time Operations Team have logged multiple cable breaks on APCN2, APCN, EAC and SMW3 in Asia Pacific -- specifically, near Taiwan. Network traffic flow has been adversely affected in and out of the region as a result,"" said Gavin Tait, director of Asia network planning and implementation at Cable & Wireless, in an e-mail statement provided by the company.

Efforts are currently underway to repair the East Asia Crossing (EAC) undersea cable after it experienced ""double faults"" off the coast of Taiwan last weekend, according to Roland Lim, a spokesman for Pacnet, which owns EAC.

The first sign of damage to the EAC cable off the coast of Taiwan came on Aug. 9 at 1:37 a.m., local time, when an alarm signalled that service on EAC Segment D, which links Taiwan and Hong Kong, had been disrupted, Pacnet said in an Aug. 10 Network Event Notification that was obtained by IDG News Service. At the time, traffic on Segment D was transferred to EAC Segment C. However, Segment C suffered a second disruption roughly twelve hours later.

The cause of the faults that hit the EAC cable between Hong Kong and Taiwan is not yet known, but the damage happened at about the same time the southern part of the island and China's southern coast was being pummeled by one of the most powerful typhoons to strike in recent memory.","The article discusses a significant disruption in the Asia-Pacific Cable Network 2 (APCN2), specifically mentioning a cable fault that affected internet traffic between China and Taiwan.

UPDATE ON UNDERWATER SALVAGE DIVING EXPEDITION TO RECOVER A PIECE OF VERY EARLY SUBMARINE TELEGRAPH CABLE

I have always been fascinated by the early transatlantic telegraph cables which linked Europe and the United States beginning in 1858. For a number of years I have been interested in trying to locate and recover some of these very early cables from the depths of the Atlantic ocean. This is a report on this year's expedition.

I chartered a TICON 34 sailboat and invited my friend George Ward to join me. The cable section I chose to collect was located about 11 miles off the coast, one of the cables laid between the United States and Havana, Cuba during 1866 to the early 1900s.

Several telegraph key collectors suggested I would probably cut an active cable, but I concluded that I did not cut an active cable.

As I put on my diving gear, I clipped on a hacksaw with a carbide blade to cut into the steel casing. The cable was heavily covered with coral and starting to disintegrate and rust. I used up all 3300 lbs of air in my tank during only 29 minutes of cutting twice through the cable.

I got a little greedy and took a pretty big piece. I had to use air-filled lift bags to help me get the heavy cable to the surface.

I cut the cable into shorter pieces and planned to use a sodium bicarbonate electrolyte solution for stabilization. After 4 months, I removed the cable from the electrolytic bath and applied a thin layer of clear varnish to seal out moisture.

In the future, I plan to add information about the electrical characteristics of this cable and update these pages as I recover all six underwater cables. They will provide samples of the technological improvements in cables from 1866 to the 1900s and allow me to analyze how well they have survived over 100 years under the ocean.","The article discusses the author's experiences recovering early submarine telegraph cables, specifically detailing a diving expedition to cut and retrieve a cable laid between the United States and Havana, Cuba.

Electrical repairs on the ocean floor.  

_Four undersea telecom cables have broken in the past week, cutting off or severely slowing Internet traffic in countries along the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf. In an “Explainer” column first published last year and reprinted below, Lindsay Goldwert looked into how exactly they fix cables thousands of miles long and located thousands of feet under the waves._  

Powerful earthquakes near Taiwan shut off international phone and Internet service for the Far East just after Christmas. Five repair ships have been working on the damaged undersea cables since late last week. How do you repair a cable that’s lying across the ocean floor?  

Drag it to the surface. Earthquakes—like ships’ anchors and fishing trawls—can cause undersea fiber-optic cables to malfunction or break many miles below the surface of the water. When this happens, a telecom operator has to find the location of the accident, hoist up the damaged part, and replace it with a new stretch of cable.  

First, the telecom operator has to locate the part of the cable that’s no longer working. Cable engineers can figure out the general neighborhood of the problem based on the reported phone or Internet service outages. From terminal stations on shore, they can zero in on more specific coordinates by sending light pulses along the fibers in the cable. A working fiber will transmit those pulses all the way across the ocean, but a broken one will bounce it back from the site of the damage. By measuring the time it takes for the reflections to come back, the engineers can figure out where along the cable they have a problem.  

Once they know that, the company can send out a large cable ship with a few miles of fresh fiber-optic lines on board to make the repairs. If the faulty part of the cable is less than about 6,500 feet down, the crew will send out a submersible tanklike robot that can move around on the sea floor. A signal can be sent through the cable to guide the robot toward the problem spot. When the robot finds the right place, it grabs ahold of the cable, cuts out the nonworking section, and pulls the loose ends back up to the ship.  

The robot doesn’t work in very deep water (with very high pressure). In those situations, the technicians aboard the cable ship use a grapnel, or a hook on a very long wire, to snatch up the cable from the sea floor. The grapnel uses a mechanical cutting and gripping device that can split the cable on both sides of the break and drag the loose ends to the surface. One end is hooked onto a buoy so it won’t sink, and the other is hauled on board.  

The malfunctioning cable section can be fixed onboard the ship. A skilled technician or “jointer” splices the glass fibers and uses powerful adhesives to attach the new section of cable to each cut end of the original—a process that can take up to 16 hours. The repaired cable is then lowered back to the seabed on ropes.","The article titled ""How do you fix an undersea cable?"" provides a detailed examination of the issues surrounding undersea cables, specifically focusing on incidents that lead to cable breaks.

"Finger-thin Undersea Cables Connecting the World","Details on the disruption of communications across the Middle East and India due to the cutting of FLAG Europe Asia and SEA-ME-WE 4 cables, emphasizing the impact on global internet connectivity.","https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna22938899","","By By Peter Svensson",Yes,"Peter Svensson","30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, NY 10112, USA",-,"2008-01-31","English","NBC News","The lines that tie the globe together by carrying phone calls and Internet traffic are just two-thirds of an inch thick where they lie on the ocean floor.

The foundation for a connected world seems quite fragile, an impression reinforced this week when a break in two cables in the Mediterranean Sea disrupted communications across the Middle East and into India and neighboring countries.

Yet the network itself is fairly resilient. In fact, cables are broken all the time, usually by fishing lines and ship anchors, and few of us notice. It takes a confluence of factors for a cable break to cause an outage.

""Most telecom companies have capacity at multiple systems, so if one goes out, they simply reroute to a different system,"" said Stephan Beckert, analyst at research firm TeleGeography in Washington. ""It's just that in this case, both the main route and the backup route got cut for a lot of companies.""

The two cables — FLAG Europe Asia and SEA-ME-WE 4 — were cut on the ocean floor just north of Alexandria, Egypt.

By an accident of geography and global politics, Egypt is a choke point in the global communications network, just as it is with global shipping. The reasons are the same: The country touches both the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, which flows into the India Ocean.

The slim fiber-optic cables that carry the world's communications are much like ships, in that they're the cheapest way for carrying things over long distances. Pulling cable overland is much more expensive and requires negotiation with landowners and governments.

So fiber-optic cables that go from Europe to India take the sea route via Egypt's Suez Canal, just as ships do.

Another Mediterranean cable makes land not far away, in Israel.

But there's no cable overland from Israel into Jordan and to the Persian Gulf, which could have provided a redundant connection for the Gulf States and India. Going overland would have been more expensive and politically difficult — Israel and Arab countries would have to cooperate.

There is also no route that goes through Russia, Iran and Pakistan to India. The terrain is rugged, Pakistan is politically unstable, and India and Pakistan are not on good terms.

With two of the three cables passing through Suez cut, traffic from the Middle East and India intended for Europe was forced to route eastward, around most of the globe.

The main route goes through Japan and the United States, crossing both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. According to Beckert, this is normally the cheap way to go for Indian traffic, since capacity is high. However, the distance means more time required to reach Europe and get a response.

The other route from India to Europe goes over China into Russia and along the Trans-Siberian railroad.

Egypt is not the only check point in the global network. The ocean just south of Taiwan proved to be one in December 2006, when an earthquake cut seven of eight cables passing through the area, slowing down communications in Hong Kong and other parts of Asia for months.

Another possible vulnerability is the U.S. island of Guam in the Pacific Ocean. It is the spider at the center of a web of cables from the United States, Japan, Australia, the Philippines and China.

Both cables that connect the United States to Australia and New Zealand run over Hawaii, creating another choke point.

These bottlenecks are likely to go away, however, as telecoms build more and more lines. Another U.S.-Australia line is scheduled to be completed soon, according to Beckert, and a U.S.-China line that bypasses Japan is also in the works.

But it will be years before the network across Asia is as resilient as the trans-Atlantic network, where multiple high-capacity lines over different routes provide a connection that's almost impossible to disrupt. And the factors that make the Suez Canal a vulnerable point now will likely remain.

Mustafa Alani, head of the security and terrorism department at the Dubai-based Gulf Research Center, said the outage should be a ""wake-up call"" for governments and professionals to divert more resources to protect vital infrastructure.

""This shows how easy it would be to attack"" communications networks, he said.

Yet the owners of the undersea cables aren't very concerned with terrorism, according to Beckert. They're too busy worrying about fishing boats.

""They want to publish maps of their cables as widely as possible, so fishing crews know where they are,"" Beckert said. ""The risk of accidental cuts is much, much greater than the risk of deliberate cuts.","The article titled ""Finger-thin undersea cables tie world together"" discusses the topic of cut sea cables in detail.

It directly mentions a specific incident where two undersea cables, FLAG Europe Asia and SEA-ME-WE 4, were cut in the Mediterranean Sea, which disrupted communications across the Middle East and into India.

Damage to submarine cables in the Red Sea is disrupting telecommunications networks and forcing providers to reroute as much as a quarter of traffic between Asia, Europe and the Middle East, including internet traffic.

Cables belonging to four major telecoms networks have been “cut,” causing “significant” disruption to communications networks in the Middle East, according to Hong Kong telecoms company HGC Global Communications.

HGC estimates that 25% of traffic between Asia and Europe as well the Middle East has been impacted, it said in a statement Monday.

The company said it is rerouting traffic to minimize disruption for customers and also “extending assistance to affected businesses.”

HGC did not say how the cables had been damaged or who was responsible.

South Africa-based Seacom, which owns one of the cable systems affected, told CNN that repairs wouldn’t begin for at least another month, partly because of the length of time it takes to secure permits to operate in the area.

Underwater cables are the invisible force driving the internet, with many funded in recent years by internet giants such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook parent Meta. Damage to these subsea networks can cause widespread internet outages, as happened following the Taiwan earthquake in 2006.

The destruction of cables in the Red Sea comes weeks after the official Yemeni government warned of the possibility that Houthi rebels would target the cables. The Iranian-backed militants have already disrupted global supply chains by attacking commercial vessels in the crucial waterway.

Reports last week from Israeli news outlet Globes suggested the Houthis had been behind the damage to the cables. Yemeni rebel leader Abdel Malek al-Houthi denied the allegations. “We have no intention of targeting sea cables providing internet to countries in the region,” he said.

The Houthis have since blamed British and US military units operating in the area for the damage, according to a report Saturday by the rebels’ official news agency. CNN has contacted the UK and US governments for comment.

Seacom’s chief digital officer Prenesh Padayachee said acquiring permits from the Yemeni maritime authority to repair the cables could take up to eight weeks. “Client traffic will continue to be rerouted until we are able to repair the damaged cable,” he added.

Among the other networks affected is Asia-Africa-Europe 1, a 25,000-kilometer (15,534-mile) cable system connecting South East Asia to Europe via Egypt. The Europe India Gateway (EIG) has also been damaged.

EIG connects Europe, the Middle East and India and counts Vodafone as a major investor. Vodafone, a large mobile network operator in the United Kingdom, declined to comment.

The company says on its website that it can send internet traffic across some 80 submarine cable systems that reach 100 countries.

Most large telecoms companies rely on multiple undersea cable systems, allowing them to reroute traffic in the event of an outage to ensure uninterrupted service.

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly attributed the accusation that British and US military units were to blame for the damage to the cables.

Mike Loucks poses in his home space exploration engineering office, with a tangle of dedicated cables behind, Thursday, March 26, 2015, in Friday Harbor, Wash., in the San Juan Islands. Loucks lost Internet and phone service during a 10-day outage on the island in 2013. Other regions around the country also have fallen dark in recent years, sometimes for days at a time, because of failures or accidents affecting the nation’s broadband infrastructure. The failures have revealed vulnerabilities in the backbone of the nation’s high-speed Internet highway, which often lacks the detour routes necessary to quickly restore service when outages occur outside of major cities.

By FELICIA FONSECA and DAVID A. LIEB, Associated Press

FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) — When vandals sliced a fiber-optic cable in the Arizona desert last month, they did more than time-warp thousands of people back to an era before computers, credit cards or even phones. They exposed a glaring vulnerability in the nation's Internet infrastructure: no backup systems in many places.

Because Internet service is largely unregulated by the federal government and the states, decisions about network reliability are left to the service providers. Industry analysts say these companies generally do not build alternative routes, or redundancies, unless they believe it is worthwhile financially.

The result: While most major metropolitan areas in the U.S. have backup systems, some smaller cities and many rural areas do not.

""The more rural the location, the more likely that there's only one road in and out of that location,"" said Sean Donelan, a former infrastructure security manager in the U.S. Homeland Security Department who now works for a cybersecurity firm. ""If someone manages to cut that fiber, you'll generally see a one- or two- or three-day outage.""

Despite its own warnings about such vulnerabilities two decades ago, the federal government has taken no steps to require Internet companies to have backup systems, even as it has provided billions of dollars in subsidies to expand broadband Internet into unserved areas.

In northern Arizona last month, tens of thousands of residents were without Internet service — some for up to 15 hours — after vandals cut through an underground bundle of fiber-optic cables owned by CenturyLink. ATMs went down, stores couldn't process credit cards, college students in Flagstaff had to put their research on hold, and even 911 emergency service was lost.

Earlier this month, several thousand people lost Internet and phone service for half a day when an electric company crew accidentally cut a fiber-optic line in northern New Mexico.

When an underwater fiber-optic cable became wrapped around a big rock and broke in 2013, some residents of Washington state's San Juan Islands were without Internet and telephone service for 10 days.

Among them was aerospace consultant Mike Loucks, who said he was shocked to find out his home phone, cellphone and Internet service did not work independently of each other. All went down because they relied on the same cable. He ended up taking a ferry to the mainland to dial in to conference calls from his car outside a McDonald's.

""When I figured out what all had been routed to this cable, it's a single-point failure thing,"" he said. ""That's pretty dumb. Why don't you guys have a backup cable?""

He was so frustrated that he switched Internet providers.

CenturyLink, the broadband provider in the Arizona and Washington outages, declined to make officials available for an interview about its Internet infrastructure. But spokeswoman Linda Johnson said in an email that the company acts quickly to restore service and ""is constantly investing in its local network and strives to deliver new services and build redundancy where possible.""

After the San Juan Islands outage, CenturyLink spent $500,000 to install a microwave system that now backs up the underwater cable. A microwave system is wireless technology that relies on a series of above-ground antennas or towers to transmit data. It's more often used in rural areas.

Companies have been deploying more than 10 million miles of fiber annually in the U.S., increasing the risk of damage from backhoes, trench-diggers and shovels, according to an analysis by a network reliability committee of the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions. The number of outages on high-capacity fiber-optic lines in the U.S. more than doubled from 221 in 2010 to 487 last year, according to the Federal Communications Commission.

Fiber-optic cables form the spine of the Internet. A fiber bundle contains dozens of tiny glass fibers — each about the width of a human hair — that use light waves to transmit data. The fibers often are buried along existing rights of way for highways, railroads or pipelines. It is common for a telecommunications company to install the cables and then lease space on them to others.

That saves money for everyone involved. But it also means outages can affect a wide variety of services.

As early as 1995, the U.S. Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology warned that the ""power of optical fiber technology is diminishing the number of geographic transmission routes,"" concentrating the flow of information and ""resulting in an increase in network vulnerability.""

Since 2009, the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce departments have provided about $10 billion in grants and loans to expand broadband Internet access. The departments said recipients were encouraged but not required to build redundancies into their projects.

The FCC says about half the rural U.S. lacks access to high-speed Internet service. It plans to distribute about $20 billion over the next five years to support rural broadband. It does not require recipients to build network backup systems against outages.

The funding ""is designed to expand broadband to as many rural Americans as possible while not increasing the cost of the program"" to customers, FCC spokesman Mark Wigfield said.

The FCC recently increased its oversight of Internet providers by classifying them as ""telecommunications services"" that must operate in the public interest. But that doesn't carry any new mandate for Internet network redundancies, because such backups aren't required of phone companies, he said.

Some states have laws specifically barring the regulation of Internet service, and it's outside the jurisdiction of many state utility regulatory agencies.

Washington state Rep. Jeff Morris, who represents the San Juan Islands and is chairman of the House Technology and Economic Development Committee, said lawmakers are hesitant to require redundant lines for fear they will lead to higher Internet and phone bills for their constituents. His colleagues have discussed taxing access to Internet services, but that is prohibited by federal law.

""It really spoils our ability to generate revenue to give better service and reliability to our constituents,"" he said.

Some state officials are nonetheless trying to nudge Internet providers to develop backup plans.

""Dependability is premier to the Internet these days,"" said Sandy Jones, a member of New Mexico's Public Regulation Commission. ""Redundancy — two paths out, three paths out — is really critical for businesses. Just think of restaurants, gas stations, all the things that shut down when there's no Internet line.""","The article discusses various incidents of Internet outages, including a specific case where vandals cut a fiber-optic cable in Arizona and a significant mention of an underwater fiber-optic cable that broke, impacting residents of the San Juan Islands for 10 days.

This incident demonstrates the effects of cut cables on internet connectivity and highlights vulnerabilities in broadband infrastructure.

The underwater cable incident is treated with importance, indicating that it is not just a minor mention but is relevant to the central theme of the article regarding the implications of such outages.

Therefore, the article satisfies the criterion of being on the topic of cut sea cables."

A French ship has begun repairing two undersea cables in the Mediterranean that were severed on Friday, disrupting internet and phone communications.

A robot submarine will locate the ends of the cables on the sea bed and bring them to the surface to be re-connected. They were cut within 5 minutes of each other, possibly by a trawler net.

Egypt says it has been able to restore most of its communications by re-routing services, but other parts of the Middle East remain badly affected.

**Lengthy process**

Experts from France Telecom Marine arrived at the site of the damage to the SEA-ME-WE4 and SEA-ME-WE3 lines onboard the cable ship, Raymond Croze. They then sent a remotely-operated submarine robot called ""Hector"" to the sea bed to begin the search for the two ends of each line.

It is unclear how long repairs will take, as a ship could have dragged the cables several kilometres from their normal positions. Once located, the cable ends will be brought to the surface by the robot and repairs will be carried out in a special facility on the ship - a process that could take days.

France Telecom said it expected to repair SEA-ME-WE4 by 25 December and SEA-ME-WE3 by the end of the year. A third line, operated by FLAG Telecom, was also cut and will be repaired by another ship. In January the same line was damaged off Egypt's Mediterranean coast, severely disrupting internet and phone communications for many in the Middle East for days, although only two lines were snapped then.

A few hours before the three lines were cut, a suspected sub-sea earthquake damaged a local GO cable to Malta, severely disrupting communications to the island.","The article discusses a specific incident involving two undersea cables that were severed in the Mediterranean, detailing the location, cause, and impact on communications.

Sensitive data remains safe as long as undersea cables are in good physical condition, but events such as severe sabotage—in the form of cutting cables—could leak data and interrupt vital international communications. Today, when events that damage or cut a cable, (including acts of sabotage) happen in international waters, there is no effective regime to hold the perpetrator of a physical attack accountable.

The United States and its allies and partners have come to understand how important it is to secure the world’s undersea cables. But there haven’t yet been enough efforts that incorporate all countries in a protection pact. The reality is that cable cutting could severely impact the lives of citizens in countries across the globe, from Tonga to Norway and far beyond. Thus, intergovernmental organizations such as the United Nations (UN) must take undersea cable security seriously, including by forming internationally recognized and formalized protections.

#### Risks are growing under the sea

Threats to undersea cables are increasing. For example, Russia is well positioned to conduct malicious attacks on undersea cables with the help of its intelligence ship, Yantar, which was spotted loitering near cable locations in 2019 and 2021. NATO Assistant Secretary General for Intelligence and Security David Cattler expressed particular concern about Russian activity in European waters, following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Cattler told reporters in May 2023 that Russia could attack infrastructure such as undersea cables in an attempt to “disrupt Western life and gain leverage over those nations that are providing support to Ukraine.”

For a sense of how interruptive cable cutting could be, look to the African continent and the Matsu Islands. In April 2018, damage to the Africa Coast to Europe cable—which at the time connected twenty-two countries along the western coast of Africa and Europe—caused significant connectivity issues (and in some cases days-long blackouts) for ten countries. Reporters suggested that the damage could have been caused by Sierra Leone, as the country’s government seemed to have imposed other internet blackouts on its citizens around the same time, impacting communications for not just social but also economic and governance matters.

In February 2023, two Chinese vessels on two separate instances severed cables in the East China Sea—one on February 2 and another on February 8. Although there is no direct evidence that the vessels did so intentionally, Taiwanese local officials said that the cable cuts are part of repeated cable breaks that amount to harassment by China. For nearly two months, the over thirteen thousand residents of the Taipei-governed Matsu Islands endured an internet outage, encountering great difficulty when conducting business and communicating. For China, understanding how undersea cable cuts can impact Taiwan provides useful insights that can be leveraged in both traditional and hybrid warfare.

These interruptions hit particularly hard when countries don’t have many connection points. For example, while Saudi Arabia has sixteen cable connections, the Matsu Islands only have two connections. Norway’s Svalbard archipelago similarly only has two connections, while Tonga only has one. The impact of a severe cable cut also depends on a country’s ability to fix damaged or degraded cables. It took Taiwan over a month to repair cables stretching to the Matsu Islands. For Tonga, whose cable was damaged by a volcanic eruption in 2022, it took ten days for a cable repair ship stationed in Papua New Guinea to even reach the island before beginning repairs, which then took several weeks.

Clusters of countries have begun to acknowledge the increasing threats to undersea cables. For example, in 2019, Japan outlined the Data Free Flow with Trust (DFFT) concept that promotes the free flow of data and the protection of individual privacy, national security, and intellectual property by connecting undersea cables only with allies and partner nations. At a May 2023 summit in Hiroshima, the Group of Seven (G7) endorsed the creation of the Institutional Arrangement for Partnership, which puts DFFT into action. The G7 also issued a communiqué (albeit more of a political consensus than any sort of treaty) with a section committing to collaborate more on undersea cable security.

Should the G7 countries follow through on their commitment—for example, by investing in an undersea cable project together—they could affect geopolitics in the undersea cable world and highlight to political and business leaders how necessary it is to keep countries connected through cables.

The G7’s progress and NATO’s recent establishment of a London-based center on protecting undersea cables are examples of how the United States prefers to share cables with likeminded countries. These efforts also demonstrate how democratic states are joining together in smaller consortia to invest in establishing and securing undersea communication cables.

Democratic states are also investing in undersea cables as a way to spread the free flow of data. In June 2023, the East Micronesia Cable project to connect several islands in Oceania began, funded by Australia, Japan, and the United States—with the understanding that connectivity is vital to economic development and, in this case, a means to counter Chinese influence in the region. The project was slow to start, as it faced a stalemate after China’s HMN Technologies submitted a tempting bid to build the cable, and the United States warned the Pacific islands about the risks associated with the participation of a Chinese company. Soon after, all bids were deemed noncompliant and removed from consideration, a challenge to China’s increasing control of digital traffic in Oceania.

China’s influence in the undersea cable world has grown immensely in recent years. In 2019, China owned, supplied, or was a landing point for over 11 percent of the world’s undersea cables, and it is aiming to grow this proportion to 20 percent by 2030. US warnings about Chinese cable companies demonstrate how Washington, with its allies and partners, is working to counter Chinese influence in supplying undersea cables in the Pacific.

#### A global deterrence plan

The world’s information is in serious danger, as perpetrators could resort to malicious attacks not only to interrupt connectivity but also to tap into the cables and eavesdrop. When undersea cables are cut or damaged, the laws that determine who is responsible for sabotage vary depending on where the cables are laid. For example, a coastal state has sovereign rights in its territorial sea, according to Article 21 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). In addition, a coastal state may exercise its rights to repair and maintain undersea cables in its exclusive economic zone, according to UNCLOS Article 58.

However, in regard to cables that are sabotaged in international waters, there is currently no effective regime to hold the perpetrator of damage responsible. If cables are willfully or accidentally damaged by a ship or person, the jurisdiction to determine an appropriate punishment for the perpetrator lies with the state under whose flag the ship operates or that of the person’s citizenship. Because this places onus on the perpetrator’s state, not the state that owns the cable, there is no effective regime to ensure that the responsible party is held accountable directly.

It is time for an intergovernmental organization such as the UN or its International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to take undersea cable security seriously and establish internationally recognized protocols under a formalized protection plan that deters actions against undersea cables and prioritizes the security of digital communications.","The article titled ""International law doesn’t adequately protect undersea cables.

**Author:** Hiral Vora  

MUMBAI (Reuters) - A third undersea cable was cut on Friday, just two days after two breaks near Egypt disrupted Web access in parts of the Middle East and Asia, Indian-owned cable network operator FLAG Telecom said.

Egypt lost more than half its Internet capacity because of Wednesday’s breaks and intends to seek compensation, its ministry of communications said in a news release.

FLAG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of India’s number two mobile operator Reliance Communications, said its FALCON cable had been reported cut at 0559 GMT, 56 kms (35 miles) from Dubai, between the United Arab Emirates and Oman.

Egyptian telecom authorities said about 55 percent of the country’s Internet capacity had been restored by Friday, thanks to rerouting of traffic. Egypt is to ask FLAG and SEA-ME-WE to compensate its Internet and call centre companies.

The International Cable Protection Committee has declined to speculate on the cause of the breaches, saying investigations were underway. It said more than 95 percent of transoceanic telecoms and data traffic are carried by undersea cables.

**REPAIRS**  
“The repair ship has been notified and expected to arrive at the (Dubai) site in (the) next few days,” FLAG said.  
The Internet Service Providers’ Association of India said cable repair ships had already been sent to fix the breaches off northern Egypt.

U.S. phone companies Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc both use the cables which were affected on Wednesday. AT&T said its networks were already back to normal as it had rerouted traffic and Verizon expected service to be restored for all its customers within days.

One of the biggest disruptions of modern telecoms systems was in December 2006, when a magnitude 7.1 earthquake broke nine submarine cables between Taiwan and the Philippines, cutting connections between southeast Asia and the rest of the world.

Traffic was rerouted through other cables, but it took 49 days to restore full capacity.","The article discusses the cutting of undersea cables, their implications on internet connectivity, and the responses from telecommunications operators and authorities.

"Undersea Cables: Critical Infrastructure Facing Growing Vulnerabilities","Examines recent attacks on undersea cables, including a Red Sea incident causing major communication disruptions, underscoring their critical role in global connectivity.","https://www.orfonline.org/research/undersea-cables-are-increasingly-critical-and-vulnerable","","Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan",Yes,"Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan","New Delhi, India",-,"2024-03-27","English","Observer Research Foundation (ORF)","Recent events in the Red Sea have brought to the fore another security vulnerability, that of the security of undersea telecommunications cables.

UAE officials in early March said that three cables running through the Red Sea had been possibly attacked by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, although the Houthis themselves denied it. The cables provide connectivity for both internet and telecommunications across different regions. The media report noted that the alleged attack tampered with many communication cable lines, including Asia-Africa-Europe 1, the Europe India Gateway, Seacom and TGN (Tata Global Network)-Gulf, and Hong Kong-based HGC Global Communications.

Reportedly, the cuts impacted 25 percent of the communications passing through Red Sea from Asia to Europe. Many companies have had to take immediate remedial steps, including re-routing, in order to limit the effect of the cable cuts. Tata Communications for instance said that they are “keeping a close watch on the situation and had initiated immediate and appropriate remedial actions.” Tata Communications added that they “invest in various cable consortiums to increase our diversity and hence in such situations of a cable cut or snag we are able to automatically reroute our services, thereby ensuring our customers have a stable, reliable and scalable connectivity.”

The Red Sea has long been considered a maritime shipping choke point but it is also “an internet and telecommunications bottleneck,” according to experts at the Center for International and Strategic Studies (CSIS). With around 90 percent of communications between Europe and Asia, as well as 17 percent of global internet traffic, passing through cables under the narrow Bab al-Mandab Strait, it is a major chokepoint for the communication sector.

According to a recent Congressional Research Service (CRS) report, “commercial undersea telecommunication cables carry about 99% of transoceanic digital communications (e.g., voice, data, internet), including financial transactions.”

Undersea cables are critical infrastructure with important implications for the global economy and communication system connecting different regions. According to a recent Congressional Research Service (CRS) report, “commercial undersea telecommunication cables carry about 99% of transoceanic digital communications (e.g., voice, data, internet), including financial transactions.” The report added that there are more than 500 commercial undersea cables owned and operated by individual private companies as well as consortia of companies; these cables have become the mainstay of the global internet.

The importance of these cables, covering over 1.4 million kilometers connecting literally every country in the world, cannot be ignored. With more big companies entering the fray, this number will likely go up in the coming years. Already, big global firms such as Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft dominate the scene, owning or leasing around half of all undersea bandwidth. But such heavy dependence can mean a significant vulnerability and in turn calls for greater protection.

There have been intentional and unintentional attacks on undersea cable infrastructure. The Nord Stream pipeline attack in September 2022 highlighted the vulnerability faced by such cables and led to calls for ensuring better protective measures for undersea telecommunication cables. In terms of intentional attacks on telecommunication cables, two incidents in April and October 2022 are noteworthy, when multiple cables were cut in southern France. This appeared to have been a coordinated and targeted attack. A cloud security company, Zscaler, in a blog post said that the attack “impacted major cables with connectivity to Asia, Europe, the U.S. and potentially other parts of the world.”

There have been also many natural events that have cut or damaged cables, resulting in interference and disruptions in communication. Undersea cable damage in Tonga, a South Pacific archipelago nation, after a volcanic eruption in January 2022 is a case in point. Cloudfare said in a blog post that internet connections had been restored after 38 days, following the successful completion of repairs to the undersea cable. Equally critical to note is that cable repair is extremely challenging and expensive. In the Tonga case, it was estimated that the daily costs for the ship responsible for repairing the cable, the CS Reliance, was between $35,000 and $50,000.

It is, however, an increasing challenge to identify if damage to undersea cables is intentional or the result of natural events or accidents. Analysts have noted that damage can be caused by fishing nets, weather, ship anchors, sharks, or even sinking cargo ships, as was seen in the recent Red Sea incident. Inability to make a distinction between intentional attacks and accidents can be problematic for a couple of different reasons. First, potential saboteurs can benefit from the difficulty in determining specific causes of damage. And second, this ambiguity generates challenges in terms of governance and regulatory measures aiming to better undersea cable security.

There are no easy answers to dealing with undersea cable security. First and foremost, along with cybersecurity and protection of other vital infrastructure, undersea cables need to be treated as critical infrastructure. The need to acknowledge the vulnerability this poses to global communication systems is the first step. A second step may be for firms to invest in diverse cable consortiums so that it is possible to re-route and thereby create redundancy in order to mitigate the effects of undersea cable disruptions.

Also, the protection of undersea cables can be pursued through minilateral groupings such as the Quad. The Quad in May 2023 announced a new initiative for undersea cable protection in the Indo-Pacific, called the “Quad Partnership for Cable Connectivity and Resilience” as part of its broader efforts to develop better and more resilient infrastructure. Considering that the potential damage to undersea cables can affect all countries, a larger global multilateral effort should also be undertaken, despite the fact that multilateral efforts are increasingly threatened by rising great power competition.","The article discusses the vulnerabilities and security concerns surrounding undersea telecommunications cables, including specific incidents of cable cuts and their impacts.

At the bottom of the freezing Sea of Okhotsk, deep inside Russian waters, a US submarine creeps into position. Navy divers emerge from a hatch they call “the Bat Cave” and sneak along the dark ocean floor, searching for a cable just centimetres wide on which they’ve planted a listening device.

It’s the 1970s and this is one of the most daring missions of the Cold War: wiretapping the secret communications cable between the Soviet fleet’s Pacific base and headquarters in Russia.

For a decade, US divers would return every month to retrieve the latest transmissions captured from their bug so analysts at the US spy agency the NSA could binge-listen to the juicy disclosures – from Soviet nuclear secrets to commanders’ conversations with their mistresses.

A high-stakes Cold War wiretap under the sea might sound leagues away from our “wireless” world today. But the internet is not held in the “cloud” or beamed down by satellites – at least, not for the most part. More than 95 per cent of our data runs through a little-known network of undersea cables, each not much wider than a garden hose, stretching thousands of kilometres long.

While these cables are faster than satellites, some experts warn they are not well protected – and sabotage still happens. As Russia wages war in Ukraine and China expands into the private cable market, many countries are ramping up their underwater surveillance, including Australia.

### What is the undersea internet network?

Right now, these words are likely travelling along the bottom of the ocean at close to the speed of light. Fibre-optic cables that transmit data as light are the superhighways on which the internet (and phone lines) travel between continents – they have much higher bandwidth than satellites and are specially reinforced to lie at the bottom of the sea, even resisting shark bites.

More than 450 undersea internet cables crisscross the Earth, covering more than 1 million kilometres in total, and dozens more are planned. They can zap the equivalent of the United States’ entire collection in the Library of Congress across the other side of the world in moments. Australia is connected by at least a dozen cables itself, many of which land in Sydney and Perth.

Still, they are vulnerable – especially to natural disasters or stray boat anchors. Tonga is connected by just one subsea cable and at the start of this year, it was cut off from the world for more than a month when a volcanic eruption knocked out that line.

That’s why charting a new undersea cable route can take a year of planning. About 46,000 kilometres of new cable on average are installed globally each year – unspooled from specially fitted-out ships. “Picture almost a farmyard plough behind a tractor,” says Camplin-Warner. Near shore, “we bury the cable down into the seabed” for extra protection. Sensors on large ships set off alarms if they get too close. And Telstra uses an “Always On” system to near-instantly reroute internet traffic from one cable to another if there’s a problem. 

Of course, the world’s small fleet of cable repair ships – those designed to haul up the damaged section of cable and splice in a new one – are also privately owned. “And there’s not enough,” says Anthony Bergin, a senior defence analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI). “It was weeks before a repair ship came out to Tonga and fixed their cable.”

### How secure are the cables?

With more of the world moving online – not to mention new underwater energy cables to export solar power and more – Bergin argues it’s time we took the security of all undersea cables more seriously. After all, you can find most on public maps. And, while there are still a few government cables off the books, Ivy Bells style, for more sensitive information, Stoltz says the vast bulk of agency intelligence worldwide travels along the same cables that carry commercial data.","The article titled ""A dozen undersea cables connect Australia to the internet. What happens if they get hacked – or cut?"" extensively discusses the topic of undersea cables, including their vulnerabilities and the implications of them being cut.

Undersea cables are vulnerable to many forces — both natural and man-made, so those cables need to be designed and built with additional protection in order to make them resistant and reliable.

Even though hidden deep in the sea and invisible to us, submarine cables are of crucial importance for our daily lives. Undersea cables carry 99 percent of all intercontinental communication, which means that business and private communications, as well as financial transactions, are absolutely depending on their efficiency.

Submarine power cables are deployed as well in the offshore industry by oil and gas rigs and marine renewable energy installations to provide power, shore-to-platform and internal platform fiber-optic communications, and oceanographic monitoring and surveillance.

Unfortunately, undersea cables are vulnerable and do break or get damaged by ships’ anchors, trawling, or due to some other environmental issues. For that reason, submarine cables need to be designed and built with additional protection, making them resistant and reliable enough.

### Possible Applications of Submarine Cables

Submarine power cables are dedicated to the transportation of the electric power below the surface of the water. Most of the time, they are coupled with optic fibers in order to monitor the cables but also to ensure the communication of the data. Exposed to tough conditions as heat, cold, and saltwater, but also to external events such as dragging anchors, dropping objects, and fishing, their protection is crucial to their performance.

Governments and industrial key players are uniting their expertise and funds to look for reliable submarine cable protection solutions. Many efforts have been made in design and material selection but also laying and maintenance vessels. The sector is in continuous development and in search of reliable innovative solutions.

### Available Submarine Cable Protection Solutions

Depending on the industry, the seabed conditions, and the depth, there are various submarine protection systems available right now at the market. All of them share the same objective: protecting the submarine cables from fatigue, overbending, and external factors.

Bend restrictors, bend stiffeners, protecting and ballasting shells, or split pipes are used at the bottom of the foundations to protect the cable near the platform. Most of the time, the entire system is called a CPS (cable protection system).

Concrete mattress, rock dumping, and rock bags are used to protect longer cable sections. However, the main solution to protect the longer section of cables (inter-array and export cables) is to bury the cable on the seabed.

### Case Study: Protecting and Ballasting Cast-Iron Shells

FMGC is a European leader in the design and manufacture of cast-iron counterweights. Its participation in various projects marks an important milestone in the development of the industry in France, aiming to develop a full range of articulated cast iron shells that protect, ballast, and stabilize subsea conducts (cables, pipes, etc.).

### Floating Offshore Wind Applications

All recent technological advancements in the offshore wind industry result in the increase of the viability of large offshore turbines capable of taking advantage of the higher wind speeds in greater water depths. These structures need submarine cables to run through the water, from their substructure base to the seabed. 

Their protection is of critical importance due to the increased risk of failure from mechanical stress produced by marine currents and the movement of waves.","The article discusses submarine cables and their vulnerabilities extensively, mentioning that they can be damaged by various forces, including ships' anchors and environmental issues.

There has been some concern that the undersea internet cables, that have been cut recently, are perhaps no accident?

The first incident happened 8km from Alexandria in Egypt, which involved 2 cables apparently alongside each other. According to initial reports, the cables may have been ""snapped"" by a ship´s anchor.

Whilst this explanation is certainly a possibility, it seems a strange coincidence that barely two days later another cable is cut, this time 56km from Dubai in the Persian Gulf. There is even rumor of a fourth cable being damaged, but this has not been confirmed.

The countries most affected by the damaged cables are Egypt, India and the Middle East (in particular Iran). Israel and Iraq, as far as we can tell, were not affected by this problem as they use an alternative route for this service.

Cables involved in the ""breaks"" belong to companies connected to Reliance Communication Ventures, where Anil Ambani has a 66.75% interest. His father (Dhirubhai Ambani) originally founded the company and it is a classical rags to riches story.

Dhirubhai Ambani started with absolutely nothing, but developed a company that was a huge success. Questions were raised about how Dhirubhai managed to raise so much cash to do this, and this appears to be the result of a ""Non-Resident Indian"" investing Rs. 220 million in Reliance during 1982-1983. Dhirubhai has been accused of ""manipulating"" government policies and was known to be a ""king-maker"" in government elections (enjoying a certain amount of media protection). He was also involved in other business interests, including the oil industry.

Following Dhirubhai´s death in 2002, the company was split between the Ambani brothers, with the youngest (Anil Ambani) taking control of Reliance. Anil, born June 4 1959, is the 6th richest person in the world (worth $45 billion).

On the assumption that the cables cut were no accident, we must ask ourselves who would do such a thing and why. Clearly Iran, who were most affected, would gain nothing from such an action and are perhaps the target of those responsible?

But why would anyone want to disrupt communications in Iran (and other countries)? Could this be some subtle message to Iran, an example of how their communications can be affected by outside forces? Maybe this is a prelude to an attack, or perhaps a test run for a future one?

Communication has always been an important factor in military action, and cutting these cables might affect Iran´s ability to defend itself. But even if that were not the case, it would certainly make it difficult for them to report any events to the outside world. So, if they were attacked, we would have to rely on news reports from the usual sources (the Mainstream Media), and we all know where their loyalties lie.

Oddly enough, Russia also experienced some ""internet problems"" during this same period, but that may be another coincidence?","The article titled ""Undersea internet cable cut in Middle East - Should Iran be worried?"" discusses the cutting of undersea internet cables in detail.

It mentions specific incidents, such as two cables cut near Alexandria, Egypt, and another near Dubai, suggesting a pattern that raises concerns about whether these cuts were accidental.

On Saturday, CEO Mark Simpson sent out a message saying multiple cable systems continue to be affected across Africa, the Middle East and Asia.

@MWEBGuy says the Internet service provider (ISP) is currently trying to source additional capacity. The social media face of the ISP was responding to queries from subscribers about slow or no Internet service posted on Twitter.

Internet Solutions has also experienced problems as a result of the outage, with its Twitter account indicating it has rerouted traffic and added bandwidth, but some people may experience latency. It does not give a timeframe for resolution.

### Work in progress

Simpson says the exact root cause is not likely to be known until the cable is repaired in the coming week or two, and the damaged section is recovered from the seabed and inspected. ""I know that many of you are keen to know the cause of the outage is a physical cable cut some kilometres north of the coast of Egypt in the Mediterranean Sea.""

Seacom suspects, based on its experience with sub-sea systems and the nature of the sea area where the cut has occurred, that ""the most likely cause is external aggression to the cable, most probably caused by a larger vessel dragging its anchor across the seabed"".

This is a common cause of damage to cable systems globally, despite continued efforts to protect the cable with armour, burying, notifications to ships of cable location and exclusion zones, notes Simpson.

Simpson says the Seacom team remains committed to getting restoration services up. ""However, this process is proving much more complex and taking longer than we were initially told by our suppliers and would have expected.""

Seacom continues to push for activation as a priority, coordinating across a number of carriers internationally, says Simpson. ""However, as this is not providing solutions in the timeframe we require, we are also actively seeking new restoration solutions. This will continue to take some time and we are not able to provide timeframes as yet on when services will be restored.","The article 'Seacom suffers cable break' discusses a specific incident involving a break in an undersea cable, detailing its impact on internet connectivity and the efforts to restore service.

It mentions the cause of the break, the affected regions, and the expected timeframe for repairs, all of which align with the criteria for being on the topic of cut sea cables.

No, it wasn’t just you, or because of the lockdown either. The internet across much of South Africa was slow this weekend thanks to yet another undersea cable break.

The WACS cable broke between the UK and Portugal this weekend, leaving much of the western portion of South Africa with longer load times and all-round slower internet during the initial days of the COVID-19 lockdown.

"Undersea Cable Damage Causes Internet Outages Across Africa","Disruption of internet services in Ivory Coast, Liberia, and Benin due to damage to four major cables; critical telecommunications impact highlighted.","https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/outages/undersea-cable-damage-causes-internet-outages-across-africa","","Bloomberg News",Yes,"Bloomberg News","San Francisco, California, USA","10000","2024-06-03","English","Bloomberg News","(Bloomberg) -- Damage to four subsea cables off the west coast of Africa is disrupting internet services across the continent.

The West Africa Cable System, MainOne, South Atlantic 3, and ACE sea cables – arteries for telecommunications data – were all affected on Thursday and early Friday, triggering outages and connectivity issues for a second day for mobile operators and internet service providers, according to data from internet-analysis firms including NetBlocks, Kentik, and Cloudflare. The cause of the cable faults has not yet been determined.

Data show a major disruption to connectivity in eight West African countries, with Ivory Coast, Liberia, and Benin being the most affected, NetBlocks, an internet watchdog, said in a post on X. Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon are among other countries impacted. Several companies have also reported service disruptions in South Africa.

“This is a devastating blow to internet connectivity along the west coast of Africa, which will be operating in a degraded state for weeks to come,” said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis firm Kentik.

Ghana’s National Communications Authority said the cable disruptions occurred in Senegal, Ivory Coast, and Portugal.

“This has led to a significant degradation of data services across the country, with mobile network operators working around the clock to restore full services,” the authority said.

The cable faults off Ivory Coast come less than a month after three telecommunications cables were severed in the Red Sea, highlighting the vulnerability of critical communications infrastructure. The anchor of a cargo ship sunk by Houthi militants was probably responsible, according to assessments by the US and cable industry group the Internet Cable Protection Committee.

The Red Sea is a critical telecommunications route, connecting Europe to Africa and Asia via Egypt. The damaged cables carried about 25% of traffic in the region, according to estimates from Hong Kong-based internet provider HGC Global Communications, which uses the cables. It was re-routed via alternative cables, including via the west coast of Africa.

Together, the problems with cables on either side of the continent create a capacity crunch, with customers of those cables scrambling to find alternative routes.

Africa’s biggest wireless carriers – MTN Group and Vodacom Group – said connectivity issues on undersea cable failures were affecting South Africa network providers. “Multiple undersea-cable failures between South Africa and Europe are currently impacting network providers,” Vodacom said in a text message.

MTN said services in several West African countries were affected and it was working to “reroute traffic through alternative network paths” and “engaging with our partners to speed up the repair process for the damaged cables.”

Microsoft Corporation reported disruptions to its cloud services and Microsoft 365 applications across Africa.

“We have determined that multiple fiber cables on the west coast of Africa have been impacted which reduced total capacity supporting our regions in South Africa,” Microsoft said in a status update, adding that the Red Sea cable cuts are also impacting the east coast. “The combination of incidents has impacted all Africa capacity – including other cloud providers and public internet as well.”

The Downdetector website showed that a number of companies in South Africa were still severely affected on Friday, including Microsoft and Nedbank Group.

Telkom SA SOC’s Openserve fiber unit and Standard Bank Group were also affected, they said in statement, with Openserve adding it had re-routed traffic.

Off the southeastern coast of South Africa, the island country of Mauritius also experienced outages, with Mauritius Telecom having to arrange to redirect traffic to other cables, it said.

Last year, the West African Cable System, along with another pipe – the South Atlantic 3 – were damaged near the mouth of the Congo River following an undersea landslide. The loss of the cables knocked out international traffic traveling along the west coast of Africa and took about a month to repair.","The article titled 'Undersea Cable Damage Causes Internet Outages Across Africa' discusses significant damage to four subsea cables off the west coast of Africa, specifically the West Africa Cable System, MainOne, South Atlantic 3, and ACE cables.

It details the disruption of internet services across several African countries including Ivory Coast, Liberia, and Benin, highlighting the severe impact on connectivity and communication.

The article states that the cause of the cable faults has not been determined but emphasizes the critical role these cables play in telecommunications.

Furthermore, it mentions previous incidents of cable damage and the ongoing issues faced by major telecommunications companies in restoring services.

This comprehensive coverage of undersea cable damage, its causes, and the consequences on internet connectivity aligns well with the criterion of discussing cut sea cables."

*By Joel Khalili*  
  
Despite what Wi-Fi and mobile data might lead people to believe, the internet is less of a nebulous cloud of data in the air above us, and more of an intricate mesh of wires firing away beneath our feet.  
  
The world’s online networks are powered by a complex system of underwater and underground cabling, supplemented in some regions by satellite links.  
  
Around 380 undersea cables carry over 99.5% of all transoceanic data, running for 750,000 miles across the ocean floor. These fiber optic wires connect the massive data centers supporting cloud behemoths such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.  
  
The total number of submarine cables shot up during a period of rapid growth in the mid-2000s, followed by an interval during which relatively little new cable was laid, but available capacity was slowly exhausted. A renewed demand for bandwidth, caused by the rapid growth of connected devices, is now propelling a new wave of cable initiatives.  
  
However, despite exponential growth in quantity and capacity, whole countries can be plunged into blackout if just one cable is damaged or snapped, with ramifications for household users and businesses alike.  
  
Undersea cables are usually run through areas of deep ocean to minimize the possibility of damage. But the deep sea is a harsh environment, and cables laid at extreme depth can be challenging to access if repairs are required.  
  
According to telecoms research firm Telegeography, there are over 100 cable breaks per year. Many of these go unnoticed in developed regions with extensive redundancies, but the infrastructure keeping us online is still far more fragile than any of us realize.  
  
In many developed countries, particularly in the West and Asia, internet access is more or less taken for granted as a constant – even a moment’s downtime is met with anger and frustration. But this isn’t the case for much of the world, where connections are intermittent, unreliable, or even non-existent.  
  
For instance, in 2018, the west African nation of Mauritania was taken offline for two whole days after the Africa Coast to Europe cable was severed by a fishing trawler.  
  
Millions in Yemen were also thrown off the internet last year after the submarine Falcon cable was severed, with its repair made even more complex by the ongoing civil war in the country.  
  
It might seem staggering that whole nations can so easily be taken offline, even if only temporarily. But not all countries enjoy the luxury of extensive redundancies in the event a cable is damaged.  
  
In total, 19 countries – about 10% of countries globally – are supported by only a single submarine cable. If you include countries supported by just two cables, the total number of people relying on a tenuous connection rises to almost 450 million, or 5.57% of the global population.  
  
Reliable internet connection was once viewed as a luxury, but loss of internet can now have severe and wide-reaching consequences, both for individual businesses and entire economies.

This piece also speaks directly to authorities within the Indian Navy and the Indian Coast Guard, as well as to other organisational structures concerned with India’s national security and the physical and electronic protection of India critical infrastructure. In seeking to mitigate the vulnerabilities attending submarine cables in India, Part-2 of this article will address legal aspects that ought to be of interest (and concern) to the Indian Navy’s Judge Advocate General’s Branch, the Legal & Treaties Division of the Ministry of External Affairs, the Ministry of Telecommunications, and, the Ministry of Law and Justice, as also to legal academic and research institutes in India and the larger Indian Ocean Region. The article strongly recommends that submarine communications cables landing in India be included within India’s “Critical Information Infrastructure System” (CIIS), and, that India exercise prescriptive jurisdiction over such submarine cables even under the High Seas, under the principle of “protective jurisdiction”.

While rapid technological advancements have transformed the submarine communications cable from a copper-based telegraph cable in 1850 to advanced fibre-optic cables today connecting continents across the globe, the development of the legal and regulatory mechanism to protect such cables from damage and interception leaves much to be desired.

The term “submarine cable” has been widely used, including in international treaties such as the United Nations Convention on the Laws of the Sea, but very little attempt appears to have been made to define it or to address the systems and networks associated with the term, at the international level. Even at the domestic level, at least amongst countries of the Indo-Pacific, there appears to be a very worrisome dearth in the degree of legal comprehensiveness with which this subject has been dealt. An exception is Australia, which ""is one of only a few nations with a dedicated regime for the protection of submarine cables"". Schedule 3A of Australia’s “Telecommunications Act 1997” specifies in considerable detail, the legal regime for the protection of international submarine cables landing in Australia. As such, it offers an excellent example of a “best practice” that India’s own legal and maritime-strategic communities would do exceedingly well to study.

Australia’s domestic “Telecommunications Act” defines a submarine cable as a specific type of “line link”. Within this expression, a ‘line’ itself is defined as a wire, cable, optical fibre, tube, conduit, waveguide or other physical medium used, or for use, as a continuous artificial guide for or in connection with carrying communications by means of guided electromagnetic energy. A “line link”, therefore, links two distinct places. Continuing on, an international submarine cable is defined (albeit for the purposes of that legislation) as “that part of a line link that is laid on or beneath the seabed that lies beneath Australian waters or for purposes that include connecting a place in Australia with a place outside Australia… and includes any device attached to that part of the line link… used in or in connection with the line link”.

Indian legislation, on the other hand, does not define a submarine cable. The term ‘international submarine cable’ has been used and defined in the “International Telecommunication Access to Essential Facilities at Cable Landing Stations Regulations 2007”, but has been defined using the term ‘submarine cable’ without elaborating on what it constitutes. Further this term has been used in the context of facilitating access of submarine cables to cable landing stations in India rather than ensuring their protection.

The closest that Indian legislation comes to addressing communication cables is “The Indian Telegraph Act 1885”. The broad definition of ‘telegraph’ as “any appliance, instrument, material or apparatus used or capable of use for transmission or reception of signs, signals, writing, images and sounds or intelligence of any nature by wire, visual or other electro-magnetic emissions, Radio waves or Hertzian waves, galvanic, electric or magnetic means”, read with the definition of a ‘telegraph line’ as a “wire or wires used for the purpose of a telegraph”, does seem to suggest that the 1885 Act may extend its application to the version of the communication cable evolved from the telegraph, the optical fibre cable which uses modified pulses of infrared light (an electro-magnetic emission) to carry data. This interpretation is supported by the completion of a domestic underwater optical fibre cable system from Chennai to Andaman & Nicobar Islands under the Universal Service Obligation Fund project set up under the 1885 Act.

However, the 1885 Act does not explicitly identify optical fibre submarine cables. This is hardly surprising, as the 1885 Act was conceptualised at a time long before the development of such a network, and its need within our society. Further there is no clarity whether it also includes ‘international’ submarine cables connecting India to places outside India. There has been an indication that the Department of Telecom’s optical fibre cable projects connecting India’s neighbouring countries would not fall under the USOF project. The focus of the USOF project, which uses funds appropriated from the Consolidated Fund of India, is to provide connectivity to the hinterlands and unconnected areas within India. Therefore, the present regime in India is far from being a dedicated regime for the protection of submarine cables connecting India to the rest of the world. The necessity for such a dedicated regime is highlighted below.

Of course, submarine cables are not limited to communications cables alone. Indeed, the term includes submarine communications cables as well as submarine power cables used to transmit power from one place to another. This article, however, concentrates upon submarine communication cables, which, taken in aggregate, form part of a network designed to transmit data from one place to another. This is schematically depicted in the article.

The cable network begins with an armoured submarine cable connected to a cable station, which contains the servers from/to which data is to be transmitted. Cables that are laid in depths shallower than 1,500 metres (m) are often buried some 60 cm under the seabed in order to prevent them from damage by ships working their anchors, or other activity such as mining and dredging. However, those laid in depths in excess of 1,500 m are not buried but simply laid upon the seabed, because the chance of accidental damage at such depths is unlikely.

In India, the opportunity to provide international telecommunication links was made available to the private sector in 2002 and private players could operate in this industry after being issued an appropriate license. These private players are known as International Long Distance (ILD) providers. Cable systems in India are currently owned almost uniformly by private operators, who also undertake operations associated with these systems. While there are currently 16 operational submarine cable systems in India, at least 4 additional cable systems are planned.

Two ownership models are prevalent in India, namely, private ownership and consortium-based ownership. A ‘private ownership model’, as the name suggests, refers to a system wherein the cable is constructed and managed by a single entity who sells the international capacity to other telecom operators. The ‘consortium model’, on the other hand, is one wherein a group of international operators form a club to fund, build, operate and own the cable system. The members of the consortium build the cable landing stations in their respective countries and lay cables in accordance with the agreement executed between them. The capacity on the cable is then allocated according to the financial contribution and responsibilities of the telecom operator. The article provides details of the cable systems existing in India as of 2021, with details of ownership and location.

For example, in the SEA-ME-WE 4 cable system, with Bharti Airtel and TCL as consortium members, TCL owns the landing station at Mumbai and would have laid the cables for that segment of the cable network, while Bharti Airtel owns the landing station in Chennai and probably laid the Chennai segment of the network. However, it is unclear whether the ownership is only of the landing station and the cable segment connecting it, or ownership extends to the entire cable network to the extent of the cable capacity allocated.

**Vulnerabilities and Threats**

Our interconnected, tech-enabled, globalised world, which allows for a message to be sent from India to the United States in ‘real time’, owes its existence to these physical cables travelling across continents. 97% of global communications are transmitted over 213 independent cable systems traversing 545,018 miles of fibre.","The article discusses submarine communication cables, their vulnerabilities, and their importance in global communications.

The underwater trans-Pacific cable that provides Internet to most of Southeast Asia broke again yesterday, leaving millions with slow or spotty connectivity. The region faces an estimated repair time of up to a month.

The Asia-America Gateway (AAG), launched in 2009, is an enormous underwater cable line stretching 12,000 miles across the Pacific. It connects 10 points throughout the Pacific islands and Southeast Asia and provides vital connectivity to several countries between Malaysia and California.

But one branch of the $500 million AAG has been continually beset with problems. The segment of the cable that runs between Vietnam and Hong Kong has ruptured four times within the last six months—twice near Hong Kong and twice near Vietnam. The latest incident occurred yesterday, when the cable broke near the Vietnamese city of Ba Ria.

In addition to Vietnam, the outage affects the cable’s offshoot points further west, which means Internet users in Brunei, Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia are also feeling the slow-down. Although these other countries rely on the cable, it is managed by one Vietnamese telecommunications company.

Investigators have not confirmed a reason for the latest rupture. One common explanation in these cases is that anchors from passing fishing trawlers snagged the cable and caused damage. Increasingly, however, cable watchers believe that the problem may be sharks.

Shark species in the region, these experts say, may be drawn to chow down on the cables, which send off electromagnetic waves that can act as sharkbait. One theory holds that sharks mistake the cables for the bioelectric fields surrounding schools of fish. Others suggest that perhaps sharks are merely overly curious.

Whatever the explanation, there are undoubtedly issues with sharks attacking undersea Internet cables. A surveillance camera attached to equipment reinforcing one of Google’s cables captured video of one such attack in August.

To prevent sharks from chomping through fragile and expensive fiber-optic wires, Google, which has pledged to collaborate on a similar $300 million undersea cable to Japan, has started wrapping its cables in kevlar.

It’s a smart plan, but it offers little in the way of comfort to frustrated Southeast Asians battling slow load times and month-long service outages.","The article titled 'Curious and confused sharks may be biting through Vietnam’s Internet cables' discusses the Asia-America Gateway undersea cable, which has experienced multiple ruptures affecting internet connectivity in Southeast Asia.

*By Marcia Wendorf*  
*Published Date: 02/27/2023*  
  
In July 2019, 14 Russian sailors onboard a submarine were killed in an accident. The top-secret submarine, believed to be the Losharik, was attempting to dock with a larger submarine when an explosion occurred in her battery compartment. Rather than evacuating, the 14 sailors closed a hatch and fought the resulting fire.  
  
The Losharik can operate at depths other submarines cannot reach, and Western intelligence agencies have speculated that her mission was to tap information flowing through undersea cables. These cables form the backbone of worldwide communications.  
  
The cables carry 95 percent of daily worldwide communications, plus they carry financial transactions worth over $10 trillion a day. Any disruption would cause a catastrophic cut in the flow of capital.  
  
Where these undersea cables come ashore are called ""landing areas,"" and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security lists these landing areas at the top of their list of ""critical infrastructure.""  
  
### Undersea Telegraph Cables  
  
The first undersea transcontinental telegraph cable was completed in the summer of 1858. It ran under the Atlantic ocean from Newfoundland to Ireland, and it carried the first official telegraph message sent by Queen Victoria to U.S. President James Buchanan. That 509-letter message took 17 hours and 40 minutes to arrive.  
  
Between the years 1858 and 1911, Britain's vast colonial empire required communication, and entrepreneurs in Britain financed the building, laying and maintenance of the first undersea telegraph cables.  
  
Telegraph communication meant that ships could be directed to pick up cargo, governors of the various colonies could be in contact with London, and Britain could coordinate her military units.  
  
During the 1860s and 1870s, Britain expanded her undersea cable telegraph network eastward into the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean. In 1870, a cable linking Bombay, India to London was completed by a consortium of four cable companies, and in 1872, these four companies combined to form the Eastern Telegraph Company.  
  
A spin-off company, the Eastern Extension China and Australasia Telegraph Company, was formed, and in 1876, it linked Australia, Bombay, Singapore, and China.  
  
In the Pacific Ocean, the U.S. linked to Hawaii in 1902, and that same year, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji were connected. Japan came on board in 1906.  
  
### Undersea Telephone Cables  
  
It wasn't until 1955 that the first transatlantic telephone cable, TAT-1, was laid between Oban, Scotland, and Clarenville, Newfoundland. It was inaugurated on September 25, 1956, and carried 36 telephone channels.  
  
### Undersea Fiber-Optic Cables  
  
The first fiber-optic cables were developed in the 1980s, and the first fiber-optic transatlantic telephone cable was TAT-8, which went into operation in 1988. Today's fiber-optic cables have their fibers arranged in a self-healing ring to increase redundancy, and their submarine sections follow different paths along the ocean floor. Some systems have dual landing points where they come onshore.  
  
Today, 99 percent of the data crossing the oceans is carried by undersea cables. As of 2012, data was flowing error-free at 100 Gbps across Atlantic Ocean routes of up to 6,000 km. That meant that a typical cable was capable of moving tens of terabits of data per second, with the fastest transatlantic connections taking less than 60 milliseconds (1/1,000 of a second).  
  
### Undersea Cables and National Security  
  
Britain's very first action after declaring war in World War I was to have the cable ship Alert cut the five undersea cables that linked Germany to France, Spain, the Azores, and North America.  
  
Today, the Pentagon is worried that ships like the Losharik appear to be accessing undersea cables at much greater depths, where the cables are harder to monitor and repair.  
  
### Cable Repair  
  
Cables can be broken by ship's anchors, fishing trawlers, earthquakes, currents, and even shark bites. To repair cable, repair ships either bring the entire cable to the surface or else they cut the cable and bring up only the damaged portion. Then, a new section is spliced in.  
  
### Antarctica  
  
Today, Antarctica remains the only continent not connected by a submarine telecommunications cable. Fiber-optic cable there would have to withstand temperatures of -80 degrees C (-112 degrees F) and the strain of flowing sea ice.","The article discusses the topic of undersea cables extensively, including their significance for global communications, historical incidents involving their disruption, and contemporary security threats posed by nations like the U.S. and Russia.

"Underwater Cable Damage Causes 60% Nationwide Internet Speed Drop","60% decrease in internet speed affecting 50% of Pakistan's traffic due to SEA-ME-WE 4 cable damage.","https://tribune.com.pk/story/527643/underwater-cable-damaged-internet-speed-plummets-by-60-nationwide","","farooq.baloch",Yes,"Farooq Baloch","Karachi, Pakistan","100000","2013-03-28","English","Express Digital Private Limited","**KARACHI:**

**Internet speed across Pakistan plummeted by nearly 60% on Wednesday when an underwater fiber optic cable was damaged in the Arabian Sea near Karachi.**

South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe (SEA-ME-WE) 4, one of the four submarine cables that connects the country globally via the internet, was damaged around noon on Wednesday – only a couple of weeks following the breakdown of India-Middle East-Western Europe (I-ME-WE) fiber optic cable that has yet to be repaired.

As a result, internet services in the country will likely remain disrupted for an indefinite period. Internet service providers were unable to provide a timeframe on when the problem will be resolved.

Shortly after the disruption, internet users across Pakistan faced a host of problems ranging from intermittent to slow internet connectivity. Many complained that their browsing speed had decreased significantly.

“This is a result of a fault in the undersea cable line to Pakistan through Alexandria, Egypt. The fiber optic undersea cable SEA-ME-WE-4 was affected beyond Egypt for currently unknown reasons,” Wateen Telecom said in a statement.

The fault disrupted about 50% of Pakistan’s internet traffic, according to Wahaj-us-Siraj, Convener of Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan (ISPAK). The network breakdown has affected over a dozen countries, he said.

Explaining further, the ISPAK chief said Transworld Associates (TWA) and Pakistan Telecommunications Company Limited (PTCL) act as the internet gateway to Pakistan and provide bandwidth to local internet service providers. TWA and PTCL are connected with four undersea fiber optic cables that include I-ME-WE, SEA-ME-WE-3, SEA-ME-WE-4 and TWA-1.

The country’s internet traffic is currently running on SEA-ME-WE-3and TWA-1 and catering to the entire telecommunications traffic, which has caused massive traffic congestion, Siraj said.

The breakdown of SEA-ME-WE-4, however, has caused more problems than I-ME-WE.

“It’s like you have four roads catering to the traffic; what will happen if two of these roads are closed,” Wahaj said.

“The estimated time to repair has not been announced as of yet, as PTCL and TWA are in communication with SEA-ME-WE-4 consortium members to determine the time it will take to repair the cable,” Wateen Telecom added.

SEA-ME-WE 4 provides a telecommunications link between Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Egypt, Italy, Tunisia, Algeria and France.

The cable is approximately 18,800 kilometres long, and provides the primary internet backbone between South East Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East and Europe.

_Published in The Express Tribune, March 28th, 2013._","The article titled 'Underwater cable damaged: Internet speed plummets by 60 nationwide' discusses the damage to the SEA-ME-WE 4 undersea fiber optic cable in the Arabian Sea, which directly falls under the topic of cut sea cables.

Other countries had enough terrestrial cable and satellite connections to route around the downed cable, but they still saw significant disruptions in internet access for most of the weekend.

Outages like this rarely make the headlines, but it’s a good reminder of exactly how fragile much of the internet’s infrastructure still is — particularly in places like West Africa. When a major cable gets cut, every other connection has to strain to pick up the slack. When there’s no other infrastructure to rely on, connectivity simply drops out. Lacking investment, the internet becomes less reliable for the entire region.

This is the problem that projects like Alphabet’s balloons and Facebook’s solar drones are trying to solve, at least in theory. But in practical terms, all that’s really needed is more cables and landing points — the kind of thing Nigeria has but Mauritania doesn’t. And after years of moonshot development, we still don’t have many options when a cable gets cut.","The article titled ""A broken submarine cable knocked Mauritania off the internet for two days"" directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables by detailing the incident involving the ACE Submarine cable that was cut, resulting in significant connectivity issues for Mauritania and other West African countries.

A clock in South Africa is counting down the seconds until a pair of broken cables are expected to go back in service. Every few hours, the service provider TENET, which keeps South Africa's university and research facilities connected to the global Internet, tweets updates.

The eight-year-old West Africa Cable System (WACS) submarine cable, which runs parallel to Africa's west coast, broke at two points early on 16 January. That same day, an 18-year-old cable called SAT-3 that runs along the same route also broke.

Cable breaks, whether due to accidents or sabotage, are well-known risks, so most Internet service providers lease capacity on alternate routes as a backup. Internet speeds in South Africa dropped after the break, but most services had backups and were able to maintain connections.

TENET restored its overseas connections by switching to an alternative 80-gigabit-per-second service on the SEACOM and EASSy cables on Africa's east coast. ""The latency ... increased due to this failover, but there are currently no reported issues of this being detrimental to connectivity,"" a representative of TENET said.

The likely cause of the breaks was an undersea earthquake of magnitude 5.6 that took place off Ascension Island. The failures were in Congo Canyon, which extends about 200 kilometers west from the mouth of the Congo River.

Most South African carriers had route diversity, with capacity available on two or more cables. One, Afrihost, had the bad luck of picking the SAT-3 cable as its main backup to the WACS cable. ""It was unprecedented that two completely geographically separate cables run by completely separate companies would fail within hours of each other,"" Afrihost CEO Gian Visser told Business Times.

Repairing the breaks requires sending a specially equipped cable ship to the site. Fortunately, one of them, the Leon Thevenin, was in Cape Town Harbor at the time of the breaks. After loading equipment, it sailed on 22 January with a crew of 54. TENET reported the ship reached the site of the breaks late on 28 January, and is now tweeting reports of repairs.

A new generation of submarine cables is in the works, including four expected to reach South Africa in the next three years, each designed to provide more capacity than the present six cables combined now provide. Google Cloud plans to complete the Equiano cable from Portugal to South Africa by 2021; it will have about 20 times the transmission capacity of the most recent cable connected to Africa.

Meanwhile, the South Atlantic Express 1 and 2 cables are expected to begin service in 2022, with design capacities of 108 and 72 terabits per second.

Telecommunications company Reliance Globalcom has announced the results of its investigation into a rash of cable cuts that occurred earlier this year. According to the company via _The Hindu_, two merchant vessels, the MV Hounslow, and the MT Ann, were responsible for damage that crippled both India and the Middle East's internet access for weeks.

The company's findings do not, in and of themselves, explain all the cable cuts that occurred in late January/early February, but they do indicate that the timing and placement of the breaks was coincidental. Reliance Globalcom reached its conclusions by studying satellite imagery of the two vessels and their movements over the time period in question. These findings were presumably referenced against the evidence collected by the repair crews that were sent to examine and repair the broken cables.

Both the MV Hounslow and the MT Ann were impounded upon reaching Dubai. One of the two—it's not clear which—has already been released after its Korean owners agreed to pay an unstated amount of compensation. The other, Iraqi-owned, ship is in a bit more trouble, however, and sailors on the vessel may be taken to court.","The article discusses undersea cable cuts in detail, including direct mentions of 'undersea cable cuts' and the implications for internet connectivity in India and the Middle East.

The damage was more extensive than originally thought. The cable was probably damaged by a ship’s anchor.**

According to Energinet, the power connection between Bornholm and Sweden was restarted at 18.03 on Saturday, March 26, and the island can be supplied with electricity from outside again.

One of three cables connecting infrastructure in the town of Hasle in Bornholm to Borreby in Sweden was severed on Saturday, February 26 at 6.17, causing a power cut throughout Bornholm. Energinet immediately sent special units to the site to find the cause and begin repairing the cable. While the submarine cable was broken, Bornholm was supplied with electricity from its own generation sources.

Ship Silja spent the first few days surveying the seabed to determine the location and cause of the fault. Ship Vina then secured the cable, which is normally buried in the seabed, to increase its protection from anchors or trawls, for example. Assister repair vessel then lifted the cable onto the ship’s deck, where the ends of the cable were connected to a spare cable installed between them.

While repairing the cable, other parts of the cable were also found to have obvious damage from anchors, trawls, etc. The old damage, which had not previously caused problems, was severe enough that these sections of cable also needed to be replaced. Consequently, more cable was needed than the approximately 3.3 km wrapped on the first cable drum. A total of 4.1 km of marine cable was cut and replaced with 4.25 km of new cable – the replacement section has to be longer because the cable failure occurred in water depths of approx. 50 m, and the repair is done on the sea surface.

Later investigations showed that the cable was probably pulled through the ship’s anchor. The vessel that was passing over the cable when the failure occurred has been identified and Energinet has initiated insurance proceedings.

If compensation is paid from the ship’s insurance, the sum insured depends on, among other things, the size of the vessel. If the costs exceed the insurance cover compensation, the rest of the costs are paid by Energinet, sp ultimately the Danish electricity consumers.","The article titled 'Energinet has repaired cable connection between Bornholm and Sweden' discusses a severed submarine cable that was damaged by a ship's anchor.

An undersea fibre optic cable between Latvia and Sweden was damaged on Sunday, likely as a result of external influence, Latvia said, triggering an investigation by local and NATO maritime forces in the Baltic Sea.  

""We have determined that there is most likely external damage and that it is significant,"" Latvian Prime Minister Evika Silina told reporters following an extraordinary government meeting.  

Latvia is coordinating with NATO and the countries of the Baltic Sea region to clarify the circumstances, she said separately in a post on social media.  

Latvia's navy earlier on Sunday said it had dispatched a patrol boat to inspect a ship and that two other vessels were also subject to investigation.  

Up to several thousand commercial vessels make their way through the Baltic Sea at any given time, and a number of them passed the broken cable on Sunday, data from the MarineTraffic ship tracking service showed.  

One such ship, the Malta-flagged bulk carrier Vezhen, was closely followed by a Swedish coast guard vessel on Sunday evening, MarineTraffic data showed, and the two were heading in toward the southern Swedish coastline.  

It was not immediately clear if the Vezhen, which passed the fibre optic cable at 00:45 GMT on Sunday, was subject to investigation.  

A Swedish coastguard spokesperson declined to comment on the Vezhen or the position of coastguard ships.  

""We are in a stage where we cannot give any information,"" the spokesperson said. ""Exactly how we are involved we cannot say.""  

Bulgarian shipping company Navigation Maritime Bulgare, which listed the Vezhen among its fleet, did not immediately reply when called and emailed by Reuters outside of office hours.  

**NATO cooperation**  

Swedish Navy spokesperson Jimmie Adamsson earlier told Reuters it was too soon to say what caused the damage to the cable or whether it was intentional or a technical fault.  

""NATO ships and aircrafts are working together with national resources from the Baltic Sea countries to investigate and, if necessary, take action,"" the alliance said in a statement on Sunday.  

Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said his country was cooperating closely with NATO and Latvia.  

""Sweden will contribute important capabilities to the ongoing effort to investigate the suspected incident,"" Kristersson said on social media.  

NATO said last week it would deploy frigates, patrol aircraft and naval drones in the Baltic Sea to help protect critical infrastructure and reserved the right to take action against ships suspected of posing a security threat.  

The military alliance is taking the action, dubbed ""Baltic Sentry"", following a string of incidents in which power cables, telecom links and gas pipelines have been damaged in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.  

Finnish police last month seized a tanker carrying Russian oil and said they suspected the vessel had damaged the Finnish-Estonian Estlink 2 power line and four telecoms cables by dragging its anchor across the seabed.  

Finland's prime minister in a statement said the latest cable damage highlighted the need to increase protection for critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea.  

The cable that broke on Sunday linked the Latvian town of Ventspils with Sweden's Gotland island, and was damaged in Sweden's exclusive economic zone, the Latvian Navy said.  

Communications providers were able to switch to alternative transmission routes, the cable's operator, Latvian State Radio and Television Centre (LVRTC), said in a statement, adding it was seeking to contract a vessel to begin repairs.  

""The exact nature of the damage can only be determined once cable repair work begins,"" LVRTC said.  

A spokesperson for the operator said the cable, laid at depths of more than 50 metres (164 feet), was damaged on early Sunday but declined to give an exact time of the incident.  

Unlike seabed gas pipelines and power cables, which can take many months to repair after damage, fibre optic cables that have suffered damage in the Baltic Sea have generally been restored within weeks.  

A Swedish Post and Telecom Authority spokesperson said it was aware of the situation but had no further comment.

**Author:** Tom Whipple  
**Published Date:** 06/14/2023  
  
On the morning of Thursday October 20 last year, the Shetland Islands very suddenly and without warning left the 21st century.  
Somewhere on the sea bed between them and the mainland, a trawler had accidentally pulled up a fibre optic cable and now the internet and landlines were down. The islands were once again alone in the blustery North Sea. It would be days before services were fully restored.  
For many residents, what was surprising was the fragility of their connection to the modern world and the ease with which it was severed. Those in the military would have been less surprised.  
Almost all internet data travels, ultimately, by cable. There are 60 cables that connect the UK to the rest of the world. Only 200 cables around the world carry 95 percent of all internet traffic. Each day they also carry $10 trillion of financial transactions. They meet at a small handful of critical nodes, one of which is the UK.  
For most of their length these cables just lie on the sea bed — the arteries of modern commerce exposed to the ocean above. Their vulnerability has not gone unnoticed. If it is possible to blow up Nord Stream gas pipelines, defence chiefs argue, it is certainly possible to cut something only slightly thicker than a fat garden hose.  
Last year the Ministry of Defence warned of “increased opportunities for adversaries to threaten western subsea critical national infrastructure”. A year earlier it said that Russia was one of the adversaries developing the technology to do just this.  
The European parliament made it even more explicit, cautioning about the “potential for sabotaging undersea cables during times of conflict”. In particular, it noted: “Some countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, or Egypt, have a particularly important position in the international cable system, acting as connecting points between political regions.”  
Ultimately, the task of cutting a cable is a lot simpler than the task of protecting a cable. As Lawrence of Arabia demonstrated with his attacks on the railways of the Ottoman Empire, long communications lines in unpopulated areas are extremely vulnerable. The defender must guard the whole length, the attacker can choose just one point.  
We are not defenceless, however. Royal Navy submarines can monitor underwater activity, and from this year a new ship, the RFA Proteus, will enter service tasked with guarding critical undersea infrastructure. It will act as a mother ship for autonomous vehicles that can inspect and defend cables and pipelines. It will also act as a statement of intent.

*By: Phoenix*  
In October of 2023, Phoenix was contacted by the Ocean Cables and Unmanned Systems Division of the Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (EXWC) to develop an innovative approach to repair the Kaneohe Wave Energy Test Site (WETS) 60M Berth Electro-Opto-Mechanical Cable. Due to the dynamic shoreline environment, the cable had sustained damage along the shore landing riprap. This time sensitive repair was critical to support Wave Energy Converter (WEC) deployment schedules and other site initiatives.  
  
The WETS deep water system contains two cables. One servicing the 80M Berth and the second servicing the 60M Berth. WETS Kaneohe was the first grid connected wave energy test site installed in U.S. waters.  
  
In March 2024, Phoenix received approval to commence the repair and mobilization was initiated. The star asset of this project was a 50-ft by 60-ft modular jack up barge. This barge was outfitted with a Phoenix Palfinger crane, custom cable chutes, 10k winches, a shallow water dive spread and other miscellaneous repair support equipment. The jack up barge provided a stable and reliable work platform on a site known for unfavorable nearshore working conditions.  
  
Once the barge was on site operations commenced. The shore end of the damaged cable was repaired by way of splicing in a new section of cable to the existing offshore leg from the jack up barge positioned offshore in 17-feet of salt water. Approximately 1089-linear feet of cable was pulled offshore with the barge mounted winch. The new cable was spooled off the flatbed mounted power reel to a stand on shore. Cable floats were added at the mean high-water mark as the pull progressed. Both the existing offshore cable and new shore end were jointed in a submersible splice box provided and accomplished by Marmon Utility (Cable OEM). Once jointing and initial testing was complete, the splice box was deployed, and both the cable omega loops, and splice box were fastened to the seabed. The shore end was routed, connected at the beach vault, and final testing satisfactorily completed.  
  
Commenting on the successful completion of the project, Travis Niederhauser, Phoenix Hawaii Area Manager stated, “We are humbled that EXWC entrusted Phoenix to plan and execute this highly visible project. Phoenix personnel, consultants, subcontractors, and suppliers all performed to the highest standard. We are grateful for their support.”

Data cables are turning into economic and strategic assets.  
  
WHEN THE navies of Britain, Estonia and Finland held a joint exercise in the Baltic Sea earlier this month, their goal was not to hone warfighting skills. Instead, the forces were training to protect undersea gas and data pipelines from sabotage. The drills followed events in October when submarine cables in the region were damaged. Sauli Niinisto, the Finnish president, wondered whether the Chinese ship blamed for the mischief dragged its anchor on the ocean bed ""intentionally or as a result of extremely poor seamanship"".  
  
Submarine cables used to be seen as the internet’s dull plumbing. Now giants of the data economy, such as Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft, are asserting more control over the flow of data, even as tensions between China and America risk splintering the world’s digital infrastructure. The result is to turn undersea cables into prized economic and strategic assets.  

This article appeared in the Business section of the print edition under the headline “4,000 terabits under the sea”.","The article titled ""Big tech and geopolitics are reshaping the internet’s plumbing"" discusses the strategic importance of submarine cables, particularly in the context of a recent incident where cables in the Baltic Sea were damaged.

France Telecom has reported today that 3 major underwater cables were cut: “Sea Me We 4” at 7:28am, “Sea Me We3” at 7:33am and FLAG at 8:06am. The causes of the cut, which is located in the Mediterranean between Sicily and Tunisia, on sections linking Sicily to Egypt, remain unclear.

Most of the B to B traffic between Europe and Asia is rerouted through the USA. Traffic from Europe to Algeria and Tunisia is not affected, but traffic from Europe to the Near East and Asia is interrupted to a greater or lesser extent.

Three undersea cables – Sea Me We3 partly, Sea Me We4 and FLAG – cut in the morning hours of December 19, 2008, causing significant Internet access disruptions between Europe and Asia/Near East zone. 

Part of the internet traffic towards Réunion is affected as well as 50% towards Jordan. A first appraisal at 7:44 am UTC gave an estimate of the following impact on the voice traffic (in percentage of out of service capacity):

* Saudi Arabia: 55% out of service

In the tense relationship between Russia and the United States, the latest salvo comes via _The New York Times_: According to American military and intelligence officials, Russian submarines and spy ships are ""aggressively operating"" near submarine cables that carry Internet communications, raising concerns of a potential attack ""in times of tension or conflict.""

The submarine cables are obscure, yet incredibly vital infrastructure that basically carries most of the communications around the world. Descendants of the old telegraph networks, fiber-optic data cables snake across the bottom of the oceans, linking continents to each other and shuttling the vast majority of all voice and data traffic.

The _Times_ report presents an account from unnamed military and intelligence officials that Russia's naval activities along the known cable routes are raising concerns in the Pentagon:

> ""The ultimate Russian hack on the United States could involve severing the fiber-optic cables at some of their hardest-to-access locations to halt the instant communications on which the West's governments, economies and citizens have grown dependent.""

This would be a new kind of spy operation. In the past, cables have been known to be tapped for secrets, but cutting the cables is a whole different thing.

""You'd need a lot of submarines to actually harm a country like the United States,"" says Keith Schofield, general manager of the International Cable Protection Committee, whose members collectively oversee almost all of the world's intercontinental submarine cables.

Actually, one submarine per each cable, says Tim Stronge, researcher at TeleGeography, which tracks the commercial submarine cable industry. He says the cables run closer when they're near the shore but track different paths, especially out in the ocean.

The reason is that each cable alone, while hugely important to the company that owns it, isn't detrimental to your Internet connection.

""Normally, the traffic is diverted if a cable is cut, because clearly any commercial operator wants to ensure their customers still have service ... . And so the traffic is just automatically re-routed to a good route,"" Schofield tells All Tech.

""It's a bit like saying, 'We're going to intercept every interstate highway in the United States, all at the same time, then you'd have a problem with traffic.' If you intercept one, or two, or 10, you can still reroute around it.""

Stronge also says that much of what regular users look for online, like videos and searches and websites, is hosted domestically and would remain unaffected even in the event of every single U.S.-connected cable going black.

The industry is built to be robust; it's built for failure. Typically, the owners of the cable systems have to deal with cuts near the shore, caused by fishers or dragging anchors. The cables in shallow waters are often especially armored for those threats. Far in the ocean, they're just tiny fiber-optic wires inside a plastic tube, and rarely get disrupted (usually in natural disasters like earthquakes).

It costs anywhere from tens of thousands to $1 million or more to lift a deep-sea cable from the bottom of the ocean and work on it. That means serious financial costs would be involved in repairing potential damage, but also costs involved in an attack of this sort.

Schofield says the safety of cable network systems is hugely important: ""The world's submarine cable telecoms infrastructure is vital; it's the heartbeat of the Internet."" But he says it would have to be a ""consistent, sustained and diverse"" attack to cause a severe problem.

What if it does?

""Let's say some foreign entity, some evil doer, like a James Bond villain, cut every single undersea fiber-optic cable connection to the United States,"" says Stronge, ""well, we do still have satellite.""","The article titled ""What Would It Take To Cut U.S. Data Cables And Halt Internet Access?"" by Alina Selyukh discusses submarine cables and their significance in internet connectivity.

**Published Date:** 11/06/2023  

The scope of damage from a suspected anchor-dragging incident involving a Chinese ship in the Baltic may have been larger than previously reported, according to Finland’s Ministry of Economic Affairs. In addition to a ruptured gas pipeline and two damaged telecom cables connecting three NATO member states, a Russian fiber-optic cable was also reported damaged during roughly the same timeframe, the ministry revealed Monday.

The Balticconnector gas pipeline from Finland to Estonia, an adjacent telecom cable and a second cable from Estonia to Sweden were all damaged in the early hours of October 8. The government of Finland believes that the rupture was caused by ""external"" forces, and a dragged anchor is the primary culprit. Post-accident investigations found a miles-long drag trail leading up to the pipeline, a broken anchor at the damage site, and a smaller drag trail the size of an anchor stock leading away.

Finnish authorities initially suspected a saboteur with a ""certain amount of know-how and special equipment,"" and though not stated explicitly, all eyes turned to Russia. The Russian government had already threatened to take ""military-technical"" steps to retaliate against Finland for joining NATO in April, and it has extensive capabilities for subsea espionage and sabotage.

However, the more recent evidence points to a Chinese-owned ship, the NewNew Polar Bear. The vessel crossed the pipeline at the location of the damage site, and at about the same moment that a faint seismic event was detected near that position. It was later photographed arriving in Archangelsk with what appeared to be an empty port side hawsepipe, missing one anchor.

The NewNew Polar Bear's crew refused to cooperate with investigators, and the ship has long since departed. Finnish authorities are still working to determine whether the damage was intentional.

On Monday, Finland’s Ministry of Economic Affairs reported that a Russian telecom cable was also damaged in the same area, at roughly the same time. The operator of the Baltika cable, Rostelcom, asked for permission to carry out a repair in Finnish waters on October 12, four days after the incident.

How engineers will repair the undersea communications cable severed by the recent volcanic eruption.  
  
The South Pacific nation of Tonga was all but cut off from the world after an undersea communications cable was severed following the massive eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano on January 15. The blackout caused major disruption to aid efforts following the disaster.  
  
Limited satellite connectivity has provided some relief but communication remains difficult as some outlying islands are still cut off. Tonga signed a 15-year deal to secure satellite connectivity following an earlier cable break in 2019 from a ship's anchor. But the use of satellite phones has been affected by the volcanic ash blanketing the country. Some people have reported they can only dial out - and not receive calls.  
  
A specialist ship is en route to the area to restore the cable. The ship left Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, about 4,700 km (2,900 miles) away, on January 20 and is expected to reach the area on January 30. The operation is expected to take a few weeks.  
  
The 827 km (514 miles) cable from Fiji to Tonga is one of 436 active undersea cables that connect the globe. It was not until five days after the volcanic eruption that the country’s major telecom operators could establish a connection to the global internet via satellite, according to network monitoring company Kentik.  
  
However, the capacity of satellite-based internet is greatly constrained. “Satellite service in the Pacific is expensive because of the vast coverage area and relatively small population,” said Doug Madory, a network analyst at Kentik.  
  
Tonga’s cable was laid in 2013 at a cost of $15 million. The World Bank and Asian Development Bank extended grants to help it overcome reliance on expensive satellite-based communication.  
  
Undersea communication cables can vary in size and structure but are roughly the diameter of a garden hose. Although relatively thin, these cables have multiple layers protecting the fibre optic cable at the centre. Despite layers of protection and avoiding accident prone areas, on average, there are 100 cable faults recorded every year according to Telegeography, a telecommunications research firm.  
  
Most cable damage occurs due to ship anchors or fishing trawlers and occasionally environmental factors such as earthquakes.  
  
According to Jonathan Brewer, a telecommunications engineer, it's better to have multiple cables or multiple cable landing stations to manage the risk of disruption. However, this can be expensive. Pacific islands like Guam and French Polynesia have significant support from the U.S. and French governments enabling them to have such extensive infrastructure.  
  
The repair ship, CS Reliance, is one of six identical ones owned by SubCom, an undersea cable laying company.  
  
Most of these cables have an approximate life span of about 25 years and are usually retired and replaced with newer ones. Some are salvaged for their raw materials that can be repurposed.  
  
Although telephone links between Tonga and the wider world have begun to be reconnected, restoring full internet connectivity is likely to take a month or more according to the owner of the archipelago's sole subsea communications cable.","The article titled ""The race to reconnect Tonga"" discusses the severing of an undersea communications cable due to the volcanic eruption of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai.

"Undersea Data Cables Vulnerable to Sabotage","Examines incidents of cable cutting, including a 2007 event affecting internet connectivity, revealing significant risks to undersea data infrastructure.","https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news-features/all-at-sea","","Danny Bradbury",Yes,"Danny Bradbury","Richmond, Surrey, United Kingdom",-,"2023-02-06","English","Infosecurity Magazine","When you watch Netflix, deal with your email or make a Skype call, the traffic travels along a relatively small number of routes to its destination. Like most of the world’s internet traffic, it travels via submarine cables, typically the width of a garden hose. Today, there are 356 of these cables spread across the world. How safe are they from attack or disruption?

These cables run between continents, channelling terabits of information down a single fibre-optic link. They are incredibly expensive to build, with a transatlantic link costing around $500 million, and only a handful of firms have the ability to lay them.

Laying the cables is a tricky business. Out in deep ocean waters, there are few threats to the integrity of a cable, and cable-laying ships will simply let them fall unprotected to the sea floor. As the cables get closer to the shore, though, the ocean bed becomes shallower, and more threatening. Wayward anchors can easily sever a cable. Consequently, for several miles before they come ashore they’re protected by strong metal sheathing. When they hit land, they’ll typically connect to land-based fibre cables in trenches protected by manhole covers or in anonymous-looking concrete shacks.

There are two kinds of potential attack on the submarine cable system. The first involves denial of service by disruption.

Information about cable locations is documented by several organizations including the National Oceanographic Data Center (DMA/NOAA) in the US and the UK’s Admiralty Hydrographic Office. If a cable’s ingress point is relatively unprotected, then wouldn’t a determined adversary be able to disrupt internet service – and therefore key parts of the critical national infrastructure – by simply blowing one up?

It’s a risk, admits Tim Stronge, vice president of research at telecommunications research firm TeleGeography. In the deep sea, attackers are effectively targeting a piece of garden hose. “At the beach, it might be a little harder but a determined adversary could damage where the cable comes in or they could damage or blow up a facility where the traffic is exchanged,” he says.

There are a handful of cases in which cables have been cut intentionally. In 2007, fishing trawlers near Vietnam did just that, pilfering 61 miles of undersea cables for copper content, taking out cables in southeast Asia for several months in the process.

The answer to these risks is safety in numbers, argues Stronge. In many developed countries, multiple cables land in different parts of the country. If one cable were to be disrupted, then there would be others that could take up the slack.

“The fact that the cable breaks a lot and Americans and Europeans hardly hear about it is because there is so much failover,” he says.

Some undersea cables are also structured with their own redundancy, Stronge points out. The Southern Cross cable that connects the US with Australia was laid in a built-in redundant ring formation that can fail over in the event of a break, he says.

Keith Schofield, general manager of the International Cable Protection Committee, adds that many submarine cables have far more capacity, thanks to technologies that make the capacity upgradable by enhancing equipment at either end.

“It’s rare for those cables to be full on day one”, he says. So if one cable is cut, another can take up the slack.

How many cables would an attacker have to sever to bring down a country’s internet? It depends on the region. Southeast Asia in particular is constrained by two things. First, it faces a lack of diversity. Lots of licensees want the same routes to minimise latency, resulting in high concentrations of traffic, and the cables are clustered into choke points. A 2016 Verizon report identified historically proven single points of failure in this region and across the north and eastern coast of Africa.

The second constraint in the Indian ocean concerns national policy. There are a finite number of repair ships that can hoist cable from the sea floor and repair it using splicing equipment. In some regions, such as Indonesia, a ‘cabotage’ policy that favours locally-owned vessels can hold up repairs. That is gradually changing, says Schofield.

“Now, nations are beginning to realise that it’s not in their citizen’s interest to restrict access to the Internet,” he says.

More generally, situations have arisen where it has taken time for a vessel to become available and get to the repair point. The more outages that happen at once, the greater the overhead on the repair assets. A concerted attack could theoretically cause significant problems.

**Submarine snooping**

The second kind of attack is more covert: tapping the cables directly to snoop on information. This has been done domestically, says Telegeography’s Stronge, because the Snowden files tell us so. BLARNEY and FAIRVIEW were all data gathering projects which involved “collection of communications on fiber cables and infrastructure as data flows past,” according to a leaked NSA document. These could just as easily be harvested with the operators’ collaboration, which has happened on several occasions.

What about foreign governments snooping on a nation state’s cable operation? Would it be possible to splice the cable using the same equipment used to repair it? It would be difficult, argues ICPC’s Schofield, because operators would sense differences in signals on a tapped line. However, the US has equipped military vessels such as the SS Jimmy Carter with cable splicing mechanisms in the past.

**Need for international governance**

We shouldn’t overcook the risks associated with undersea cable, warn experts, but they are there. This is why the ICPC earlier this year identified several security gaps that should be filled. It wants tighter laws to punish intentional cable destruction in international waters, because currently, few if any penalties exist. Penalties for destroying cables inside national waters are also woefully mild, Schofield adds.

Nations should cut through the red tape, getting rid of “cabotage” and other restrictions, to expedite the repair process, he added.

Finally, co-ordination is key, he warns. He wants desktop-style exercises between the ICPC and multiple states to play out procedures for repairing cables. At a national level, he wants countries including the US to overcome the ‘too many cooks’ problem. Several government agencies have jurisdiction over some element of submarine cables, but there is no one agency with total oversight. That impedes co-ordinated protection of the cable ecosystem, he warns, adding that Australia and Singapore have rationalized submarine cable control with effective results.

It would take a concerted attack on the cable infrastructure to make a dent in it. After all, the internet itself was designed to route itself around damage. But the risks are there. While the authorities work slowly to improve its resilience, some countries are taking ownership themselves. Facebook and Microsoft are both laying their own cable, and Google’s is already live. That represents yet another layer of vertical integration for these hyperscale firms – and just a little more peace of mind.","The article discusses undersea cables, focusing on their vulnerabilities to cuts and sabotage.

"Modernizing Outdated Laws for Undersea Cables","Discusses the urgent need to update laws governing undersea cables, citing the disruption of Tonga's connectivity due to a cable break linked to a volcanic eruption.","https://gcaptain.com/outdated-laws-governing-undersea-cables-need-modernizing","","Editorial",Yes,"Author: Editorial","Morro Bay, California, United States.","10000","2022-01-30","English","gCaptain","**Outdated Laws Governing Undersea Cables Need Modernizing**  
Karen Scott, The Conversation – Since the catastrophic volcanic eruption on January 16, Tonga has been largely cut off from the world due to a break in the undersea cable that links Tonga with Fiji (and from there with the world). A complete fix may take weeks.  
Aside from the distress and inconvenience this is causing, Tonga’s predicament demonstrates a more general vulnerability of our global communication system.  
Over 95% of the world’s data travels along the 436 submarine cables – around 1.3 million kilometres long in total – that connect all continents except Antarctica. These cables carry data integral to the internet, communication, and financial and defence systems worldwide.  
There are natural hazards, as the Tonga eruption so graphically demonstrated. But the greatest threat to submarine cables is from fishing. Despite the cables being clearly marked on maritime charts, about 70% of damage is caused accidentally by gear such as trawl nets, dredges, long lines and fish aggregation devices.  
But there is also concern that the cables are increasingly vulnerable to terrorism and cyberwarfare by private and state actors. As the head of the UK’s armed forces warned very recently:  
_Russian submarine activity is threatening underwater cables that are crucial to communication systems around the world._  
Tonga is connected to the world by a single cable, roughly the width of a garden hose, that carries optic fibers across the ocean bed. After a volcanic eruption severed that connection, the nation faces weeks of digital darkness.  
**An outdated convention**  
Given their fundamental importance to modern global communication, then, it would be natural to assume the international rules protecting submarine cables have been revised to respond to new technology and new challenges.  
Not so. The international legal regime for protecting and managing submarine cables has remained largely unchanged since 1884 when the Convention for the Protection of Submarine Telegraph Cables was adopted. It remains in force today, with 36 party states (including New Zealand and Australia, which acceded in 1888 and 1901 respectively).  
The convention makes it an offence to break or damage a submarine cable, wilfully or by culpable negligence (unless such action is necessary to save life). It also provides that only the state within which a vessel is registered (the “flag state”) can take action against its vessels and those on board.  
If the owner of a cable breaks or damages another cable when laying or repairing their own, they must bear the cost of repairing the breakage or damage. Vessel owners who sacrifice an anchor, net or other fishing gear to avoid damaging a cable can receive compensation from the owner of the cable.  
Cable-laying ships navigate complex but outdated maritime laws.  
**Who controls a cable?**  
These provisions go back to not long after the first international submarine communication cable was laid between Britain and France in 1850 – it was destroyed by a French fishing vessel within 24 hours.  
By 1858, the age of submarine cables and international communication had begun with the laying of the first transatlantic cable connecting Britain and the US, although it failed after about a month and was replaced in 1866.  
In 1902, the so-called “All Red” route linked New Zealand and Australia with Vancouver through the Pacific Ocean and on to Europe through the Trans-Canada and Atlantic lines.  
In 1986, the first fibre optic cable was laid between the UK and Belgium, beginning the modern revolution in global communication.  
The 19th-century principles governing undersea cables have since been incorporated into the modern law of the sea, codified by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), ratified by 168 nations.  
Under UNCLOS all states have a right to lay cables and pipelines on the seabed and continental shelf up to the 12 nautical mile limit. To run a cable to shore through another state’s territorial sea, a state needs the permission of the coastal state.  
But beyond the territorial sea, the power of the coastal state to prevent or impose conditions on where a cable is laid is extremely limited. The 1884 convention rules relating to offences and liability have been incorporated into UNCLOS with minimal amendment.  
**Time for modern laws**  
There are a number of problems with the current rules. First, outside of the territorial sea, the only state that can take action against a vessel that breaks a cable is the vessel’s own flag state.  
While some flag states are responsible and have adopted appropriate legislation – as New Zealand has done with the Submarine Cables and Pipelines Protection Act 1996 – many others have not.  
Moreover, the state with an interest in the cable – through ownership or because the cable ultimately connects to its shore – is normally not able take action against a vessel damaging the cable.  
Generally, the law does not address issues such as physical separation between different cables or their distance from other undersea activities such as mining. Nor does it cover maintaining consistent information on maritime charts, or co-ordination between industries and states.  
The International Cable Protection Committee, a private organisation comprising 180 state and commercial members representing 97% of the world’s submarine telecom cables, issued a voluntary guide to best practice in 2021 that addressed some of these issues – but is this enough?  
Given the potentially catastrophic impact on communications, the economy and defence of losing major cables to accident or nefarious activity, the answer is arguably no. The rules, largely unchanged since 1884, need modernising.","The article titled 'Outdated Laws Governing Undersea Cables Need Modernizing' provides a comprehensive discussion on undersea cables, specifically focusing on the implications of their damage, including a direct mention of the break in the undersea cable that links Tonga to Fiji following a volcanic eruption.

It states, 'Tonga has been largely cut off from the world due to a break in the undersea cable that links Tonga with Fiji.' This incident illustrates the central theme of the article regarding the vulnerabilities of undersea cables and their critical role in global communication.

Behind these everyday miracles lies an unseen, sprawling web of undersea cables, quietly powering the instant global communications that people have come to rely on.

Undersea cables, also known as submarine communications cables, are fiber-optic cables laid on the ocean floor and used to transmit data between continents. These cables are the backbone of the global internet, carrying the bulk of international communications, including email, webpages and video calls. More than 95% of all the data that moves around the world goes through these undersea cables.

These cables are capable of transmitting multiple terabits of data per second, offering the fastest and most reliable method of data transfer available today. A terabit per second is fast enough to transmit about a dozen two-hour, 4K HD movies in an instant. Just one of these cables can handle millions of people watching videos or sending messages simultaneously without slowing down.

About 485 undersea cables totaling over 900,000 miles sit on the ocean floor. These cables span the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, as well as strategic passages such as the Suez Canal and isolated areas within oceans.

Each undersea cable contains multiple optical fibers, thin strands of glass or plastic that use light signals to carry vast amounts of data over long distances with minimal loss. The fibers are bundled and encased in protective layers designed to withstand the harsh undersea environment, including pressure, wear and potential damage from fishing activities or ship anchors. The cables are typically as wide as a garden hose.

The process of laying undersea cables starts with thorough seabed surveys to chart a map in order to avoid natural hazards and minimize environmental impact. Following this step, cable-laying ships equipped with giant spools of fiber-optic cable navigate the predetermined route.

As the ship moves, the cable is unspooled and carefully laid on the ocean floor. The cable is sometimes buried in seabed sediments in shallow waters for protection against fishing activities, anchors and natural events. In deeper areas, the cables are laid directly on the seabed.

Along the route, repeaters are installed at intervals to amplify the optical signal and ensure data can travel long distances without degradation. This entire process can take months or even years, depending on the length and complexity of the cable route.

Each year, an estimated 100 to 150 undersea cables are cut, primarily accidentally by fishing equipment or anchors. However, the potential for sabotage, particularly by nation-states, is a growing concern. These cables, crucial for global connectivity and owned by consortia of internet and telecom companies, often lie in isolated but publicly known locations, making them easy targets for hostile actions.

The vulnerability was highlighted by unexplained failures in multiple cables off the coast of West Africa on March 14, 2024, which led to significant internet disruptions affecting at least 10 nations. Several cable failures in the Baltic Sea in 2023 raised suspicions of sabotage.

The strategic Red Sea corridor has emerged as a focal point for undersea cable threats. A notable incident involved the attack on the cargo ship Rubymar by Houthi rebels. The subsequent damage to undersea cables from the ship’s anchor not only disrupted a significant portion of internet traffic between Asia and Europe but also highlighted the complex interplay between geopolitical conflicts and the security of global internet infrastructure.

Undersea cables are protected in several ways, starting with strategic route planning to avoid known hazards and areas of geopolitical tension. The cables are constructed with sturdy materials, including steel armor, to withstand harsh ocean conditions and accidental impacts.

Beyond these measures, experts have proposed establishing ""cable protection zones"" to limit high-risk activities near cables. Some have suggested amending international laws around cables to deter foreign sabotage and developing treaties that would make such interference illegal.

The recent Red Sea incident shows that help for these connectivity challenges might lie above rather than below. After cables were compromised in the region, satellite operators used their networks to reroute internet traffic. Undersea cables are likely to continue carrying the vast majority of the world’s internet traffic for the foreseeable future, but a blended approach that uses both undersea cables and satellites could provide a measure of protection against cable cuts.","The article discusses undersea cables extensively, mentioning that 'each year, an estimated 100 to 150 undersea cables are cut,' which indicates a direct focus on the topic of cut sea cables.

It provides specific examples of incidents, such as cable failures off the coast of West Africa and damage from the attack on the cargo ship Rubymar, highlighting the implications of these cuts on global connectivity.

Overseas internet, phone and fax communication almost exclusively run on undersea fibre optic cables. Here's the background on the cables, and how they are becoming a Russia-U.S. issue.

#### New York Times raises alarm about Russian submarines operating near undersea cables

If you're reading this outside continental North America, you almost certainly used a submarine cable to get it. With the exception of Antarctica, which relies on satellites, overseas internet, phone and fax communication almost exclusively run on undersea fibre optic cables. And those cables cross the seas all over the map.

TeleGeography has an interactive map on their website showing 343 submarine cables, in service and planned. And the number keeps growing.

A story on Sunday from the New York Times makes it sound like the next edition of the map should also add ornate illustrations of Russian submarines and spy ships. According to the Times, their military and intelligence sources are saying ""that from the North Sea to Northeast Asia and even in waters closer to American shores, they are monitoring significantly increased Russian activity along the known routes of the cables.""

#### Content companies the new big consumers

In 2014, the bandwidth used by companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft exceeded other internet bandwidth use on the transatlantic cables for the first time. Content providers helped increase global bandwidth demand by 44 percent last year.

#### Frequent cable breaks

TeleGeography researcher Tim Stronge says a cable break happens so often, about twice a week, that it's ""a ho-hum event"" — but an expensive one. About two-thirds of the breaks are caused by anchors or fishing trawlers, the rest mostly by undersea earthquakes and volcanoes.

#### Protecting the cables

Some countries require vessels of a certain size to have a transponder so they will be detected when they are over a fibre optic cable. Telecoms and governments use satellite technology to monitor the areas near cables.

#### What if?

Fifteen cables handle transatlantic traffic, and ships are out in the Atlantic laying the sixteenth. Stronge says such ""very widespread and co-ordinated attacks would be very difficult to pull off and very expensive to do.""

#### Russia's undersea cables

The TeleGeography submarine cable map shows only six cables connect to Russia. Stronge says Russia isn't heavily dependent on international submarine cables, and they meet a lot of their external requirements through land-line connections to Western Europe.","The article discusses 'undersea cables' and 'submarine cables' extensively, highlighting their importance for global communication and the geopolitical tensions surrounding them.

"Do Sharks Bite Undersea Fiber Optic Cables?","Over 20 years of documented shark attacks on cables causing significant damage; discusses implications for telecoms, including downtime and repair costs.","https://www.oafrica.com/broadband/sharks","","",Yes,-,"Cape Town, South Africa","274660","2011-08-23","English","oAfrica","**Do sharks still bite undersea fiber optic cables?**

A recent article in Business Daily Africa examines how telecoms, specifically in Kenya, have taken measures to prevent downtime across their fiber optic networks. Interestingly, however is the potential for shark bites to interrupt fiber optic service to parts of Africa. I’m not sure if the author is basing this information on current fact, or past fear from what happened in the early days of undersea fiber optics. He writes:

> The undersea cables are prone to shark attacks which may lead to losses if there are no other alternative routes to connect them to other parts of the world.

If true, such news is worrisome considering shark attacks on fiber optic lines were first noted over 20 years ago. Time Magazine even wrote a story on the subject. At that time, AT&T was testing a fiber optic line in the Canary Islands at a relatively shallow depth. Shark teeth were discovered embedded in parts of the cable and researchers scrambled to solve the mystery.

Unlike short-haul terrestrial fiber cables or old copper cables where the fiber did not emit noticeable fields, undersea cables must carry high voltage power to the undersea repeaters, which result in both electric and magnetic fields around and along the cable. A significant 50 Hz field is caused by AC current induced into the power feed system for the cable. In addition, a weak low-frequency field is generated by the DC current on the cable. Some sharks mistaken the electric fields for distressed fish and attempt to feed on the cable. Sharks also bite the cables as they are deployed, recovered, or lifted for repair.

What happens when a shark bite tears into a fiber optic cable? Underwater.com explains in detail:

> When the deepwater sharks bit into the light wave cable, the teeth penetrated the medium density polyethylene (MDPE) jacket on the cable. This exposed the copper tube, surrounding the core of the cable, to seawater. The electric current, which flows through the copper tube to power the amplifiers, arced into the sea and short-circuited the power system, causing the cable to lay lifeless at 9,000 feet (2,744 m).

Since the costs of unearthing and repairing a cable are not cheap, measures have been taken to prevent damage by curious sharks. The results of the testing showed that the layers of 0.15 millimeter steel and a high density 0.05 millimeter polyethylene jacket protect that insulation from shark attack. Generally, sharks do not feed below 1,500m, so only cables shallower than this depth need extra reinforcement from sharks. However, boat anchors are still a risk.

African undersea cables will not last for long if they are easily damaged and require costly maintenance. However, it seems unlikely that the cables would be susceptible to shark attacks after hundreds of millions of dollars of planning and investment. Either way, no one can criticize the telecoms for taking the time to ensure network stability.","The article titled ""Do sharks still bite undersea fiber optic cables?"" directly addresses the topic of cut sea cables by discussing how shark bites can damage undersea fiber optic cables.

It provides historical context, noting that shark attacks on cables have been documented for over 20 years, and mentions specific incidents where sharks have bitten into cables, causing significant damage.

The article also discusses the implications of these incidents for telecommunications, emphasizing the potential downtime and costs associated with repairing damaged cables.

Furthermore, it outlines preventive measures that telecom companies are taking to protect their infrastructure from such attacks.

This comprehensive coverage indicates that the article treats the topic of cut sea cables as a central theme rather than a minor mention."

Norman Santos, Oceanic Time Warner Cable vice president of operations, holds a sample of the fiber-optic cable that was severed 30 miles off of Kihei, Maui, resulting in a loss of coverage since yesterday morning.

When it comes to repairing a severed fiber-optic cable 3,000 feet under the sea, it won’t be as simple as calling the cable guy.

""Wish it was,"" said Cliff Miyake, general manager of tw telecom, which co-owns the severed cable that interrupted service for hours to about 400,000 Oceanic Time Warner Cable customers here yesterday. ""It could be a very costly repair.""

At about 1:10 a.m., Oceanic Time Warner started seeing disruptions. It was later discovered that part of a fiber-optic cable was severed about 30 miles off Kihei, Maui.

Most, if not all, Internet service was restored by yesterday afternoon. TV service on Maui and the Big Island was the last to be restored because of the cut’s proximity to both counties.

Oceanic Time Warner rents bandwidth (data transmission capacity) from the fiber-optic cable, co-owned by Colorado-based tw telecom and Wavecom Solutions, formerly Pacific Lightnet. Tw telecom was part of Time Warner Cable but became an independent entity in 2008.

Oceanic Time Warner is among 144 Maui firms that rent bandwidth from that section of the cable. That section went online in 1997, Miyake said.

When the cable was cut, Internet protocol addresses did not know which route to take back to the mainland. Oceanic crews had to reroute connections through alternate cables connecting the islands.

""We have a daisy-chain fiber connection that connects all the islands together,"" said Norman Santos, Oceanic’s vice president of operations. ""The main transmission point for Oceanic Cable is here on Oahu.""

Oahu and Kauai services were restored by 8 a.m. yesterday. Maui and Big Island services were restored by yesterday afternoon.

""We have a disaster recovery plan,"" Miyake said. ""There was another separate system we had access to, so we worked to get that up and running, and that’s what we’ll be using.""

It was not immediately known how the cable was cut. Initial indications seem to point to the possibility that water may have seeped into the cable, but Santos said crews cannot be sure until they see the cable itself.

A cable repair ship must be contracted by owners tw telecom and use pontoons to float the cable up to the service for repair. The process is likely to take up to five weeks, Santos said.

The cable is a Prisma DT digital transport system by Georgia-based Scientific-Atlanta Inc., which is now part of Cisco Systems Inc., according to Star-Advertiser files.

Maui County officials reported that offices with phone numbers that have the 270 prefix were unable to receive or make phone calls due to a disruption of service. Also affected were offices at the county building in Wailuku and administrative offices of the Wailuku Police and Fire departments.

Big Island Civil Defense said there was a ""minor inconvenience"" with Internet service. However, the agency also uses DSL Internet connections.

State Civil Defense, which uses a special dedicated line provided by Oceanic, did record that a break occurred, but it did not affect its Internet, said Shelly Ichishita, state spokeswoman.

Bank of Hawaii experienced phone problems with service on Maui and the Big Island, but full service was restored at 10:30 a.m.

Russell Pang, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office, said the state government does not use Oceanic for any of its phone service.

Hawaiian Telcom services were not affected by the undersea cable cut, but made its interisland fiber-optic cable network available to assist residents and businesses on the Big Island, Maui, Molokai and Lanai during the cable repair process, said Hawaiian Telcom President and Chief Executive Officer Eric Yeaman in a written statement.

Oceanic users having problems connecting with Oceanic Roadrunner Internet service may have to reboot by unplugging the cable modem for 20 seconds and then plugging it back in.

Santos said Oceanic is still evaluating whether to allow claims on loss of business due to yesterday’s outage. Oceanic has a policy to not respond to claims unless the outage was longer than 24 hours, but Santos acknowledged that yesterday’s outage was a unique circumstance.

""This is not normal,"" Santos said. ""We’ll make the determination, and once we know the final remedy, we’ll go from there.""","The article titled 'Severed deep-sea cable disrupts service' provides detailed coverage of an incident where a fiber-optic cable was severed approximately 30 miles off Kihei, Maui.

It discusses the immediate effects of this disruption on about 400,000 customers of Oceanic Time Warner Cable, highlighting the loss of internet and TV services and the complexities involved in repairing such a deep-sea cable.

The article describes the potential causes of the cable cut, including the possibility of water intrusion, and outlines the steps taken to restore service, indicating its focus on the implications of the severed cable.

This aligns well with the criterion of discussing cut sea cables comprehensively rather than just briefly mentioning related topics.

Earlier this year we fielded some of the most frequently asked questions about submarine cables. How do they work? How thick are they? How many kilometers of cable are there?  
Today, we're going back under the sea to talk about what happens when bad things happen to good submarine cables.  
And remember—if you have more queries about submarine cables that we haven't covered in our blog yet, tweet it to us @TeleGeography.  
  
### Do cables break?  
Yes! Cable faults are common. On average, there are over 100 each year.  
You rarely hear about these cable faults because most companies that use cables follow a “safety in numbers” approach to usage, spreading their networks' capacity over multiple cables so that if one breaks, their network will run smoothly over other cables while service is restored on the damaged one.  
Unintentional damage from fishing vessels and ships dragging anchors account for two-thirds of all cable faults.  
Environmental factors like earthquakes also contribute to damage. Less commonly, underwater components can fail. Deliberate sabotage and shark bites are exceedingly rare.  
  
### I’ve heard that sharks are known for biting cables. Is that not true?  
This is probably one of the biggest myths that we see cited in the press. While it’s true that in the past sharks have bitten a few cables, they are not a major threat.  
According to data from the International Submarine Cable Protection Committee, fish bites (a category that includes sharks) accounted for zero cable faults between 2007 and 2014. The majority of damage to submarine cables comes from human activity, primarily fishing and anchoring, not sharks.  
  
### What happens to cables when they are old and turned off?  
Cables are engineered with a minimum design life of 25 years, but there is nothing magical about this time span.  
Cables may remain operational longer than 25 years, but they’re often retired earlier because they’re economically obsolete. They just can’t provide as much capacity as newer cables at a comparable cost, and are thus too expensive to keep in service.  
When a cable is retired it could remain inactive on the ocean floor. Increasingly, there are companies that are gaining the rights to cables, pulling them up, and salvaging them for raw materials.  
In some cases, retired cables are repositioned along other routes. To accomplish this task, ships recover the retired cable and then re-lay it along a new path. New terminal equipment is deployed at the landings stations. This approach can sometimes be a cost-effective method for countries with small capacity requirements and limited budgets.","The article titled ""Cable Breakage: When and How Cables Go Down"" discusses various aspects of submarine cables, including their vulnerabilities and the causes of faults.

It frequently refers to ""submarine cables"" and ""cable faults,"" which are directly related to the topic of cut sea cables.

The article provides a comprehensive overview of the reasons for cable faults, emphasizing that over 100 cable faults occur each year, predominantly due to unintentional damage from fishing vessels and ships dragging anchors.

This directly addresses the implications of cut sea cables.

Furthermore, it implies the impact of cable faults on internet connectivity by noting that companies spread their network capacity over multiple cables to ensure that service continues smoothly even when one cable breaks.

The consistent use of terms like ""submarine cables"" and ""cable faults"" reinforces that the article is focused on the topic, and the discussion of cable breakage is a central theme of the article, not a minor mention.

**Deep Sea Diving**  
February 2020

Last month I attended the New Zealand Network Operators' Group meeting (NZNOG'20). One of the more interesting talks for me was given by Cisco's Beatty Lane-Davis on the current state of subsea cable technology. There is something quite compelling about engineering a piece of state-of-the-art technology that is intended to be dropped off a boat and then operate flawlessly for the next twenty-five years or more in the silent depths of the world's oceans! It brings together advanced physics, marine technology and engineering to create some truly amazing pieces of communications infrastructure.

### A Potted (and Regionally Biased) History of Subsea Cables

On the 5th August 1856, the Atlantic Telegraph Company completed the first trans-Atlantic submarine telegraph cable. It was a simple affair with seven copper conductor wires, wrapped with three coats of gutta-percha. This was further wrapped in tarred hemp and an 18-strand helical sheath of iron wires. It didn't last long due to high voltage issues.

Over the ensuing years, techniques improved, with in-line amplifiers allowing the signal to be propagated across longer distances. The basic design remained the same: a copper conductor sheathed in a watertight insulating cover.

In Australia, the first telegraph system, completed in 1872, used an overland route to Darwin, connecting to Singapore and beyond.

One of the earlier systems for Australia was commissioned in 1962, linking Australia via New Zealand, Fiji, and Hawaii to Canada. This cable used valve-based undersea repeaters and was decommissioned in 1984.

Today there are just under 400 submarine cables in service globally, with 1.2 million km of cable.

### Ownership

The first cable systems were expensive, limiting early users to the press and government agencies. The model of consortium cable ownership developed, where capacity was shared among national carriers.

The internet construction boom in the 1990s coincided with deregulation, allowing other entities to obtain cable landing rights, leading to the entrance of carrier wholesalers and large content enterprises into the submarine cable market.

### Cables

The basic physical cable design used today is similar to early designs. The signal bearer has changed from copper to fibre, with various protective layers depending on the cable's location.

**By TechCentral**  
July 17, 2024

Repairs have finally commenced on three subsea telecommunications cables that were damaged in the Red Sea in February, even as Houthi militants escalate their attacks on ships in the area.

The AAE-1 cable, a 25,000 km fibre-optic link between Asia and Europe, was repaired by a ship owned by E-Marine, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi-based Emirates Telecommunications Group. The cable came online this week, a Yemeni government official said. The same ship, Niwa, remains in Yemeni waters to repair the remaining two cables, Seacom and EIG.

The cables, among more than a dozen that run through the Red Sea, were severed by the anchor of a cargo ship sunk by Iran-backed Houthi militants in late February.

Repairs to the cables have depended on gaining access to infrastructure in Yemen’s waters, a task complicated by the country’s split government and the fact the Red Sea is a conflict zone. It has taken months of negotiations involving the cable operators and the two factions that control Yemen — the internationally recognised government in the south and the Houthi-backed government in Sanaa — to arrange for the repair mission.

“These are some of the biggest data highways connecting Europe, Middle East, India and Asia,” said Roderick Beck, a consultant who sources network capacity on subsea cables for telecoms clients. “The downtime has forced carriers to completely reroute traffic by building new digital highways stitched together using new cables at considerable expense and working around the clock.”

Although the telecoms data that passes along the damaged cables was rerouted, the incident highlighted the vulnerability of critical subsea infrastructure and the challenges of making repairs in the Red Sea, one of the world’s most important shipping lanes and a conflict zone since late 2023.","The article titled ""Finally, Progress With Red Sea Cable Repairs"" discusses the repair of subsea telecommunications cables that were damaged in the Red Sea due to incidents involving Houthi militants.

The Fiber Cuts in the Middle East are getting a lot of attention. The economic damage is real and the geopolitical issues are extremely complex. From an operations perspective, these outages are nothing new, and underscore why having ""many eggs in few baskets"" is such a problem.  

To understand the current issue, I recommend Neal Stephenson’s incredible Wired article from 1996 entitled ""Mother Earth Mother Board"":  
> It sometimes seems as though every force of nature, every flaw in the human character, and every biological organism on the planet is engaged in a competition to see which can sever the most cables.  

The Museum of Submarine Telegraphy in Porthcurno, England, has a display of wrecked cables bracketed to a slab of wood, labeled with causes of failure: trawler maul, spewed core, teredo worms, crab’s nest, and more.  

The capacity of optical fibers climbs, so does the economic damage caused when the cable is severed. FLAG makes money by selling capacity to long-distance carriers. If FLAG gets chopped, no calls get through, resulting in significant revenue loss.  

The rule of thumb for calculating revenue loss is about $3,000 a minute for every penny per minute that the long-distance market will bear on a route. Upcoming advances in fiber bandwidth may push this figure past the million-dollar-a-minute mark.

**Update Feb-06 @ 08:52 GMT:** I am aware of five cable segments experiencing problems, including one that was reported on January 23rd. A lot of confusion could be avoided if FLAG Telecom and other carriers provided timely updates on their website.","The article 'Understanding the undersea cable cuts…' discusses the topic of cut sea cables in detail, covering specific incidents, causes, and the economic and geopolitical implications of such cuts.

It provides concrete examples and calculations of revenue loss due to cable severance, indicating a strong focus on the significance of this issue in telecommunications.

The cable, linking the Latvian town of Ventspils with Sweden’s Gotland Island, was damaged in Sweden’s exclusive economic zone at a depth of over 50 meters.

Latvian Prime Minister Evika Silina described the damage as “significant” and likely caused by external factors.

After an extraordinary government meeting, she confirmed that Latvia was coordinating with NATO and Baltic Sea nations to clarify the circumstances surrounding the incident.

Latvia’s navy dispatched a patrol boat to investigate a vessel suspected of involvement, while two more ships in the area were also under investigation.

One of the vessels, the Malta-flagged bulk carrier Vezhen, was tracked near the damaged cable. MarineTraffic data revealed the Vezhen was closely followed by a Swedish Coast Guard vessel on Sunday evening as both headed toward the southern Swedish coastline.

While Latvian officials have not confirmed whether the Vezhen is under investigation, the Swedish Coast Guard declined to comment on its involvement, saying it was too early to provide details.

NATO has joined the investigation, with its ships and aircraft cooperating with Baltic Sea nations to assess the damage and, if necessary, take appropriate action.

Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson confirmed Sweden’s collaboration with Latvia and NATO, adding that Sweden would deploy its resources to support the investigation.

In response to growing threats to critical infrastructure in the region following a series of incidents involving damaged undersea cables, pipelines, and power lines, NATO has launched a mission called the “Baltic Sentry.”

The mission will increase the surveillance of ships in the Baltic Sea with the deployment of more drones, patrol aircraft and warships to protect crucial undersea cables.

The alliance has reserved the right to take action against any vessels seen as a threat to regional security. The Latvian State Radio and Television Centre (LVRTC), which operates the cable, has begun contracting a vessel to start repairs.

Although the exact cause of the damage remains unclear, the LVRTC said that it can only be determined once repairs start. Communication providers have already switched to alternative transmission routes to minimise the disruption.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the Baltic Sea has seen several incidents of damaged infrastructure.

Last month, Finnish police seized a Russian oil tanker suspected of damaging the Finnish-Estonian Estlink 2 power line and four telecom cables by dragging its anchor across the seabed.

In November 2023, the 745-mile C-Lion1 fibre optic cable connecting Finland to Germany was also damaged, with the authorities of both nations suspecting Russian sabotage.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen reiterated the union’s commitment to support the Baltic nations to address these challenges.

The LVRTC stated that while gas pipelines and power cables can take months to repair, damaged fibre optic cables in the Baltic Sea are typically restored within weeks.

The Swedish Navy and Coast Guard have also refrained from providing any more details. Spokesperson, Jimmie Adamsson said that it was too early to find out if the damage was intentional or caused by a technical fault.","The article discusses a significant incident involving an undersea fibre optic cable that was damaged in the Baltic Sea.

**Published Date:** 02/06/2023  

Cable breaks or faults on subsea optical cables can impact global digital connectivity and have costly ramifications for businesses and internet users. Three such incidents impacted users on the African continent in 2020 alone. Each year more than a hundred cable breaks are recorded across the world causing disruptions to communications and connectivity.

A recent study conducted by Professor Peter J. Talling and a team from the Departments of Earth Sciences and Geography, from the University of Durham in the UK, co-led by Angola Cables and supported by industry members including, the Vodafone Group, British Telecom, NERC Environmental and others, has delivered important findings presenting valuable insights for the routing and protection of future subsea cables.

In January 2020, the South Atlantic 3/West Africa (SAT-3/Wasc) cable, linking Africa to Portugal and Spain was hit by a breakdown in Gabon, whilst the West Africa Cable System (Wacs) that connects South Africa to the United Kingdom saw an outage off the coast of the DRC Congo.

In March, the WACS cable experienced a further break affecting international bandwidth. Whilst many ISPs suffered extended outage periods, most of the major mobile operators were able to mitigate the impact on internet traffic due to their redundancy measures and were in a position to redirect data traffic to other subsea cable networks. Large telcos and mobile operators often employ a divergent strategy to ensure they have alternative routings in place should one of their data carrying cables be affected.

#### Threats to subsea cables

It is estimated that around 1.2 million kilometers of subsea cable carrying power and transmitting data currently transverse continents and geographies across the world. Most of these cables are either buried in the seabed or rest on the ocean floor.

Nearly 75% of the damage caused to these cables are the result of being snagged or damaged by the anchors of ships. Deep see cable faults in water depths of more than 1,000 meters below the sea level, are almost always caused by natural events such as current abrasion, underwater landslides and underwater seismic activity. Often the problem with deep water faults is that they are not as easy to detect and can impact multiple cables – making recovery and repair efforts both lengthy and costly to cable operators.

The cable fault on the SAT-3 was likely caused by an exceptionally large and powerful submarine mud slide that originated at the mouth of the Congo River, just 10 days after the Congo River recorded its largest flood since the 1960s. Sand and mud from the river flood was presumably remobilized, triggering the submarine mud slide that flowed through the offshore Congo Canyon. The canyon is one of the largest underwater canyons on earth, cutting across the continental shelf of West Africa for 85 kilometers until it reaches the shelf edge, then continues down the slope and ends 280 kilometers from its origin. At its deepest point, the V-shaped canyon walls are 1100 meters in height.

These powerful mud slides that damage seabed cables are notoriously difficult to measure in action and are thus poorly understood. The international study undertaken involved the placement of a series of sensors along the canyon, and these sensors that recorded unique information on this type of mud slide. According to observations by Professor Talling and the team, “the data that we recovered from the seabed sensor and mooring data sets within the Congo Canyon have revealed that the undersea mudslide is possibly the longest recorded sediment flow yet measured in action on our planet.”

The evidence gathered provided valuable scientific insights into how major flows are triggered; the frequency, speed and potential impact of mudslides or runout events – the longer the runout the more hazardous these mudslides can be for undersea cables. The other important conclusion was that some cables do not break, but adjacent cables can experience faults by virtue of their location or next to deeply eroded knickpoints.

The January 2020 event caused 9 of the oceanographic moorings to surface. By combining the timings of when moorings reached the sea surface and the cable breaks, Professor Talling and his team were able to calculate the flow speed of the massive undersea avalanche. It has been estimated that following the initial mudslide in the canyon, the moving sediment increased in speed from 5 m/s in Angolan waters in the upper canyon, to reach 8 m/s in the deep ocean, at water depths of 4-5 km – running out some 1,200 km from the river mouth.

“Depending on the proximity of cable repair vessels, outages can often take a number of weeks to repair resulting in costly losses to economies impacted by such breaks,” notes Talling, “Gathering evidence and the recorded data in studies such as these are critical to understanding the nature of such subterranean events, and how the subsea cable industry can better provide more durable solutions in keeping the cables – and the world connected.”

The SAT-3 and WACS cable breaks occurred in January and March, 2020 disrupting international network and data traffic. These incidents occurred at a time when many impacted geographies were entering national lockdowns as a result of the global, Covid-19 pandemic. A joint international recovery and repair effort was initiated to restore the faulty cable systems. Post the repair of the cable cuts, efforts were then focused on recovering the sensors and cable mooring data sets.","The article discusses the SAT-3 and WACS cables, detailing how they were affected by submarine mudslides.

Sweden's coast guard quickly intercepted the vessel as soon as the cable breach was identified. The crew opted to divert out of the legal safety of international waters and into Swedish territorial seas, where it was detained; when asked by SVT whether they changed course voluntarily, a senior Swedish prosecutor declined to answer.

_Vezhen_ is operated by Bulgarian shipping company Navigation Maritime Bulgare (Navibulgar) and flagged in Malta. By examining corporate records in Hong Kong, Finnish outlet Helsingin Sanomat determined that the ultimate beneficial owner is ICBC Leasing, a financier owned by the Chinese state.

Navibulgar CEO Alexander Kalchev told SVT that the anchor came loose in heavy weather, and that it was an accident. “This is something that needs to be proven,” he said.

Are the sharks all to blame, or should other aquatic creatures also be held responsible for Vietnam’s sluggish internet?

Vietnam is no stranger to submarine internet cable breakages: this year alone, the country’s cables at the bottom of the East Sea have broken five times, in January, February, August, October, and November. The most recent issue still hasn’t been resolved, and internet service providers (ISPs) are unsure when local connections will return to normal.

In a recent series on Vietnam’s 20-year journey with the internet, Tuoi Tre looked into the obscure process behind how local ISPs carry out maintenance and repairs on submarine cables. For technicians from the country’s largest ISPs, breakages have lost the surprise element as they’re now “used to all the problems” and have put in place backup procedures in case of an outage.

Much of Vietnam’s data goes through three major undersea fiber optic cables: the Asia-America Gateway (AAG), the Intra-Asia cable (IA), and the Asia-Pacific Gateway (APG). The first two were installed in 2009 while the APG became operational starting in 2016.

By the end of 2016, the country’s international bandwidth speed had reached 3.8 terabytes per second – 38 times faster than before the AAG was installed.

General Director of FPT Telecom Nguyen Van Khoa told Tuoi Tre that there are many reasons behind the numerous breakages of the undersea cable network, including weather, marine traffic, and seismic activity.

According to experts, the stretch of ocean between Vietnam and Singapore is home to busy shipping routes frequently utilized by heavy freighters and fishing boats. Thus, the cables have to endure anchors being dropped and dragged over them daily.

Vietnam’s coastal area is also prone to tropical storms, which can wreak havoc on the cable network.

Of course, at times, these internet outages can also be caused by human factors. In 2007, the Thailand-Vietnam-Hong Kong (TVH) cable malfunctioned, rendering much of Vietnam’s network sluggish for months. The cause: a gang of local pirates stole 98 kilometers of cables and a repeater to resell as ve chai. The repair cost US$1.3 million, a quarter of which came out of VNPT’s pocket.

In other cases, the control station in the impacted locality will identify the cut’s location and inform the system operators, who will order a cable repair vessel to book a repair date. Each of these stages usually takes one day.

Depending on which country the cable break is nearest, the repair ship and cable operator will then send a document to its government seeking access to carry out repairs. Getting permission often takes a week, while traveling to the location can take the vessel from three to four days.

The actual repair work is a collaborative effort between divers and submersible robots. This entire process ranges from three weeks to a month, depending on the severity of the rupture and weather conditions.

It has become something of a running gag in Vietnam that curious sharks are behind these internet “attacks,” however, there has never been any concrete evidence proving this conjecture. Nonetheless, tech giant Google seems to buy into the theory: in 2014, a product manager from the firm revealed that his company was taking measures to protect cables from sharks.

Frequent breakages are not a problem unique to Asia-Pacific; cables in the Atlantic Ocean also require some 50 repairs annually due to an array of reasons, including fishing trawlers to anchors and earthquakes.","The article titled ""Sharks, Anchors & Red Tape: Why It Takes Forever to Fix Vietnam's Broken Internet Cables"" discusses the issue of undersea internet cable breakages in Vietnam extensively.

It mentions that Vietnam's submarine internet cables have broken multiple times within a year, specifically five times in 2017 alone, and provides specific details about the causes of these breakages, which include weather, marine traffic, and even human actions such as theft.

The article explains the impact of these cable cuts on internet connectivity and the lengthy repair process, which can take weeks due to regulatory permissions and logistical challenges.

It also humorously addresses the myth that sharks are responsible for the cable damage, while noting that there is no concrete evidence to support this claim.

Overall, the article is centered around the topic of cut sea cables, detailing incidents, their causes, and their consequences for internet connectivity in Vietnam."

In connection with the New York Times article about the Russians not even contemplating cutting honest Western undersea cables - that article seems like another attempt of the US Navy and industry to boost the sales prospects of the US Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs).

Undersea cables were first laid in the 1850s between Britain and Europe and between Britain and US-Canada. Cables have been broken by human (fishing trawlers, poor leaky cable insulation material and anchors) and natural (earthquakes, currents, bitey sharks and whales) activity. A number of ports, such as Halifax, Canada, near important cable routes became homes to specialised cable repair ships.

Jonathan Reed Winkler writing in War on the Rocks records that during the Spanish - American War (1898) US naval ships cut undersea cables to isolate the major Spanish possessions of the Philippines, Puerto Rico and Cuba. Spanish ground and naval forces were thus prevented from having rapid communications with the high command in Spain.

Surface ships have been more commonly used to cut undersea cables. In World War One, the British General Post Office Cable Ship CS Alert was used to locate and cut five German cables heading into the Atlantic. A similar operation cut the German cables that connected Great Britain to the German coast. Successive missions by the CS Telconia and other ships later in the war eliminated the remainder of Germany's cable network and, in some instances, pulled the cables up with their grapples and relaid them into British and French ports for use by the Allied powers instead. Theft? See this source.

This useful book link indicates submarines, very early on, were also active in cable cutting. ""The U-151 [in 1918] also cut the undersea cables between New York and Nova Scotia and New York and Colon, Panama.""

At the beginning of World War Two Atlantic cables would have been cut in 1939, mainly by surface ships. In the Pacific the Japanese advance was so fast that allied cable cutting sometimes took until 1945. One of the cutters was Max Shean from Western Australia doing very hazardous duty.

Since 1945 cables continue to be broken by fishing trawlers, anchors, earthquakes, currents, and bitey sharks. In response to this threat to the communications network, the practice of cable burial has developed. Still, cable breaks are by no means a thing of the past, with more than 50 repairs a year in the Atlantic alone, and significant breaks in 2006, 2008, and 2009.

The risk of fishing trawler nets causing cable faults was exploited during the Cold War. For example, in February 1959, a series of 12 breaks occurred in five American trans-Atlantic communications cables. In response, a United States naval vessel, the U.S.S. Roy O. Hale, detained and investigated the Russian trawler Novorosiysk. A review of Novorosiysk's log indicated it had been in the region of each of the cables when they broke. Broken sections of cable were also found on the deck of the Novorosiysk. It appeared that the cables had been dragged along by the ship's nets, and then cut once they were pulled up onto the deck to release the nets. The Russian stance on the investigation was that detaining Novorosiysk was unjustified, but the United States cited the Convention for the Protection of Submarine Telegraph Cables of 1884 to which Russia had signed as evidence of violation of international law.

Thus the Russians do have a record of cutting cables but they do not need dark ominous $Billion dollar submarines or UUVs to do it – just small cable ships or even trawlers.

Cable Landing Stations can locate a break in a cable in less than a second. This is using electronic monitors and measurements, such as through spread-spectrum time-domain reflectometry (SSTDR).

In a major war cable cutting has three main advantages:

1. It immediately disrupts an enemy's international communications.
2. It also immediately disrupts domestic communications because, in the digital age, much of the internet AND telecommunications between major cities of the same country rely on international servers and links.
3. Having lost international cables an enemy is forced to use satellites, microwave links and other radio links. Since the beginning of World War One cables have been cut, in part, because subsequent reliance on radio links is much more easy to intercept.","The article titled 'Undersea Cable Cutting History' provides a comprehensive overview of the topic of cut sea cables.

According to Microsoft, four undersea cables off the coast of Abidjan and the Cote d’Ivoire were severed and the breaks caused by “seismic activity”. These are the main internet cables which connect South Africa to Europe running along the west coast of Africa, including the West Africa Cable System (Wacs) and Google’s Equiano cable.

Microsoft named the four cables affected as Wacs, MainOne, Sat-3 and Ace. Local reports say the breaks could take weeks or even months to fix.

Vodacom, a major telco in the region, admitted that all of South Africa’s network providers were affected.

Not helping is that East Africa’s major ‘Seacom’ cable in the Red Sea was also severed, probably by a ship’s anchor. Seacom said in February that data traffic was interrupted on its cable which runs from Mombasa in Kenya to Zafarana in Egypt.

Data indicates that eight West African countries are badly affected, with Cote d’Ivoire, Liberia and Benin being badly hurt. Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon are also suffering disruption while Senegal and even Portugal being impacted.

Microsoft says the cable breaks have reduced total capacity supporting its Azure data centre regions in South Africa, namely South Africa North and South Africa West. Many organisations reported problems accessing Microsoft services, including Teams, last week and through the weekend.

Angola Cable said on March 15th that it has back-up and alternates available to the sector.

Microsoft said it hoped to have mitigated the worst of the breaks by now and that most links were returning to their normal levels. However, Microsoft itself and important institutions such as Nedbank in South Africa reported having to redirect broadband and internet traffic.","The article discusses multiple undersea cable breaks affecting internet connectivity in South Africa and other regions.

By Captain Don Walsh, U.S. Navy (Retired)  

In 2023, there are 552 major seafloor cables in the world with a total length of 850,000 miles. Reliable and cost-effective, they carry more than 95 percent of international data transmissions. Daily, they move financial transactions valued at $10 trillion. Mostly owned by private companies, they are critical elements in the worldwide communications infrastructure. By contrast, satellites carry only 3 percent of global traffic.

There are other cable networks that transmit electrical energy over more moderate distances. An example is the four lines between the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, and Ireland power grids. Bidirectional, they help keep power demands in balance to accommodate both sides of the English Channel. The longest in the world, completed in 2022, is the 450-mile North Sea Link—a 1,400 MW cable between the UK and Norway.

In recent years, offshore wind farms have become a major installer of seafloor electrical cables delivering energy from wind turbines to onshore.

How vulnerable are seafloor cables to disruption? Ruggedly designed and constructed for unattended operations in a hostile environment, they still are subject to damage. Natural tectonic events such as volcanic eruptions, movements of the seafloor, and underwater landslides have severed cables. Humans have damaged cables through ship anchor entanglements, seafloor trawling by fishing vessels, and dredging operations. Almost all outages today are accidents, so owners tend to publicize the mapped locations of their seafloor cables so maritime operations can stay clear of those areas.

Underwater military capabilities have demonstrated the ability to cut cables covertly on the seafloor. On land, maximum damage is most likely at places where more than one cable converge ashore. Some onshore locations are in relatively remote and unpopulated areas. Their destruction would be hard to prevent.

In short, seafloor cable systems are hard to defend and easy to put out of service. So, what can be done to protect them? Some thoughts are to aggressively monitor convergence cable termination sites on shore, increase existing redundancy by adding more cables but dispersing their onshore landing sites, and, in an emergency, develop means to quickly parallel vital communications to satellites and conventional radio transmissions. None of these solutions is ideal, but in sum they could guarantee a level of international communication activity can be maintained.

#### **Seafloor Pipelines**

Today, there are 20,000 miles of pipelines worldwide. Most of them carry petroleum products such as natural gas and crude oil.

In the Gulf of Mexico alone there are at least 8,000 miles of active seafloor pipelines. For more than 80 years pipelines have transported crude oil and natural gas to shore. Surprisingly, the locations of some pipelines are only approximately known. Many are no longer in use, and 97 percent of those have been left in place. Abandoned lines are estimated to add up to 18,000 miles.

How vulnerable are seafloor pipelines to disruption? Like seafloor cables, seafloor pipelines form a fragile network that can be easily damaged. They also are subject to similar natural and man-made damages. But unlike cables, breaching one or more pipelines would not have a major impact in a national emergency. Environmental impacts could be great, but the international energy network could work around the temporary loss of offshore oil and gas.

A test of the loss occurred in September 2022. The Russian-owned Nord Stream 1 and 2 natural gas pipelines in the Baltic were sabotaged by an explosion of uncertain origin and ruptured in several places. The Nord Stream project was politically unpopular, as it was seen by many as a Russian move to make Europe more dependent on its supply of natural gas. After the Ukraine war began, Russia occasionally reduced flow and briefly shut the line in response to economic sanctions. Some believe Russia may have sabotaged its own lines to shut down a significant (40 percent) source of Europe’s natural gas supplies. Repair options are being studied, and it is estimated the work could take up to a decade.","The article titled 'Seafloor Cables and Pipelines: Are They Secure?' discusses the vulnerabilities of seafloor cables, including the potential for them to be cut by underwater military capabilities.

By Olivia Solon and Mohammed Hatem (Bloomberg) —  
Repairs have finally commenced on three subsea telecommunications cables that were damaged in the Red Sea in February, even as Houthi militants escalate their attacks on ships in the area.

The AAE-1 cable, a 25,000-kilometer (15,500 miles) fiber optic link between Asia and Europe, was repaired by a ship owned by E-Marine, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi-based Emirates Telecommunications Group. The cable came online this week, a Yemeni government official said. The same ship, Niwa, remains in Yemeni waters to repair the remaining two cables, Seacom and EIG.

The cables, among more than a dozen that run through the Red Sea, were severed by the anchor of a cargo ship sunk by Iran-backed Houthi militants in late February.

Repairs to the cables have depended on gaining access to infrastructure in Yemen’s waters, a task complicated by the country’s split government and the fact the Red Sea is a conflict zone. It has taken months of negotiations involving the cable operators and the two factions that control Yemen — the internationally-recognized government in the south and the Houthi-backed government in Sanaa — to arrange for the repair mission.

“These are some of the biggest data highways connecting Europe, Middle East, India and Asia,” said Roderick Beck, a consultant who sources network capacity on subsea cables for telecommunications clients. “The downtime has forced carriers to completely reroute traffic by building new digital highways stitched together using new cables at considerable expense and working around the clock.”

Although the telecommunications data that passes along the damaged cables was re-routed, the incident highlighted the vulnerability of critical subsea infrastructure and the challenges of making repairs in the Red Sea, one of the world’s most important shipping lanes and a conflict zone since late 2023. Houthi militants, an Islamist group claiming to support Hamas, have recently ramped up attacks on vessels in the area, including using a drone boat packed with explosives to sink a coal ship, Bloomberg News reported in June.

The consortium operating the AAE-1 cable, which includes Emirates Telecommunications Group, Telecom Egypt and Saudi Arabia’s Mobily, had initially struggled to get a permit from the internationally-recognized Yemeni government because of a dispute over one of the consortium’s members, TeleYemen. The government approved permits for the other two cables in May, but refused AAE-1 and launched a criminal investigation into TeleYemen’s alleged ties to the Houthi militia.

It’s not clear how the AAE-1 cable consortium was able to obtain a permit. A government representative declined to comment further. Representatives for the consortium did not respond to requests for comment. Representatives for Seacom and EIG did not respond to requests for comment.

The Houthis have been attacking merchant and military ships in the southern Red Sea since mid-November. The strikes have forced many cargo vessels to sail around southern Africa instead of through the Red Sea and Suez Canal — sending freight rates soaring and raising concerns about the security of underwater cables that help transmit data across the world.

While espionage and sabotage are growing threats, less dramatic but more frequent factors are causing the biggest problems.

As The Guardian reported, the network of undersea cables is more at risk from anchors and fishing than from Russian spies.

The Guardian reported on the vulnerability of the network of undersea cables that power internet connectivity worldwide, citing Tonga as an example.

In 2022, an underwater eruption 1,000 times the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb severed the country's internet connection, triggering a widespread blackout. The newspaper reported that the incident severely disrupted recovery efforts, disrupted businesses, and strained local economies, underscoring the fragility of internet infrastructure.

Nearly all internet traffic is delivered through high-speed fiber optic cables lying on the ocean floor. Without these cables, many aspects of modern society would grind to a halt. Not least the economy — about $10 trillion in transactions are transmitted through these undersea cables daily, per the US Naval Institute.

TeleGeography, a telecoms research company, notes that there are over 100 cable breaks yearly. According to UltramapGlobal, a company that monitors subsea cables, natural hazards like the one in Tonga account for about 14% of cable faults.

However, around 70% of all cable faults—the vast majority—are caused by man-made damage, primarily by dragging anchors and deep-sea fishing, it estimated. UltramapGlobal said more than a third of the damage comes from fishing, with trawling and fixed nets often damaging the cables.

Business Insider previously reported on a lawsuit between a UK telecoms giant and an Irish fishing trawler over the 2015 damage of a subsea cable. In addition to trawlers, UltramapGlobal said about 25% of damage is caused by ships dragging their anchors.

Sabotage by hostile actors is exceedingly rare, according to TeleGeography. That's not to say, however, that it isn't a cause for concern. Intentional damage can have far-reaching consequences. And sneakier adversaries could also siphon data from the cables without breaking them. According to the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence's 2022 annual threat assessment paper, Russia is particularly focused on improving its ability to target critical infrastructure, including underwater cables. The Wall Street Journal reported in May that US officials privately warned tech companies about the threat of Chinese ships spying using undersea cables in the Pacific region. In response to these threats, NATO established a center dedicated to protecting undersea cables and pipelines.

Nevertheless, for now, the biggest threat to these vital cables remains unsuspecting trawlers.","The article titled ""Undersea internet cables more at risk from accidents than sabotage"" discusses the vulnerabilities of undersea cables, noting that human activities, particularly fishing and anchoring, are the primary causes of cable faults.

It cites specific incidents, such as the Tonga underwater eruption, which severed internet connections, demonstrating the implications of such occurrences on internet connectivity and local economies.

US President Joe Biden warned this week that Russia is considering attacks on critical infrastructure. One of the scenarios that has been mooted since the start of the war in Ukraine is that Moscow will attack undersea cables to cut off the Western world's internet.

""Based on evolving intelligence, [Russia](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/russia/) might be planning a cyber attack against us,” [Biden](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/joe-biden/) said at a press conference on March 21. ""The magnitude of Russia's cyber capacity is fairly consequential and it's coming.""

It was not the first time since the start of Russia's invasion of [Ukraine](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/ukraine/) that the US president has issued this warning. The day after the launch of the Russian invasion on February 24, Washington announced it was ""prepared"" to ward off any Russian cyber attacks.

Biden urged American companies to ""lock their digital doors"" as quickly as possible to protect themselves. The fear is that ""unprecedented cost inflicted on Russia"" by all the latest international sanctions could push [Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/vladimir-putin/) to retaliate by directly attacking [NATO](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/nato/) countries using cyber weapons, Biden said.

Moscow was quick to categorically reject these accusations. ""The Russian Federation, unlike many Western countries including the United States, does not engage in state-level banditry,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday.

**Underwater cables at risk**

But Biden's warnings have nonetheless revived the spectre of a digital disaster scenario in which Russia could deprive much of the world of internet access by attacking undersea cables.

This prospect has been raised more than once, even in high military circles, since the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis. Admiral Tony Radakin, head of the British armed forces, said in January that Moscow could ""put at risk and potentially exploit the world’s real information system, which is undersea cables that go all around the world.”

In excess of 430 undersea internet cables represent tempting targets for anyone wishing to disrupt global connectivity. Often seen as one of the weakest links in the global network, these cables ""look like large garden hoses lying at the bottom of the sea"".

Moreover, they have no special protection, except for ""integrated surveillance systems that can send out alerts only if there is a threat nearby"".

**Easily concealed attacks**

""It is theoretically very easy to conceal the sabotage of an undersea cable,"" said Christian Bueger, a specialist in maritime security issues at the University of Copenhagen.

All it would take to damage a cable would be for a merchant ship or fishing boat to drop its anchor on one not far from the coast, where these infrastructures are at a reasonably shallow level. Divers or submarines could also place explosives on the cables or install mines nearby, which could then be detonated remotely.

The results could be potentially spectacular and very costly for Western economies. As soon as a European internet user logs into their Gmail inbox, writes a tweet or ""likes"" a school friend's Facebook post, their requests cross the Atlantic via a network of these undersea cables.

**An act of war**

Bueger explained there is also ""the impression that during each conflict, the means of communication are always among the priority targets. During the Second World War, it was the telegraphs, and today it would be the undersea cables”.

But depriving the world of internet is not as straightforward as cutting electric wires on the front line in 1939.

""Attacking one internet cable is a bit like destroying a single lane on a ten-lane highway. If the highway has enough capacity, traffic won't notice,"" said Aben. Highly connected countries, such as most European states, the United States or Asian countries, rely on much more than one cable to link them to the world, precisely because these infrastructures are so vulnerable.

""A part from a few isolated islands, there are very few countries that would be deprived of the internet if only two or three cables were damaged,"" said Liebetrau. The islands that would be affected include the Azores archipelago, the island of Madeira and the Australian state of Tasmania.

""Russia would have to mount a large-scale military operation to really threaten internet access for targets like the United States or Europe,"" said Liebetrau. “They would need to do a lot of reconnaissance operations to find out exactly where each cable is located, because although maps exist, they are deliberately not very precise.""

This is why, even if in theory undersea cables appear to be prime targets, ""it's highly unlikely that Russia would go down this route"", assured Liebetrau. An attack of this level would be considered an act of war by the West, Radakin confirmed. And Moscow would probably not be willing to escalate such an operation, which would require a lot of resources without having any significant impact on NATO's military capabilities.

It is possible, however, that Russia could launch some lesser attack, just to prove its power. ""I can see them going after one or two cables as a symbolic gesture,” said Bueger.

An unseen threat is lurking beneath the surface. The suspected Houthi attacks on undersea cables in the Red Sea are a timely reminder of a new reality. The age of seabed warfare, where undersea infrastructure will increasingly be targeted, has arrived.

Predicting the future is always tricky, yet the direction here is clear. Recent situations in the Baltic, North Sea, Black Sea, and now the Red Sea point to a change in the way wars, and hybrid warfare, will be fought. Attacks on undersea infrastructure will likely become more common, even expected.

A victim of future wars might be your internet connection when a cable is cut. Or your heating bill as a gas pipeline or electricity cable is blown up. And these events might take place thousands of miles away, and hundreds of meters below sea level. These new threats are not well understood.

Historic incidents of seabed warfare include Britain cutting German undersea telegraph cables at the outbreak of World War One and the U.S. Navy’s Operation Ivy Bells to tap Soviet undersea cables in the Cold War. However, much has changed since then.

The world is ever more connected, relying on undersea infrastructure for power, natural gas, oil, and the internet. An attack on an offshore wind farm in Sweden could affect electricity bills in Ireland, highlighting the vulnerability of these systems.

### The Seabed Is Ripe For Hybrid Warfare

The inherent ambiguity makes undersea infrastructure tempting targets for hybrid warfare. The absence of a clear culprit allows misinformation to flourish. Attacks can be relatively unsophisticated, executed by divers or ships dragging anchors. 

Small countries and non-state actors can leverage this as well, as seen in the Red Sea and West Africa, where groups like Hamas have developed underwater vehicles to target offshore infrastructure.

### Seabed Warfare As part of Future Hot Wars

Attacks on seabed infrastructure may become common in hot wars. For example, a Chinese attack on Taiwan could threaten undersea internet cables, complicating defense and coordination.

Russia is heavily invested in offensive seabed warfare capabilities, with nuclear submarines designed to interfere with seabed infrastructure. However, the rise of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) could change the landscape of these threats, allowing for covert attacks from great distances.

Attacking seabed targets presents challenges but is increasingly feasible with advancements in technology. High-quality intelligence and planning will be essential for success in this new dimension of warfare.

Johannesburg, 28 Mar 2020  

The West Africa Cable System (WACS) submarine cable has suffered another break.  
This was revealed by the South African National Research & Education Network (SA NREN), a major user of the cable, which detected the break just before midnight.  

In a series of tweets, the organisation said: “We are observing our WACS capacity as down since 23h28 UTC/27th March 2020. A call has been logged with our provider for feedback. Traffic has failed over to SEACOM and EASSy cable systems…”  

It added: “With the WACS and continued SAT-3 outages on the East Coast, SA NREN users working from home during the #Covid19SA #LockdownSA may experience issues if their home providers do not have sufficient capacity via alternate sub-sea cable systems.”  

SA NREN says the WACS outage is due to a suspected cable fault between Highbridge London and Seixal Portugal, and tests are currently being conducted.  

WACS is a submarine communications cable linking SA with the UK along the west coast of Africa that was constructed by Alcatel-Lucent.  
The cable consists of four fibre pairs and is 14 530km in length, linking from Yzerfontein in the Western Cape of SA to London in the UK.  

In January, WACS also suffered a cable break together with the SAT3/WASC cable, resulting in slow Internet speeds in SA.  

Local Internet service providers (ISPs) have already started feeling the impact of the WACS cable break.  
In a tweet this morning ISP Afrohost said: “Two of the undersea cables (WACS and SAT3) have suffered breaks. We’re working together with our suppliers to secure an alternate international path ASAP. We understand that you need your Internet now more than ever. This is our top priority. Thanks for your patience.”  

Webafrica says: “We are currently experiencing slow speeds due to WACS undersea cable breaks. We are busy attending to the issue and will keep you updated on our Network Status page.”  

Says Telkom: “Good day, please note that due to pre-existing outage on the West Africa Submarine Cable System (WACS), you may experience slow Internet response when browsing international websites. Our team of technicians are investigating this and will provide feedback soon.”

The blockade of the entire Cuban coastline by the United States naval forces during the Spanish-American War had become virtually effective by the first of May, 1898, isolating the island from Spain regarding the landing of food, munitions, and mail. However, one means of communication still available was the group of ocean cables connecting Cuba with the West Indies and Spain.

The task of severing this last link with Spain was entrusted to the Navy, which planned to cut the cables at Cienfuegos, as no cables were landed on Cuba's north coast except those controlled by the United States. The fourth division of the United States fleet, including the cruiser Marblehead and the gunboat Nashville, was operating on the south coast of Cuba at this time.

On May 11, the Marblehead and Nashville began bombardment of the Spanish works while boats were sent to cut the cables. The cable landing at Colorado Point had a central conductor of copper wires insulated by a coating, housed in a lead tube, surrounded by heavy iron wires and jute braiding.

The worry stems from the potential for Russia to attack these cables in the event of heightened tensions or conflict, instantly cutting off communication that is vital for the politics, economy, and citizens of Western countries.

While there is currently no evidence of damage to the communication cables, concerns among high-ranking American military and intelligence officials are growing.

The publication notes that internal debates in Washington show that authorities view Russia through a lens of distrust, reminiscent of the 'Cold War' era.

The Pentagon has not disclosed what actions would be taken if the cables were damaged by Russia, but they assured that significant attention is being paid to this issue.","The article titled 'Спецслужбы США: Подлодки РФ хотят повредить интернет-кабели' discusses U.S. intelligence concerns regarding Russian submarines and their potential to damage undersea communication cables.

It’s Fun Fact Friday and today we’re going to talk about repairing submarine cables. Submarine data cables are located under the ocean, and connect people around the world with data and information, while submarine electrical cables transfer electricity, such as those used on wind farms. Undersea cables for data transmission have been around since the mid-1800s.

**Differences in the two types of cables**  
Data cables are made up of a small number of fiber optic strands of glass about the width of a human hair. Most of the cable is actually protection for these strands, as well as conductive material to power the cables. The size of the final product varies depending on the amount of protection it needs: larger, more protected cables are usually near the shore in shallow water, and thinner cables are buried deep under the ocean.

**Why do underwater cables need repair?**  
Damage can be caused by failure in a cable, but this is very uncommon. Earthquakes can damage cables, like the one in 2006 off the coast of Taiwan that caused a loss in international phone and internet data service. The most common failure is boats; trawling by fishing boats and ships dropping anchor can snag and easily damage the cables.

**How are underwater cables repaired?**  
The first step in repairing an underwater cable is figuring out where the damage is located. Data cables are fiber optic, so a light pulse is sent through the cable. Engineers can measure the time it takes the pulse to return to find the specific location of the break. Once the break is located, a cable ship is dispatched to repair. Cable ships are loaded with enough cable for repairs, which can be loaded in a few hours. If the damaged cable is in shallow water, an ROV equipped with cameras is deployed to find the fault and retrieve the cable.

**How do we protect undersea cables?**  
Cables can be protected from shark bites with metal sheathing or a metal tube. For fishing vessels, maps are freely provided to fishermen in the hopes that they do not fish over such cables. Cables transmit about 95% of voice and data traffic for civilians and governments. A greater emphasis on government protection of the cables may be in the future.

We hope you enjoyed this Fun Fact Friday about cable repair.","The article 'How is subsea cable repaired?' discusses submarine cables, which are synonymous with cut sea cables.

It addresses the reasons for cable damage, including natural disasters and human activities, and highlights the implications of such damages on internet connectivity, specifically mentioning significant outages caused by cable faults.

Earlier this week, operators of two communications cables—C-Lion 1 and BCS East-West Interlink—reported faults in the Baltic Sea.

Local internet service seems largely unaffected, but a swirl of sabotage allegations have emerged in the global press.

Without making a ruling on any ongoing investigations, let’s look at the facts.

### How unusual are cable breaks?

Submarine cables break all the time. On average, two to four break somewhere in the world every week.

While damage is more common in some areas than others, these breaks—or “faults”—eventually happen to almost every cable.

### If cables go out of service so often, why don’t I hear about it?

Most of the time, cable faults only make the news if multiple systems go offline or damage occurs in geopolitical hotspots. Simultaneous breaks are more likely to affect service quality, and some islands may lose their undersea connectivity altogether.

You rarely hear about other cable faults because most telecom providers follow a “safety in numbers” approach.

By spreading their networks' capacity over multiple cables, operators ensure that if one breaks, their network will run smoothly over the others until the damage is repaired. This is called network redundancy.

To minimize downtime, cable owners also hold standing agreements with maintenance providers that keep ships on standby, waiting to deploy spares of extra cable length and make needed repairs quickly.

### What causes cables to break?

Most faults are caused by “external aggression.”

That sounds scary! But this term only means that a cable didn't suffer a technical fault on its own, and was instead damaged by external forces. Most come from fishing equipment, normal anchoring activity, and natural disasters like undersea earthquakes. Internal component or equipment failure causes another, smaller category of faults.

Although multiple cables breaking at the same time feels improbable, it’s more likely than you may think.

In some locations, geological or regulatory constraints herd cables into narrow corridors, greatly increasing the risk of simultaneous cuts across multiple cables. Across larger distances, multiple breaks can happen through simple bad luck.

### Are cables ever damaged on purpose?

State-sponsored sabotage is extremely rare, and most publicly known examples are decades old.

However, routine cable faults can resemble sabotage if operators or governments aren’t certain of what caused them.

While less exciting, some fishermen may cut a cable on purpose. This can happen if their gear snags on a cable and they are able to bring it to the surface. To discourage this, cable operators often offer to pay for lost equipment if fishermen sacrifice their gear instead of tampering with the cable.

### How do we know what happened to a cable?

In cases like Tonga’s, where a volcanic explosion famously disrupted the island nation's only subsea connectivity, it’s easy to conclude that environmental damage caused a break.

In other instances, determining the cause of a break takes time. Maintenance crews often set sail knowing where damage occurred—but not what caused it. Once on-site, initial hypotheses can be confirmed or denied based on how the cable looks.

One tool cable operators can use to determine the possible cause of damage from afar is Automatic Identification System (AIS) data.

Ships use AIS to transmit their location back to shore or to other nearby vessels. This helps ensure safe navigation and is required for some ships under international law.

### So if AIS shows a foreign ship crossing a cable, that’s evidence of sabotage?

When AIS shows a vessel passing back and forth over a cable right before it breaks, it can look suspicious.

Sometimes, this is just mundane fishing activity—e.g., a trawler making multiple passes over the seabed to scoop up fish. It may even be legal, as not all countries have protected zones around cables.

AIS data can also indicate where a vessel is flagged.

### What’s next?

Official determination of a fault’s cause is best left to operators, maintenance crews, and government investigators.

There are steps governments and cable developers can take to help reduce faults, including liaising with fishermen, burying cables near shorelines, and promoting cable diversity. To learn more, check out the ICPC’s list of best practices.

Meanwhile, we can find comfort in remembering that extraordinary circumstances and coincidences happen every day, and that most cable faults are just bad luck.

Two ships have started repairing undersea cables that were cut on 19 December disrupting telephone and net services to Asia and the Middle East.

The cables were cut about 140km off the coast of Sicily and are thought to have been damaged by a ship.

Egypt says it has been able to restore most of its communications by re-routing services, but other parts of the Middle East remain badly affected.

The same day, a suspected earthquake damaged the main cable to Malta.

On Sunday, the French repair ship Raymond Croze started work on two of the cables (SEA-ME-WE3 and 4) with the Italian vessel Teliri arriving the next day to work on the Flag Asia-Europe cable.

They three cables were cut within 40 minutes of each other, possibly by a trawler net or ship's anchor.

A ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) will locate the ends of the cables on the sea bed and bring them to the surface to be re-connected.

Flag Europe Asia said it expected to have the FLAG subsea cable repaired by 26 December, although that was dependent on weather and how badly damaged the cable was.

Jonathan Wright - director of wholesale products at Interoute which manages part of the optical fibre network - told the BBC that once one of the cables gets repaired, telecommunication companies will have far more options to get their services back online.

""SEA-ME-WE4 is the newest line. It has the largest capacity and so is probably the most critical line. Once that is repaired it should take some of the pressure off the one remaining cable.""

""As luck would have it, a second submarine line was being installed to Malta earlier this month and that should go on line today, which will help alleviate some of the communication problems Malta is suffering,"" he added.

**Lengthy process**

Engineers from France Telecom Marine arrived at the site of the damage to the SEA-ME-WE4 and SEA-ME-WE3 lines onboard Raymond Croze at 1330 GMT on 21 December, spokesman Louis-Michel Aymard said.

The engineers then sent a remotely-operated submarine robot called ""Hector"" to the sea bed to begin the search for the two ends of each line.

It is unclear how long repairs to the two cables will take, as a ship could have dragged the cables several kilometres from their normal positions.

Once located, the cable ends will be brought to the surface by the robot and repairs will be carried out in a special facility on the ship - a process that could take days.

France Telecom said it expected to repair SEA-ME-WE4 by 25 December and SEA-ME-WE3 by the end of the year.

In January the same line was damaged off Egypt's Mediterranean coast, severely disrupting internet and phone communications for many in the Middle East for days, although only two lines were snapped then.

A few hours before the three lines were cut, a suspected sub-sea earthquake damaged a local GO cable to Malta, severely disrupting communications to the island.","The article provides a comprehensive overview of the incident involving cut undersea cables, detailing the location, causes, and implications for communication services in affected regions.

“The cloud is not in the sky, it is under the sea.” That was a comment from an author of a government study to assess new potential disruptions of undersea communications cables.

Roughly 95 percent of intercontinental global data traffic travels over undersea cables that run across the ocean floor. Globally, the international bandwidth used by network operators has nearly doubled from 2020 to 2022 and has now reached 3.9 Pbps, according to TeleGeography.com.

With such volumes of traffic being carried over the network of undersea cables, increased attention is being focused on the fragility of the system. A single cable cut can bring down services of the major cloud providers, as was the case in an incident last year.

While most disruptions and cable cuts are caused by fishing or anchoring accidents, or natural disasters such as the impact of the Tonga volcano, there is growing concern about sabotage due to political unrest in Europe and the Far East. And new worries are emerging due to the impact of climate change.

On the political front, last year’s sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline highlighted the vulnerability of undersea systems to nefarious actors.

More recently, the potential impact of climate change has been raised. Research published in February in the journal Earth-Science Reviews found that “ocean and nearshore disturbances caused by extreme weather events have exposed hot spots along the transglobal cable network, increasing the risk of internet outages.”

The researchers noted that intensifying tropical cyclones in the northern Pacific Ocean are stressing submarine cables off the coast of Taiwan. Any outage due to such a cause would not only disrupt communications and Internet traffic, but given the charged political environment, some might rush to judgment and falsely attribute the outage to China.

Cables that traverse polar regions, which are strategically important to many nations, are also impacted by climate change. Melting glacial and sea ice “are profoundly changing ocean conditions more rapidly than many other places on Earth.”

“Our analysis clearly stresses the need to carefully plan cable routes and landing station locations factoring in a range of local hazards and how those are affected by climate change,” said co-author Thomas Wahl.

Other researchers have been raising the climate change impact issues for years. For example, Nicole Starosielski noted that while today’s submarine cables are built and placed with greater attention to disaster risk, many cable stations were built before climate change was a consideration.

Why is that an issue? Rising seas could accelerate erosion and increase the flood risk of onshore coastal cable facilities. In hurricane and typhoon zones, severe storms will influence the stability of the continental shelf seabed.

### Safeguard efforts on the rise

Several things are being done to minimize undersea cable outages and service disruptions. Fishing and anchoring annually account for approximately 70 percent of global damage to submarine cables. The International Cable Protection Committee has developed best practices to avoid these problems.

Suggested ways to mitigate damage from fishing and anchoring include route selection, cable armoring, cable burial, and programs to educate fishing fleets regarding the location of submarine cables.

There are also several publicly announced government efforts to address the increased threat due to today's turbulent political times. A report by the European Parliament noted that a key aspect of cable protection is appropriate surveillance and identification of suspicious activities.

To date, cable surveillance is mainly provided by the industry. Some countries are doing more. Triggered by the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline, Britain has committed to two specialist ships with the capability to keep cables and pipelines safe.

These recent efforts complement NATO efforts that have been underway for several years. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg remarked on the importance of addressing the vulnerabilities of these cables, noting that most of them are privately owned and publicly known, making them potentially vulnerable.","The article titled ""Geopolitics and Climate Change Heighten Undersea Cable Concerns"" provides an in-depth discussion on undersea cables, specifically addressing the implications and risks associated with cable cuts.

It states that ""a single cable cut can bring down services of the major cloud providers"" and elaborates on the causes of such cuts, including fishing accidents, anchoring, and potential sabotage due to geopolitical tensions.

Additionally, it highlights concerns related to climate change affecting cable stability and the need for careful planning regarding cable routes.

Internet connectivity between parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe suddenly slowed on February 24 when three undersea cables were damaged in the Red Sea. This caused a significant impact on communication networks in the Middle East. The Red Sea is a choke point for global maritime trade—a fact Yemen’s Houthi rebels have taken advantage of by targeting global shipping with missile attacks in recent months. But the sea is also an internet and telecommunications bottleneck. An estimated 90 percent of communications between Europe and Asia and 17 percent of global internet traffic traverse cables under the 14-mile-wide Bab al Mandab Strait.

The Yemeni government warned in early February that Houthi rebels might target undersea cables. Although the rebels denied responsibility, it turned out they were culpable—just not in the way many had expected. According to U.S. officials, the cables were cut by the anchor of the sinking ship the Rubymar, a UK-owned commercial vessel that took on water after it was struck by a missile fired by the Houthis on February 18. The ship then dropped its anchor and drifted for several days. It finally sank on Saturday.

This is the latest of several recent incidents involving high-profile damage and disruption to undersea infrastructure. Internet cables near Svalbard and the Shetland Islands were cut in 2022, the same year the Nord Stream gas pipelines were sabotaged. Last year the Balticconnector pipeline between Finland and Estonia was damaged along with two subsea cables when the Chinese-owned commercial ship the Newnew Polar Bear dragged its anchor across them. These episodes highlight the vulnerability of vital undersea infrastructure around the world. The NATO alliance was so concerned it opened a new center last year for securing undersea infrastructure.

Around 97 percent of global data runs through a few hundred undersea cables. These cables are vital to the global information economy, spanning over 1.4 million kilometers and connecting nearly every country in the world. This number is growing as big tech companies lay and operate their own cables. Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft alone now control around half of all undersea bandwidth worldwide.

But seabed cables and other undersea infrastructure, like oil and gas pipelines or ocean wind farms, are vulnerable. As the Red Sea incident highlights, they are fast becoming the soft underbelly of the world economy. The scale and nature of this infrastructure makes it difficult to protect. Undersea infrastructure also makes a good target for those operating in the murky gray zone of deniable attacks short of war. For example, over 70 percent of cable faults are not intentional. Damage can be caused by fishing nets, anchors, weather, shark bites—and now sinking cargo ships. This makes it difficult to distinguish between accident and attack, something potential saboteurs can take advantage of to avoid detection. Cables and pipelines are also easy to locate as companies make their location public to aid navigation and minimize accidents.

Recent incidents show what is possible with these tactics. The 2022 Nord Stream explosions transformed the European energy landscape and sent political shockwaves across Europe, yet more than a year of investigations has yielded no firm conclusions. The 2023 Balticconnector incident was deemed likely by Finland to be an “intentional” attack, although investigations continue. The most recent Red Sea incident was judged ""an exceptionally rare occurrence,"" but it is one that is becoming more common as more undersea infrastructure is at risk to proliferating conflicts around the world.

No state actors have been implicated in these incidents, but several have advanced capabilities to target undersea infrastructure. The United Kingdom warned of Russia’s threat to undersea cables in 2017. Russia has long operated advanced capabilities for seabed sabotage and has recently been caught mapping European maritime infrastructure. Iran’s submarine fleet is small but potent and capable of Red Sea operations. China’s navy is now the world’s largest, and U.S. officials have expressed concern over the Chinese firm Huawei’s involvement in scores of global seabed cable projects, which could allow China to attach devices that divert or monitor data traffic—or, in a conflict, to sever links to entire nations.

There are no easy solutions for securing undersea infrastructure. Deterring gray zone aggression is difficult but not impossible. However, International governments and companies can act now in two important areas: boosting resilience and enhancing maritime domain awareness. Both would be furthered by improving public-private coordination, especially given the security and financial risks from vulnerable undersea infrastructure.

The best way to prevent attacks on vital and vulnerable undersea infrastructure is to build more resilient systems. As the UN principles for resilience infrastructure emphasize, new projects can be protected from the start by ensuring systems are hardened, fail-safe, have sufficient redundancy and are quickly recoverable. Since the 9/11 attacks, government buildings in the U.S. have been surrounded with simple measures like concrete bollards to prevent truck bombs. Airliners are equipped with locking, reinforced cockpit doors, for example. Protecting undersea infrastructure may require the same shift in mentality to proactive resilience by design.

However, true resilience is costly and impractical for existing cables that run thousands of kilometers along the seabed. If building resilience is a long-term endeavor, a short-term solution is to remove the cloak of ambiguity from hostile actors by enhancing maritime awareness. Much like the “you are being watched” signs under surveillance cameras, doing so would strengthen deterrence by detection—hostile actors are less likely to attack undersea.","The article titled ""Red Sea Cable Damage Reveals Soft Underbelly of Global Economy"" discusses the damage to three undersea cables in the Red Sea, which occurred on February 24, 2024.

**Content:**

Mystery attacks and data theft are at the forefront of the ongoing secret underwater battle for internet cables. At least 95% of internet data transfer occurs through around 500 submarine cables on the ocean floor. Major powers like the USA, Russia, and China are fiercely competing for control over these cables. Historical records indicate that the first attack on a submarine cable occurred in 1898 during the Spanish-American War, where the US warship ""Zafiro"" cut a cable connecting the Philippines to the Asian continent.

In recent years, there have been reports of attacks on cables between the UK and the USA and between France and the USA. In November 2021, investigators discovered that 4.3 kilometers of a cable off the coast of Norway had gone missing, and the incident remains unexplained.

Experts note that the increasing volume of data in these cables has spurred espionage and sabotage attempts. The growing costs of maintaining these cables have led to complex ownership structures involving multiple stakeholders, including state actors. Major tech companies are now constructing their own cables, further complicating the landscape.

The physical vulnerabilities of these cables have been largely overlooked in Europe, despite the increasing threats posed by powerful fishing nets and anchor drops. The recent leaks in the Baltic Sea pipelines have raised awareness about the risks faced by underwater infrastructure in hybrid warfare.

Europe is particularly vulnerable, lacking adequate monitoring and protection of its underwater cables. Experts advocate for improved cooperation between military and private sectors to enhance the security of these critical infrastructures, which are essential for global communication and economic transactions.

**Conclusion:**
The underwater battle for internet cables is not just a matter of connectivity; it involves national security, economic interests, and international power dynamics. As the stakes rise, so does the need for robust protection and strategic oversight of these vital resources.","The article discusses various incidents involving undersea cables, including historical and recent attacks, their causes, and the significant implications for internet connectivity and security.

**Author:** Tom Hunt  
**Published Date:** 02/22/2023  

Cook Strait's ferocious currents have been lifting a ""backbone"" communications cable from the sea floor as the search begins for a heftier replacement. Transpower – the state-owned enterprise that owns and runs the national grid – is now in the process of finding a company to supply up to 90 kilometres of fibre-optic cable to link the North and South islands.  

Tender documents show the existing cable is too light and lifts from the seabed because of the strait's high tidal flow. Burying the cables was not an option, as they were too close to the interisland electricity cables.  

Transpower is now investigating the cost for either one or two cables that were at least three times heavier, ""specifically designed for the conditions in Cook Strait"". The new cables, despite weighing up to 20 kilograms a metre, would also need to be flexible enough to contour to the sea floor.  

In a statement, Transpower's Cobus Nel said the two fibre-optic cables formed ""part of our communications backbone"". ""From our annual inspections, we have identified that one of the Transpower fibre-optic cables' condition is deteriorating, indicating that it is nearing end of life and a replacement strategy has been established (as per normal business practice with all our assets).  

""We have discovered certain sections of these cables are moving more than other sections, due to tidal movements in the strait: this has caused some corrosion in parts of the cable.""  

The cables were originally installed in 1992, and replaced in 2003. One of the cables – or perhaps two if it was more cost-effective – would likely be replaced in the next one to two years, he said. ""Given our knowledge of the condition of these cables, and our contingency measures, we do not believe there is any imminent risk to the operation of the national grid.""  

Niwa and Auckland University marine physics principal scientist Craig Stevens said the Cook Strait tides ripped through at up to three metres a second, or about 10kmh.  

Telecommunications Users Association of New Zealand chief executive Craig Young said there were multiple cables between the North and South islands so an outage on one would not cause a major issue. But having cables lying on the sea floor made them vulnerable – for example, if a boat's anchor pulled them up.  

A Spark spokeswoman said it owned one of the three cables between the North and South islands, which was upgraded last July. It sometimes used the Transpower cable when it needed extra space.  

**Conclusion:** The article emphasizes the critical importance of the Cook Strait cables for communication and the proactive measures being taken to ensure their integrity amidst challenging environmental conditions.","The article discusses the challenges faced by a communications cable in the Cook Strait due to extreme tidal currents.

It mentions that the existing cable is too light, leading it to be lifted from the seabed, and describes the deterioration of the cable caused by tidal movements, indicating potential risks akin to those of cut cables.

Kiger",Yes,"Patrick J. Kiger","Atlanta, Georgia, United States","15000","2018-01-04","English","HowStuffWorks, LLC","**Could an Attack on Undersea Cables Take Down the Internet?**  

The head of the British defense establishment and chairman of NATO's military committee, Air Marshall Sir Stuart Peach, recently warned that cutting the cables ""would immediately — and catastrophically — fracture both international trade and the internet,"" according to the Guardian.  

Peach's warning echoed the conclusions of a 2017 report written by U.K. Member of Parliament Rishi Sunak, which described the potential for disruption of internet traffic as an ""existential threat."" Sunak noted that the cables, which are largely owned and operated by private companies, transmit $10 trillion in financial transfers each day.  

It's not the first time that an alarm has been sounded about the undersea cable networks. This 2010 report written for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security describes the effects of a 2008 incident in which three cables in the Mediterranean that connected Italy to Egypt were severed, apparently accidentally by commercial ships dragging their anchors. Eighty percent of the internet connectivity between Europe and the Middle East temporarily was lost. As a result, most of the U.S. Air Force's drone aircraft in Iraq were grounded, due to the lack of a reliable connection to technicians back in the U.S. ""Cable breaks halfway across the world threaten U.S. vital national security interests,"" the report warned.  

In 2015, The New York Times reported that a Russian spy ship, the Yantar, was kept under surveillance by U.S. planes, satellites and ships as it cruised slowly down the U.S. east coast, close to internet cables. The Russian ship reportedly was equipped with two miniature submarines capable of going into deep water to cut cables. Another Russian surveillance ship, the Viktor Leonov, was spotted off the coast of Delaware in February, according to the Christian Science Monitor.  

But before you get too caught up in a nightmare scenario of the internet suddenly going dark due to sabotage, experts say the system — despite its lack of defenses — is resilient and would be difficult for an enemy nation or terrorist group to disable. The fiber cables that transmit the world's data are surprisingly slim, measuring less than 0.7 inches (17 millimeters) in thickness. But the fiber is encased in a hermetically sealed tube, which is in turn surrounded by layers of high-tensile steel wires, copper and polyethylene. For sections in shallower water, where cables are more likely to encounter ship anchors and other manmade hazards, additional layers of armor are sometimes added, or else cables are buried under the seabed.  

As a result, cables are damaged worldwide only about 200 times a year — ""a tiny failure rate across a network of well over a million kilometers (621,000 miles) of cable linking people between continents.""  

It would be difficult to cut cables in the deep ocean, though a robotic submersible equipped with the right tools could pull it off. The cable networks are more vulnerable closer to land, where their connections are in shallower water and easier to reach. It wouldn't take a lot of sophisticated weapons or know-how to inflict the desired damage.  

""If you want to interrupt communications, you hire a crappy old fishing trawler, give them a big anchor and tell them to drag it here.""","The article 'Could an Attack on Undersea Cables Take Down the Internet?' extensively discusses undersea cables, their vulnerabilities, and the implications of cutting them.

It includes direct mentions of 'undersea cables' and outlines significant historical incidents where cable severance disrupted internet connectivity, such as the 2008 incident that affected communication between Europe and the Middle East.

Maybe you've been scrolling through our blogs about recent cable breaks. Or perhaps it just feels like there's been an uptick of cable fault chatter online. Either way, disruptions to service have made their way into a few spring headlines.

But it's worth remembering that where there have been faults, there have also been repairs.

From recent returns to service in Egypt to other repairs in South Africa, ingrained processes and contingency plans have been responsible for recovered service on a number of key subsea cable systems.

Repairing cables is simply part of the process for a cable-dependent society. And we've gotten good at it!

There's a reason that we rarely hear about these cable faults—and that recent headlines are more of an exception than the rule. It's because most companies that use cables follow a “safety in numbers” approach to usage, spreading their networks' capacity over multiple cables. If one breaks, their network will run smoothly over other cables while service is restored on the damaged one.

Accidents like fishing vessels and ships dragging anchors account for two-thirds of all cable faults. Environmental factors like earthquakes also contribute to damage. In the recent example out of Egypt, service was interrupted as a result of terrestrial cable cuts resulting from an unusually powerful storm.

And let's consider the context. As of 2020, we believe there are over 1.2 million kilometers of submarine cables in service globally. Even though we don't always hear about them, cable faults are common. On average, there are over 100 each year.

WION (World Is One News) - Book and Periodical Publishing company with 253 employees, headquartered in Noida, IN. WION - WORLD IS ONE. Welcome to India's first global news network. We present global stories with an Indian perspective.

**Story highlights**  
It must be noted that there are more than 15 submarine internet cables in the Red Sea, a region witnessing massive shipping disruption due to attacks by Yemen-based Houthi rebels in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war.

Submarine internet cables have been “cut” in the Red Sea, causing “significant” disruption to communications networks in the Middle East, said Hong Kong telecoms company HGC Global Communications. Cables belonging to four major operators have been cut, which might impact internet traffic in India, Pakistan, and parts of East Africa as well. HGC Global claims at least 25 per cent of the traffic has been impacted and operators were now rerouting traffic to keep disruptions to a minimum and “extending assistance to affected businesses"".

The company said it was “extremely rare” to have four cables damaged simultaneously.

**Cause of the cuts**  
None of the operators have yet disclosed the reason behind the cuts. Yemen also denied its role in the suspected sabotage, saying it was “keen to keep all telecom submarine cables…away from any possible risks.”

However, the West-backed Yemeni government in previous weeks had warned that Houthi rebels might seek to disrupt these cables to show support for Hamas and force the world to press Israel to stop attacks in Gaza.

Yemeni rebel leader Abdel Malek al-Houthi denied the allegations. “We have no intention of targeting sea cables providing internet to countries in the region,” he said.

Houthis on the other hand have accused British and US military units operating there of being behind the suspected sabotage.

**When are repairs expected?**  
CNN quoted South Africa-based Seacom, which owns one of the cable systems affected, as saying that the repair work won’t start for at least another month, as it needed to secure permits to operate in the sea.

Meanwhile, the continued security crisis in the Red Sea might also induce further delay in the repair work.

Underwater cables serve as the backbone of the internet, often financed in recent years by tech titans like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook. Disruptions to these subsea networks can lead to extensive internet blackouts, as seen in the aftermath of the Taiwan earthquake in 2006.

An entire country was left without internet access for two days after an undersea cable was damaged.

Mauritania was left offline for 48 hours after the African Coast to Europe (ACE) submarine cable was severed, according to infrastructure analysts. Nine other west African nations were affected by outages.

The cable system stretches 10,500 miles (17,000 kilometres) from France to South Africa, helping to provide internet connection to 22 countries – mostly on Africa’s west coast.

A large part of the west of the continent was affected by outages, first reported on 30 March, after the cable broke near the Mauritanian capital Noukachott. It is thought to have been snapped by a trawler.

Mauritania, which relies solely on ACE to stay connected, was left offline for 48 hours, according to internet performance firm Dyn.

Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, and the Gambia also experienced significant disruption, while Benin, Senegal, Equatorial Guinea and the Ivory Coast all saw less serious problems.

“The most significant, and longest-lasting disruption was seen in Mauritania, with a complete outage lasting for nearly 48 hours, followed by partial restoration of connectivity,” said David Belson, senior director of internet research and analysis at Dyn.

He added: “The differences in duration and severity may be related to the other international internet connections, via terrestrial cable or satellite, that the providers in these countries have in place, resulting in varying levels of reliance on the ACE cable system.”

The director of networks and international services at Orange, which heads the consortium of 19 organisations which manage ACE, tweeted a picture of the severed cable taken by workers on a maintenance vessel sent to repair it.

Jean-Luc Vuillemin said a trawler raising the cable off the seabed and slicing through it was the “likely cause” of the “major breakdown”.

It is the first major outage since ACE became operational in 2012.

The head of the UK’s armed forces last year warned of the vulnerability of undersea communication cables, which he said could be targeted by aggressors such as Russia.

Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, the chief of the UK defence staff, said Moscow’s ability to interfere with deep-sea cables posed a potentially “catastrophic threat” to the internet and international trade.

"SA’s Internet Outage Due to WACS Cable Break","Major internet outages across all South African ISPs following the second WACS undersea cable break this year, impacting connectivity during COVID-19 lockdown.","https://gadget.co.za/sas-internet-goes-down-again","","Arthur Goldstuck",Yes,"Arthur Goldstuck","South Africa",-,"2020-03-28","English","GadgetZA","**Title:** SA’s Internet goes down again  
**Author:** Arthur Goldstuck  
**Published Date:** 03/28/2020  

Internet service provider Afrihost has notified customers that there are major outages across all South African Internet Service Providers (ISPs), as a result of a break in the WACS undersea cable between Portugal and England.

The cause of the cable break along the cable is unclear. It marks the second major breakage event along the West African Internet sea cables this year, and comes at the worst possible time: as South Africans grow heavily dependent on their Internet connections during the COVID-19 lockdown.

As a result of the break, the use of international websites and services, which include VPNs (virtual private networks), may result in latency – decreased speeds and response times.

WACS runs from Yzerfontein in the Western Cape, up the West Coast of Africa, and terminates in the United Kingdom. It makes a stop in Portugal before it reaches the UK, and the breakage is reportedly somewhere between these two countries.

The cable is owned in portions by several companies, and the portion where the breakage has occurred belongs to Tata Communications.

The alternate routes are:

* SAT3, which runs from Melkbosstrand also in the Western Cape, up the West Coast and terminates in Portugal and Spain. This cable runs nearly parallel to WACS and has less Internet capacity than WACS.
* ACE (Africa Coast to Europe), which also runs up the West Coast.
* The SEACOM cable runs from South Africa, up the East Coast of Africa, terminating in both London and Dubai.
* The EASSy cable also runs from South Africa, up the East Coast, terminating in Sudan, from where it connects to other cables.

The routes most ISPs in South Africa use are WACS and SAT3, due to cost reasons.

The impact will not be as severe as in January, though. All international traffic is being redirected via alternative cable routes. This may be a viable method for connecting users to the Internet but might not be suitable for latency-sensitive applications like International video conferencing.","The article titled 'SA’s Internet goes down again' discusses a break in the WACS undersea cable, which is directly related to the topic of cut sea cables.

A report from Taiwan indicates that China can incapacitate Taiwan's network system with the outside world by damaging undersea fiber optic cables. According to Tseng Yi-shuo, an acting director at the National Defense Security Research Institute, there are two main methods through which China could launch cyber attacks on Taiwan:

1. **Direct Destruction**: China could directly damage the undersea fiber optic cables that connect Taiwan to the outside world, which are laid at depths of less than 300 meters and have four landing stations in Taiwan.

2. **Domain Name Manipulation**: China could also pressure the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to change Taiwan's domain name from '.tw' to '.cn'. This change would not only affect Taiwan's international internet identity but could also allow China to hijack the Border Gateway Protocol, potentially capturing and monitoring all data entering and exiting Taiwan.

Furthermore, experts from Nikkei Asia Review suggest that China views Taiwan as a testing ground for cyber warfare, with the ultimate goal of influencing U.S. politics. Tseng notes that while China's current influence on U.S. politics is less than that of Russia, it is using Taiwan to gather knowledge and test algorithms, which may enable it to disrupt U.S. elections within two years.

"Undersea Cables: The Fragile Lifelines of the Internet","Explores significant incidents of undersea cable cuts, including a 2000 fishing boat anchor event and a 2006 Taiwan earthquake, illustrating their critical role in global communication.","https://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/untersee-kabel-die-fragilen-lebensadern-des-internets-a-1015809.html","","Frank Patalong, DER SPIEGEL",Yes,"Frank Patalong","Hamburg, Germany","200000","2015-02-02","German","DER SPIEGEL","**Undersea Cables: The Fragile Lifelines of the Internet**  

There is a legend about the Internet that the global network is self-repairing. If a data path fails, the bits and bytes simply find another way to reach their destination.  

In theory, this might be true. In practice, the Internet and international telephone networks come to a halt when around 200 cables are cut. Probably even fewer would be enough to cause stock markets to collapse and entire continents to be cut off from the rest of the world.  

**Here are a few examples:**  

- **2000:** A fishing boat drops anchor and tears a fiber optic cable. Southeast Asia, Japan, and Australia lose a significant portion of their network capacity.  
- **2006:** An earthquake near Taiwan breaks cables. 120 million phone connections in East Asia go offline, the Internet switches to snail mode, and banks and stock exchanges are cut off from international trade. At times, foreign currency trading must be suspended worldwide.  
- **2008:** A bizarre series of mishaps in the Arab world. Cables break twice off Egypt and twice in the Persian Gulf within a few days. The entire region remains offline for 18 days, leaving up to 100 million people completely disconnected.  
- **2010:** An anchor tears a cable off South Africa. International telecommunications and the Internet collapse.  
- **2012:** Telecommunications in East Africa sinks with the anchor of a ship.  

Some undersea cables fall victim to natural disasters, while others may be the result of sabotage. However, the main cause of severed important data lines are accidents involving trawl nets and boat anchors.  

The most curious case occurred in 2011 on land: A 75-year-old retiree allegedly sawed through a cable to sell it as scrap. The republics of Armenia and Georgia went offline, but the retiree denied the allegations.  

**Cyberwar? Much easier and worse than thought**  

Such a total collapse could even happen without violence. At least the international connections could be easily shut down by the USA due to their central access to the root server system of the Internet and their position in the transcontinental telephone cable routes. The extent of the US intelligence agency NSA's access to international cable routes has been confirmed by Edward Snowden's revelations. A look at the maps that document the international undersea cables makes it clear that only a surprisingly few connection points are needed for espionage or sabotage.  

Wireless technologies and satellites play a marginal role in data transport. They are in no way sufficient or suitable to replace the wires that connect us. The airy allegory of the ""Cloud"" is a distorted image: Our data is stored at physical locations, connected by often only arm-thick cables.  

However, these cables have a significant impact. For instance, Australia and New Zealand are connected to Southeast Asia by an undersea fiber optic cable that can handle 20 million phone calls simultaneously.  

**The Achilles' heel of the modern world**  

What sounds impressive also makes us remarkably vulnerable: The cable routes are likely the critical infrastructures where the highest damage can be done with the least effort.  

There are redundant structures that can cushion failures, but ultimately, the underwater infrastructures are stretched thin—understandable, considering that each route costs billions. The undersea cables are the Achilles' heel of network structures.  

Such information is rarely heard or read. Perhaps because laying cables is far less sexy than launching satellites into orbit? At least that's what Nicole Starosielski believes, who aims to raise awareness of how fragile our network infrastructures are with her book ""The Undersea Network"" announced for mid-March.  

Almost 20 years after Neal Stephenson's epochal cable report ""Mother Earth Mother Board,"" the journalist embarks on a portrait of the global cable routes—also exploring their economic, social, ecological, and political effects and side effects. This includes the web project Surfacing, which aims to provide a map, illustrated catalog, and information database on the subject of undersea cables starting in mid-March.  

In many cases, their routes are the same as those of the first copper cables laid in the 19th century, Starosielski reports. Often, there are ""cables on cables.""  

This fits with the latest maps just released by TeleGeography: modern maps in the style of ancient world maps. But whether modern or nostalgic, following the cable routes is enlightening. Perhaps one day, even the million-euro question at Günther Jauch's show will be: ""Through how many undersea cable access points is Germany connected to the Internet?""  

**A small tip:** Say five.","The article discusses multiple incidents involving undersea cables, detailing specific events where cables were cut and the resulting impacts on global communication.

It mentions significant historical examples, such as the 2000 incident with a fishing boat's anchor and the 2006 earthquake near Taiwan, illustrating the fragility and critical importance of these cables.

The focus on the causes and consequences of cable cuts further supports its relevance to the criterion."
"Ship's Anchor Causes Internet Cable Cut","Significant outages in the Middle East and Asia due to a ship's anchor cutting cables in the Persian Gulf, 35 miles north of Dubai.","https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna23068571","","By By Katarina Kratovac",Yes,"Katarina Kratovac","New York, NY, USA","10000","2008-02-08","English","NBC News","A ship's anchor lying at the bottom of the sea was behind one of two cuts last week in undersea Internet cables around the Middle East that caused dramatic outages across the region and in parts of Asia, the cable-owner company said Friday.

FLAG Telecom said its repair ship managed to recover one end of the cut FALCON cable in the Persian Gulf, 35 miles north of Dubai, between the Emirates and Oman.

At the site, FLAG's repair crew discovered an abandoned anchor which the company said was behind the cut last Friday. The anchor, weighing more than 5 tons, was pulled up to the surface.

It was not immediately clear whether FLAG had any indication what vessel the anchor belonged to, or how such a heavy anchor could have moved to snap the cable or whether the cable itself was drifting and why.

At the time of the cut — the second in three days and involving three separate Internet cables — rough weather was reported in that part of the Gulf.

The unusual cuts led to disruptions in services, slowed down businesses and hampered personal Internet usage. They also caused a flurry of Internet blogger speculation, including mentions of sabotage — allegations authorities and FLAG have refused to comment.

""It is difficult to comment right now on this,"" said a FLAG spokesman, reached over the telephone. ""We are doing our own investigation."" He spoke on condition of anonymity, in line with company policy.

Ovum analyst Matt Walker said undersea cable networks are highly vulnerable to deliberate attack and need enhanced security.

""If ports, railways, gas pipelines, and other types of networks are being secured against possible sabotage, we must similarly increase the security of undersea optical highways,"" said Walker.

The cuts also underlined potential threats that disrupted Internet connectivity could pose to organizations and businesses worldwide. Large-scale Internet disruptions are rare, but East Asia suffered nearly two months of outages and slow service after an earthquake damaged undersea cables near Taiwan in December 2006.

""The economic cost of losing, or even just slowing down, international communications is extremely high,"" said Walker. ""This risk has to be factored into the calculations behind the investment level and design of undersea optical networks.""

FLAG said it has fully restored circuits to some customers and switched others to alternative routes.

The FLAG repair ship is trying to reconnect the Persian Gulf cable and repairs are expected to be done by Sunday. Weather conditions have improved and are now moderate, FLAG said.

Meanwhile, a second flag repair ship continued repair work off the north coast of Egypt, where the first undersea cable was cut Jan. 30, some 5.2 miles from the Egyptian port city of Alexandria.

That cut sliced two cables — the FLAG Europe-Asia cable, owned by FLAG, which stands for Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe, and another cable lying next to it, identified as SEA-ME-WE 4, or South East Asia-Middle East-West Europe 4 cable, owned by a consortium of 16 international telecommunication companies.

It was still not known what caused that cut, on a very narrow route linking Egypt and Palermo, on the Italian island of Sicily. Egypt's telecommunication ministry said no ships were registered near the location when the cut happened north of Alexandria.

FLAG, in a statement posted on the company Web site, said it had completed a survey of the cable cut off Egypt that involved ""tracking along the cable path and checking for cuts using remotely operated"" submarine robots.

The results of the survey were not revealed, but FLAG added these repairs would also be completed Sunday.

Earlier, the FLAG spokesman said that a new undersea cable — the FLAG Mediterranean Cable — was being laid between Egypt and France, that would be ""fully resilient"" against cuts such as last week's and ""provide a diversity in routes."" He did not elaborate what that resilience entailed, but said it would take months to set up the new cable.

Also, state Telecom Egypt said it sealed a $125 million contract on Jan. 31 with French-American telecommunications equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent, for a new 1,900 miles long undersea cable between Egypt and France.

That submarine cable, named TE North, will link Sidi Kerir on Egypt's northern coast to the French port of Marseille.

It will have multiple times the bandwidth capacity of existing cables and enable Telecom Egypt to ""expand international connectivity, providing diversity from existing cable routes.""

If China Attacks Taiwan's Undersea Cables, It Could Disrupt International Financial Markets**  

On December 15, 2016, Japan's NEC Corporation announced the completion of a high-capacity optical fiber submarine cable, which will accelerate the connectivity speed in Asia.  

An article in the U.S. magazine ""The National Interest"" points out that undersea cables are a critical vulnerability for Taiwan. If attacked by mainland China, it would disrupt international business and financial markets, severely impacting Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, and Australia.  

Former Deputy Minister of National Defense, Huang Yin-shan, in an article for ""The National Interest,"" stated that while undersea cables are the backbone of today's global data and voice communications, they are surprisingly fragile.  

She noted that if a conflict occurs in the Taiwan Strait, undersea cables would become a primary target for China. Cutting these cables would paralyze Taiwan's international communications, with damage extending beyond Taiwan itself.  

There are at least ten international undersea cables connecting Taiwan with Asia-Pacific countries. Attacking these cables would disrupt international business and financial markets, severely affecting regional economies such as Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, and Australia.  

China's cable strategy poses serious security implications for the U.S., Taiwan, and the Asia-Pacific region.  

The ""Undersea Great Wall"" that China is building includes many underwater sensors that connect cables to central processing and monitoring facilities located in Shanghai, forming an irreplaceable part of China's underwater observation system in the South China Sea, potentially undermining U.S. military advantages in the area.  

Since September 2016, China Telecom has replaced satellite stations in the Spratly Islands with 4G optical fiber cable stations. Optical fiber cables provide faster and more stable transmission speeds than satellite systems.  

This construction began just two months after the Hague arbitration court made a unanimous ruling unfavorable to China regarding territorial claims in the South China Sea. These optical fiber cable stations significantly enhance China's jurisdiction and control capabilities in the South China Sea.  

The article states that the U.S. and Asia-Pacific allies should monitor the security of cable routes, using automatic identification systems to accurately locate damage, and should establish multilateral cooperation mechanisms to avoid delays in cable repairs.  

These efforts will, to some extent, counter China's quietly developing capabilities that could disrupt the region and help prevent Taiwan from becoming the most vulnerable point in the Asia-Pacific undersea cable network.","The article titled ""致命弱點！陸若攻台海底電纜 恐擾亂國際金融市場"" discusses the vulnerabilities of undersea cables, particularly in the context of potential attacks by China on Taiwan's undersea infrastructure.

A severe internet outage that has hit several African countries - the third disruption in four months - is a stark reminder of how vulnerable the service is on the continent.

Questions are being asked about how the reliability of what has become an essential tool in nearly every aspect of life can be improved.

A cut to two of the undersea cables, which carry the data around the continent, early on Sunday morning, led to the recent disruption.

In March, damage to four cables off the West African coast caused similar problems.

And in February, the vital links were damaged in the Red Sea after the anchor of a stricken ship dragged through three cables.

Investigations are under way into this weekend’s case. But it was also likely to have been caused by “an anchor drag” from a ship, Prenesh Padayachee, chief digital and operations officer at Seacom, which owns one of the two cables affected, told the BBC.

The second cable, known as Eassy, was affected at the same time and at the same place. The incident happened off the South African coast, just north of the port city of Durban, according to the Communications Authority of Kenya (CAK).

The capacity of the infrastructure connecting Africa to the rest of the world has improved in recent years and telecoms companies are switching to other cables to maintain the service.

In Kenya, for example, the CAK said that local internet traffic was currently using The East Africa Marine System (Teams) cable that was not affected.

While Kenya has alternatives, other countries, such as Tanzania where connectivity levels hit 30% of what they were expected to be, do not.

The data should be able to find other routes, but when there is a limited number of pathways the service gets jammed and slows down.

Cases of cable damage are increasing but that is because the number of connections has also gone up.

“A lot of people don’t realise that the internet is held up by these cables that are like garden hosepipes except it’s one that stretches 10,000km, and that means that they are quite fragile,” Dr Jess Auerbach Jahajeeah, a researcher into digital connectivity at the University of Cape Town, told the BBC’s Focus on Africa programme.

Anchor dragging from ships close to shore is one of the most common causes of damage, but underwater rockfalls, as was believed to be the case in West Africa in March, and seismic activity can also affect the cables.

As “many of these subsea cables are often quite close to each other, then one activity on the ocean floor or one ship can damage multiple cables at the same time”, industry expert Ben Roberts said.

Repairing the damage, which requires specialised equipment and expertise, can take days or weeks, depending on the weather, sea conditions and the extent of the problem.

It took more than a month, for example, for the four severed West African internet cables to be repaired and returned to service.

“We are working on a temporary capacity solution to ensure connectivity is reinstated to the affected regions,” said Mr Padayachee from Seacom.

He added that they were “actively collaborating with various parties to expedite the repair process”.

Cable repair ship the Léon Thévenin, that had been docked in Cape Town, is being sent to the site of the damage and should be there in three days, said Chris Wood, who runs a company that has invested in Eassy.

Despite an increase in connections, Africa's reliance on a limited number of undersea cables for the internet makes the continent more susceptible to disruptions and exacerbates their impact.

Europe and North America, on the other hand, have a dense network of high-capacity overland and undersea cables that diversify connectivity routes and improve resilience.

While discussions have been ongoing to address Africa's internet infrastructure challenges, progress has been slow because of logistical and financial constraints.

Dr Jahajeeah said one problem was that the support systems to repair the growing number of cables around the continent had not kept up with the growth.

While other ships can help out, the Léon Thévenin is the only repair ship dedicated to servicing Africa.

“The [ship] used to do two or three repairs a year [but] last year it did nine… and there is a real need for African governments and global governments to get together and say we need to ensure that there is no digital divide,” Dr Jahajeeah said.

Some people have proposed alternatives such as satellite internet links to bolster digital resilience. Elon Musk's Starlink project, for example, aims to provide high-speed internet to people who live in remote areas via a network of satellites. But is very expensive and currently not available everywhere.

The answer really lies in greater investment on the ground to support the vital communications infrastructure.

“It needs more networks, more connectivity, more data centres and more internet exchanges to make sure that we have a diverse connectivity,” said Mr Roberts.","The article discusses multiple incidents involving cuts to undersea cables, specifically mentioning two cables that were cut off the South African coast, which led to a significant internet outage affecting several African countries.

It details the causes of these disruptions, including anchor drags from ships, and emphasizes the fragility of these cables, which are critical for internet connectivity in Africa.

The article further elaborates on the consequences of these cuts, such as reduced connectivity levels in countries like Tanzania and the challenges faced in repairing the damage.

Sharks, Ships Have An Appetite for Undersea Fiber Optic Cables**  
With thousands of satellites in orbit communicating with us at the speed of light, 99% percent of international data is transmitted by cables crisscrossing the bottom of our oceans. In total, there are hundreds of thousands of miles of both copper and fiber-optic cables currently on the ocean floor. While transmitting information via satellite may seem much easier and more reliable than undersea cables, fiber optic cables deliver information at a much lower cost than our most advanced satellites today.

In shallow waters, voice and data transmission cables are buried beneath the ocean floor using high pressure water jets to dig trenches. In deeper water, where the environment is more stable, they are typically laid on top of the ocean floor, with care taken to avoid coral reefs, sunken ships, and other potentially damaging obstructions. There is one underwater hazard that wasn’t originally seen as a danger to underwater communications but has proven to cause millions of dollars in damage to undersea fiber optic lines – sharks.

Reports of sharks biting undersea cables date back to 1987. It was then that the New York Times reported “sharks have shown an inexplicable taste for the new fiber-optic cables that are being strung along the ocean floor linking the United States, Europe, and Japan.”

AT&T also encountered problems after they laid a trial optical cable, TAT-8, in the Canary Islands in 1983. This cable did not have an electrical screen and was attacked by sharks. It was never proved whether these attacks were due to the sharks sensing the electrical radiation from the cable or the vibration of the cable moving on the sea floor where it might have been suspended. TAT-8 did have the screen conductor because of the possible effect of shark attacks. Because the cable was the first fiber optic cable and not coaxial cable, the electrical interference shielding for the high voltage supply lines was removed. This removal did not affect the fiber, but it did cause feeding frenzies in sharks that swam nearby. The sharks would then attack the cable until the voltage lines killed them. This caused numerous, prolonged outages. Eventually, a shark shielding was developed for the cable. PTAT-1, the next cable to go in the Atlantic was put in with the shark shielding and it proved much more reliable than TAT-8.

The first conclusive evidence of sharks’ attraction to fiber optic cables was found in 1985, when shark teeth were found embedded in an experimental data line off the Canary Islands. That same year, shark bites caused the failure of four segments of cable in the Atlantic ocean, raising curiosity as to why it may be happening.

The website oAfrica, which tracks digital news on the continent, theorized in 2009 that the emission of electricity from the fiber cables may attract the sharks, who mistake the currents for prey.

""Unlike short-haul terrestrial fiber cables or old copper cables where the fiber did not emit noticeable fields, undersea cables must carry high voltage power to the undersea repeaters, which result in both electric and magnetic fields around and along the cable… Some sharks mistake the electric fields for distressed fish and attempt to feed on the cable.""

Dr. Chris Lowe, one of the founders of the Shark Lab at California State University, Long Beach believes that sharks bite the cables for a different reason, and told Wired that sharks may just be curious about the cables. “If you had just a piece of plastic out there shaped like a cable, there’s a good chance they’d bite that too,” said Dr. Lowe in the interview.

Whether through natural curiosity or in search of a meal, Google is attempting to prevent damage to their cables, and for good reason – they currently own over 100,000 miles of private fiber optic routes around the world, including 5,000 miles fiber-optic cables spanning the Pacific.

Dan Belcher, a product manager on the Google cloud team, said that Google goes to great lengths to protect its infrastructure, including wrapping its trans-Pacific underwater cables in Kevlar to prevent against shark attacks and other damage.

In South Africa, the results of the testing showed that the layers of 0.15 millimeter steel and a high density 0.05 millimeter polyethylene jacket protect that insulation from shark attack. Generally, sharks do not feed below 1,500m, so only cables shallower than this depth need extra reinforcement.

But are sharks really the threat they’re made out to be? The International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) doesn’t seem to think so, and it’s likely that once again, sharks aren’t the villains they’re made out to be.

""The International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) has reviewed records of cable faults worldwide, and together with an assessment of the video, conclude that much of the media hype was incorrect. Essentially, sharks and other fish were responsible for less than one percent of all cable faults up to 2006. Since then, no such cable faults have been recorded,"" the group said in a message.

The group also said that ""expert advice suggests the cable was attacked by a six-gill, blunt nose shark (Hexanchus griseus), which took one bite and swam away. The cable sustained no obvious external damage and is unlikely to have suffered internal damage.""

A look at the damages to undersea cables shows that most threats to cables, however, do not come from apex predators at all. 70 percent of undersea cable faults are caused by ship anchors and fishing trawlers that inadvertently snag a cable, with another 10-15 percent of damage from natural disasters like earthquakes, underwater landslides, or tidal currents dragging lines underwater. Most undersea data connections have redundancy built into them to help avoid outages, however even the most minor repairs can cost millions of dollars and result in network slowdowns.

The action has been brought by GTT Communications and related entities Hibernia Express Ireland Ltd and Hibernia Atlantic Cable System Limited which run between Ireland, the UK and Canada.

The court heard the cables carry data from some of the largest financial firms, telecommunications firms and cloud operators. One cable carries information key to traders on the global stock markets.

The companies claim the owners of several fishing vessels have been trawling in the waters near the cables, allegedly posing a high risk of damage to the cables.

The companies claim the defendants’ actions also place the trawler crews in danger as the cables are charged and there is a history of vessels sinking having had their fishing equipment caught in subsea cables. The cable owners seek various orders against Brendan, Denis, James and John O’Flaherty, as alleged registered owners of several fishing vessels operating out of Kilmore Quay in Co Wexford.

The orders sought include an injunction restraining them trawling, dropping anchor or interfering with the seabed within 1km of the cables until the full dispute has been determined.

The applicants claim the cables at risk from the fishermen’s alleged actions are the “segment D cable” which runs from Sutton, Dublin, via the Irish Sea, before making its way west to Halifax, in Nova Scotia, Canada.

The defendants oppose the applications and say there is no basis in law that would allow a court to make such orders. The orders would prevent them from engaging in lawful fishing activities, they say. Another cable allegedly at risk is the Hibernia express cable, which runs between Brean in the UK, lands in Co Cork, before running on to Halifax. Ciaran Lewis SC, for the companies, said the matter was urgent.

His clients, following a number of incidents, had asked the defendants to cease fishing near the cables, but they had failed to do so. The cables, he said, are extremely expensive to repair when damaged and varied from €600,000 to €1.4 million for every repair.

Darren Lehane SC, for the fishermen, said they are currently out at sea and he was not in a position to give any undertakings to the court until they were able to speak with them. The matter is complex and should be heard by the judge designated to hear admiralty matters, he said.

Ms Justice Leonie Reynolds acknowledged the urgency of the matter given the serious claims made in relation to health and safety. She said the matter could not be heard until after the Easter holidays. She adjourned it to later this week with a view to fixing a hearing date for the dispute.","The article discusses legal actions taken by undersea cable owners against fishermen trawling near their cables, highlighting risks of damage to the cables and the history of incidents involving fishing equipment getting caught.

The claim spread after Taiwan's coast guard detained the Togolese-registered ship Hongtai and its Chinese captain for severing an undersea telecoms cable serving the Penghu island group in the sensitive Taiwan Strait. The coast guard said the Hongtai was among 52 ""suspicious"" Chinese-owned ships flying flags of convenience from Mongolia, Cameroon, Tanzania, Togo and Sierra Leone highlighted for close monitoring. Vessels suspected of loitering or anchoring near subsea cables will be warned by radio to leave the area, and boarding inspections will be conducted when needed.

Taipei fears Beijing -- which claims the self-ruled island as part of its territory and has threatened to use force to bring it under its control -- could sever its communication links as part of an attempt to seize or blockade the island.

While Taiwan's defence ministry issued notice of a planned drill to the southeast of the Penghu island group on March 24, and warned fisherman to avoid the area for their own safety, the ministry told the state-run Central News Agency (CNA) that ""no live-free shooting will be carried out in the sea and air exercise area"".

A keyword search on the website of the Taiwan president's office also found no order to open fire in the area where the Chinese ships had reportedly lingered. A reverse image search on Google found the photo of Lai used in the false posts predates the detention of the Hongtai, and has circulated in CNA reports since March 2023.

CNA told AFP in a March 20 email that the image is one of the agency's archived images.","The article discusses a significant incident involving the severing of an undersea telecommunications cable by a Chinese-crewed vessel, detailing the actions taken by the Taiwanese coast guard in response.

**Published Date:** 06/24/2024  
**Authors:** Jack Detsch; Keith Johnson  
  
There are just two cables linking the remote Arctic archipelago of Svalbard with mainland Norway, providing almost all the data from polar-orbiting satellites to the rest of the world. And two years ago, they nearly stopped working.  
  
Norwegian police images released in late May show the catastrophic damage done to one of the Svalbard fiber optic cables: the plastic casing slashed open, the cable exposed, and wires unfurled like a faulty electrical cord.  
  
The unsolved January 2022 incident, which cut data flow from the SvalSat satellites and limited air traffic to the archipelago, is serving as a cautionary tale about what can happen when undersea cables—which underpin most of the global communications network—are cut. Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels did just that earlier this year when they targeted a key bottleneck between Asia, Africa, and Europe.  
  
The threat is not just limited to one or two areas. NATO officials believe that Russia has a decadeslong program to map out European undersea infrastructure as part of an effort to prepare the battlefield for a possible conflict with the 32-nation alliance.  
  
In response, NATO now has an undersea infrastructure coordination group that brings together military and civilian officials and has the power to convene top representatives from the private sector.  
  
The strategy of cutting undersea cables is almost as old as modern warfare. The first trans-Atlantic cables had been laid in 1866. Britain began cutting German undersea cables at the outset of World War I to sabotage communications.  
  
With fiber optic cables becoming the ubiquitous plumbing that underpins global communications and trade in the internet age, the vulnerability in the seabed is growing. Norway’s undersea pipeline network provides about 40 percent of Europe’s natural gas supply, with pipelines crisscrossing the North Sea to the United Kingdom and the rest of the continent.  
  
About 100 of those cables break globally every year—most by accident—and it’s basically impossible to protect all of that infrastructure.  
  
The concern for that infrastructure has led to the NATO effort, which began after the September 2022 attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines.  
  
Some experts believe that smaller groups of countries can move faster than NATO to protect the cables. Norway and five other countries bordering the North Sea agreed to share operational information to protect undersea cables and pipelines against sabotage.  
  
In the face of all the other challenges, all of our economy under the sea is under threat, Vice-Adm. Didier Maleterre, the deputy commander of the NATO maritime command, said in April.","The article discusses the vulnerabilities of undersea cables, including a specific incident involving a damaged cable linking Svalbard to Norway.

More than 25,000 kilometers long, about as thick as an arm, and weighing around 70 kilograms per meter, the Asia-Africa-Europe-1 undersea cable connects 19 countries from France to Hong Kong with high-speed internet, up to 40 terabytes per second. However, traffic on the Asia-Africa-Europe-1 has come to a halt, severed somewhere in the Red Sea between Yemen and Djibouti. According to HGC, the network operator from Hong Kong, four out of about fifteen cables running from Asia to Europe are currently non-functional, affecting a quarter of the data traffic in this region.

Israeli media had reported days earlier that the cables in the Red Sea had been destroyed, speculating that the Huthi militia could be behind it. They have been attacking shipping traffic in the Red Sea for months, leading to only about half of the cargo ships taking the route through the Suez Canal, while the others prefer the safer but significantly longer route around the Cape of Good Hope, which is also more expensive. For the Huthi, this drastic disruption of global trade is a significant success, justified by their claim that ships from countries supporting the war against Gaza should not pass through their waters.

However, the Huthi do not have divers or submarines. In reality, they have randomly fired at cargo ships and tankers, even those carrying supplies for their own starving population. Nevertheless, large parts of the Arab world celebrate them as the only group genuinely supporting the Palestinians.

Disrupting important internet connections would be another major propaganda victory. Yemen's internationally recognized government warned as early as February that the Huthi might sever cables, later mentioning the imminent use of an ""undersea weapon."" Initial reports of a severed cable emerged on February 24, and at least one Israeli media outlet immediately held the Huthi responsible.

A lingering question remains: how did the Huthi reach the cables, which are likely located several hundred meters deep? Experts believe it is more plausible that the undersea cables were severed by a ship's anchor. A spokesperson for Seacom, a company operating one of the cables, stated, ""Our team finds it plausible that the cable was damaged by the dragging of an anchor, as there is a lot of shipping traffic in the region and the seabed is shallow in many areas."" However, clarification can only come from a repair ship on site. Satellite images analyzed by SZ show that the Rubymar could have been in the area where the cables were likely severed.

The Belize-flagged ship was hit by a missile from the Huthi on February 18 and has since sunk, having drifted about 70 kilometers uncrewed after the crew was evacuated. The severing of the cables is not the only damage resulting from the Huthi's missile attack, as 20,000 tons of fertilizer sank with the Rubymar.

Assessing the ecological consequences of the sunken fertilizer cargo is complicated for experts as long as the conditions on-site remain unclear. At what depth is the ship? How quickly will the fertilizer be released, and what is its exact composition? How strong is the current? If fertilizer rapidly enters the surface water in large amounts, it could lead to an algal bloom, according to chemist Hermann Bange from the Geomar Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel. The Red Sea is generally nutrient-poor, so algae at the surface would benefit from the nutrient influx and likely multiply rapidly.

Whether this has negative consequences largely depends on which species prevail, making it difficult to predict. If the fertilizer slowly sinks, it will likely disperse quickly due to currents, resulting in minimal noticeable effects. Boran Kartal, a research group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen, believes that the fertilizer will not be released suddenly, and thus, there will probably be no long-term changes to the ecosystem due to the sinking of the Rubymar.

However, the consequences of a potential bloom of harmful algae in the region are difficult to assess. ""In nutrient-rich areas like the Baltic Sea, harmful algal blooms occur regularly, but practically never in the nutrient-poor Red Sea."" Depending on the course of the bloom, fish stocks in the region could be affected, at least temporarily. The expected nutrient amounts released around the wreck are comparable to nutrient inputs in densely populated coastal areas of the Red Sea.","The article titled ""Huthi sollen Internetkabel durchtrennt haben"" discusses the cutting of the Asia-Africa-Europe-1 undersea internet cable in the Red Sea, which has led to a significant disruption in data traffic.

Is network resiliency able to reach beyond five nines and SLAs for enterprises seeking always-on services?  

Given recent headlines and discussion in the wake of undersea cable cuts in the Red Sea, the answer is still no for multinationals. The situation is best described as business interruption as usual.  

On Saturday, February 24, three different cables were reported to have suffered faults:  

These international systems connect far-apart states like South Africa, the United Kingdom, and China. The faults off the coast of Yemen need to be repaired. The work is tough to do in a narrow, heavily traveled shipping lane that doubles as a war zone with a concentration of submarine cables on the sea floor.  

Fighting in the Middle East is a concern as enterprises and the telecom industry rely on undersea cables to carry the bulk of their intercontinental traffic.  

Since late February, three more faults in the region have been reported, according to TeleGeography, a research firm that builds and maintains massive data sets that are used to monitor, forecast, and map the telecommunications industry. One report has a ship dragging an anchor as the culprit, which the firm claims is the second most frequent cause behind cuts/faults of these business and communications lifelines.  

The cause of the undersea cable disruption is still uncertain.  

Whodunnit? Since then, no open-source evidence has come out to support the claim that Houthis, part of a Yemen civil war, were responsible. ""But here's one thing we do know: accidents happen all the time,"" noted Tim Stronge, Research VP at TeleGeography, in a March 5 advisory. ""On average, two cables suffer faults somewhere in the world every week!""  

Suspicious activity or not?  

Stronge does not believe the three almost simultaneous cable faults are overly suspicious.  

“Geological features or permitting issues have occasionally forced installers to lay different cables in close proximity to each other,” he explained. Such a situation increases the danger of a multi-cable fault.  

In 2012, multiple cables suffered faults off the coast of Alexandria, Egypt. “Initial speculation blamed saboteurs, but many in the submarine cable industry now believe that a single ship dragging its anchor was the cause.”  

Is it time to panic?  

Although the Red Sea cables carry 90% of Europe-Asia communications flow through them, operators have built a lot of redundancy into the network. The ability to reroute traffic is increasingly available.  

There are fourteen cables already laid on the Red Sea. Even if three are down, eleven remain, wrote Stronge. “Data destined for damaged cables may be rerouted southward around the Cape of Good Hope or eastward through Asia and the United States.”  

Tougher times ahead for undersea cable industry  

Houthi attacks on ships make life tougher for the undersea cable industry, which could hurt enterprises.  

* Vessels that are sinking or sunken present new underwater hazards to cables and cable ships. The cables typically lie on the ocean floor.  
* Combined, these two may make the installation of new cables in the Red Sea too prohibitive and make repair risky.  

Items for governments to act on  

Governments are the ones on the hook for the long-term security of subsea cables. The International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) has created a list of 16 action items.  

ICPC membership comprises governmental administrations and commercial companies that own or operate submarine telecommunications or power cables, as well as other companies that have an interest in the submarine cable industry—including most of the world’s major cable system owners and cable ship operators.  

One priority, which is a work in progress, is changing rules and regulations to open new seabed lanes and landing zones for cables. Having physically diverse zones provides options in locating where cables come ashore.  

Flirting with disaster  

“Some government regulations (such as environmental protection) may unintentionally herd cables into narrow corridors,” explained Stronge. “As we’ve seen time and time again, a lack of physical diversity invites disaster.”  

Seeking alternatives  

When it comes to alternatives to undersea cables, the cupboard is bare. Satellite connections are not fast or large enough to carry the traffic load on submarine pipes. 5G is not mature enough to help.  

One approach is to install cables over alternative routes. As we reported in December, the SeaMeWe-6 cable project seeks to construct a cable that links Asia, the Middle East, and Europe via a route through India rather than the Red Sea. The article noted that the U.S. “snatched away” control of the project from China due to the importance of having alternative paths to send data.

The reinforcement is broken.

For the first time in public, NRK can reveal what the Svalbard cable looked like after it was damaged on the night of January 7, 2022. The tear enabled seawater to come into contact with a copper layer carrying electrical current in one of the two cables that together make up the Svalbard fiber. The current is used to amplify the fiber optic signals that flow through the 1300km long cables between the peninsula and the Norwegian mainland. Because of the breakage, the current went straight to ground, and the cable stopped working.

It has not been previously established how the cable was damaged. Now, the photos might provide some clues.

Initially, the police stated that they believed the damages were caused by human activity. Later on, the investigation was dropped due to lack of evidence.

Several experts with extensive experience with submarine cables and installations have assessed the images for NRK. Their judgment is that the damage to the Svalbard fiber was due to the cables being crushed.

Heavy trawling in the area when the cable damage occurred is noted, with significant fishing activity posing risks to the cable. The Svalbard fiber is ideally buried deep into the sediments, but if the seabed is too hard, it may lie much more shallow, potentially at risk from bottom trawl activity.

The critically important cable that connects Svalbard to the mainland is no thicker than a pinkie finger, with a steel wire reinforcement for protection. Cable damages occur many times each year globally, highlighting the vulnerability of such infrastructure in remote areas.

This incident is also one of the first well-known cases linking cable damage to potential Russian hybrid warfare at sea, illustrating the geopolitical implications of such infrastructure vulnerabilities.","The article discusses the damage to the Svalbard fiber optic cable, detailing the incident on January 7, 2022, and the potential causes of the damage, such as trawling activities.

On Monday morning, the entire island of Bornholm experienced a power outage. Questions arise: Was it sabotage like the nearby Nordstream gas pipelines? The locals suspect something different, and an investigation is expected to clarify the situation in the coming days.

Since the Nordstream leaks, Bornholm has been in the global press spotlight as a marker of the European energy crisis. The sabotaged gas pipelines Nord Stream 1 and 2 run off the coast of this Baltic island.

On Monday, it made headlines that power was completely cut off on Bornholm for several hours. The island covers 588 square kilometers, about half the size of the nearest German island, Rügen. Authorities initially reported that an underwater cable supplying electricity from Sweden was cut. ""At this time, there is no reason to speculate about the cause,"" wrote the utility provider Trefor on its website. ""We are working to determine what caused the power outage.""

This statement fueled speculation: another instance of sabotage, a possible attack – similar to what happened with the Nordstream pipelines?

The locals, however, seem eager to avoid further geopolitical entanglements. A library staff member, speaking on the phone, urged not to suggest that it was the Russians. She believes the outage is just a ""stupid coincidence,"" as power outages happen occasionally due to ship anchors colliding with the underwater cable to Sweden. ""There’s no reason to panic.""

The last major power outage happened just over six months ago, on February 26, also in the morning. That was due to a fault in the underwater cable and a high-voltage network error. The line runs along the seabed between the island's town of Hasle and southern Sweden's Borreby, connecting Bornholm's grid to that of its neighbor. In the past, technical faults and dropped ship anchors frequently interrupted the power connection to Sweden, but this went largely unnoticed until now, amid the energy crisis.

Since the railway blackout, concerns about potential blackouts in electricity supply have risen in Germany. The mysterious Nordstream pipeline leaks highlighted that underwater energy and data lines are potential targets in the hybrid war for influence and markets. ""The result is uncertainty and the weaving of conspiracy theories,"" says Professor Christian Bueger from the University of Copenhagen, who studies maritime security and underwater disruptions.

The locals were not particularly alarmed by the latest blackout, despite the internet and phone services being down. A hotelier reported receiving an SMS about the outage, stating that power would be restored in a few hours. The outage began at 7:49 AM, and according to Trefor, by 9:35 AM, about a third of the 40,000 residents were back online, with full restoration by late morning.

In the island's hospital with 900 beds, the emergency generator kicked in, and life-support machines were secured by battery operation, ensuring no danger to patients. A video on the Facebook page of the local newspaper shows traffic flowing without traffic lights, self-regulating without issues.

Kenneth Nielsen, a 38-year-old guesthouse owner, noticed the outage when he looked at the black time display on his oven. He tested the lights and speculated it might be the underwater cable or the Russians, but quickly dismissed the latter.

He couldn't serve breakfast to his six guests, but it wasn't a problem, as he explained the situation. Nielsen noted that outages happen from time to time. Despite the Danish calmness, the Nordstream leaks worried the locals: ""Everyone is talking about it: who did it, what could happen next.""

This concern is partly due to Bornholm's historical connection to Russia and the former Soviet Union, as the Soviet army occupied the island for almost a year after World War II. There are fears that the island could be drawn into the conflict, at least as part of the war rhetoric.

By Monday afternoon, the Danish network operator Energinet reported that the line between Bornholm and Sweden was functioning again, and the outage was due to a local error on the island. Trefor announced an investigation into the incident, with results expected in the coming days. Then the residents of Bornholm will know if it was just another power outage or if their island will attract much more attention in the future.","The article titled ""Stromausfall auf Bornholm: eine Ferieninsel im Fokus der Energiekrise"" discusses a power outage on the island of Bornholm, which was attributed to a cut underwater cable that supplies electricity from Sweden.

There are many, many things that can go wrong as you lay thousands of miles of fibre optic cable along the ocean's floor.  
Earthquakes can rip things up, as can fishing hooks. But now we know of a new threat: Shark attacks.  
  
According to Network World, Google Product Manager Dan Belcher told folks at a Google marketing event in Boston last week that Google ensures its cable is sheathed in a Kevlar-like protective coating to keep the sharks from chomping through the line. Turns out this is standard operating procedure among undersea cable-layers, who must take a number of steps to keep aquatic life from harming (or being harmed by) data cables.  
  
We asked Google about this, and if they have any idea why sharks would want to eat fibre optic cables, but they had nothing to say.  
  
But apparently it's a thing, as you can see in the video below.  
  
As Google expands its online empire, undersea cables are becoming an increasingly important part of the plan. The company has invested in two major undersea cables connecting the western US to Asia, and a third cable that extends Google's network within Asia. That's where the big data bottleneck is these days, and a lack of fibre connectivity can push up market prices for moving data between the two continents. That is unless, like Google, you have access to your very own cables.  
  
We've long known squirrels are a major problem to anyone laying cable, but according to a report by the International Cable Protection Committee cable bites -- by sharks and other fish -- remain a surprisingly persistent problem. In the 1980s, a deep-ocean fibre optic cable was cut four times. Researchers blame crocodile sharks for those attacks after finding teeth in the cable.  
  
The cable protection folks really have no idea why sharks bite cables either, although some suggest it may be due to ""electro magnetic fields from a suspended cable strumming in currents,"" they say in their report.  
  
Sharks, like other animals, can detect magnetic fields -- and they have miniature volt sensors in their mouths that they use to detect prey and mates. But there's a simpler explanation, says Chris Lowe, the professor who runs California State University, Long Beach's, Shark Lab. They may simply be curious. ""If you had just a piece of plastic out there shaped like a cable, there's a good chance they'd bite that too."" But even an exploratory nibble is enough to cause some serious trouble. ""Just a little bite is enough to get through the jacket, damage the fibres and then you're screwed,"" Lowe says.  
  
More recently, Level 3 Communications technicians did come across a three foot long shark in a trench near its fibre cable -- two miles inland -- in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Maybe it was looking for a bite.  
  
This article originally appeared on Wired.com.","The article titled ""Sharks wage war on undersea internet cables"" discusses the impact of sharks on undersea cables, detailing incidents where sharks bite these cables, leading to cuts and damage.

It provides historical examples, such as a deep-ocean fibre optic cable being cut multiple times due to shark bites in the 1980s, and mentions expert opinions on why sharks might be attracted to these cables, including curiosity and the detection of electromagnetic fields.

Two lines, Asia-America Gateway (AAG) and Asia Pacific Gateway (APG), are completely offline at the moment, and the Asia Africa Europe 1 (AAE-1) line is seeing disruptions towards the Hong Kong hub, while the Intra Asia (IA) line cable is seeing problems near the Singapore hub.

This is the first time such incidents have happened at the same time, and even more unfortunately, during the Lunar New Year holiday.

Many internet users have complained of slow and unreliable internet connections in recent times, ISPs have said.

Stressing that this was an unfortunate ‘force majeure’, a representative from Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group (VNPT) said the provider was actively deploying measures to ensure international internet connections to its consumers, including sharing data loads between still available international lines, working with Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube, as well as optimising traffic on different cables.

Thanks to these efforts, platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube can still be accessed normally, while financial, banking, and insurance transactions can still be conducted.

Mobile data connections are also ensured, according to the VNPT representative.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Three cables under the Red Sea that provide global internet and telecommunications have been cut as the waterway remains a target of Yemen’s Houthi rebels, officials said Monday. Meanwhile, a Houthi missile attack set a ship ablaze in the Gulf of Aden, but caused no injuries.

What cut the lines remains unclear. There has been concern about the cables being targeted in the Houthi campaign, which the rebels describe as an effort to pressure Israel to end its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The Houthis have denied attacking the lines, however.

While global shipping has already been disrupted through the Red Sea, a crucial route for cargo and energy shipments from Asia and the Middle East to Europe, the sabotage of telecommunication lines could further escalate the monthslong crisis.

The cut lines include Asia-Africa-Europe 1, the Europe India Gateway, Seacom and TGN-Gulf, Hong Kong-based HGC Global Communications said. It described the cuts as affecting 25% of the traffic flowing through the Red Sea. It described the Red Sea route as crucial for data moving from Asia to Europe and said it had begun rerouting traffic.

HGC Global Communications described the Seacom-TGN-Gulf line as being two separate cables when it is actually one at the area of the cut, according to Tim Stronge, a subsea cable expert with TeleGeography, a Washington-based telecommunications market research company.

Responding to questions from The Associated Press, Seacom said that “initial testing indicates the affected segment lies within Yemeni maritime jurisdictions in the Southern Red Sea.” It said it was rerouting the traffic that it was able to change, though some services were down.

Tata Communications, part of the Indian conglomerate and behind the Seacom-TGN-Gulf line, told AP that it “initiated immediate and appropriate remedial actions” after the line was cut.

“We invest in various cable consortiums to increase our diversity and hence in such situations of a cable cut or snag, we are able to automatically reroute our services,” Tata said.

Other firms behind those lines, which provide data to Africa, Asia and the Middle East, didn’t respond to AP’s queries.

In early February, Yemen’s internationally recognized government in exile alleged that the Houthis planned to attack the cables. The lines appeared to have been cut on Feb. 24, with the organization NetBlocks noticing internet access in the East African nation of Djibouti suffering from interruptions two days later. Seacom serves Djibouti.

But for their part, the Houthis have denied targeting the cables. The rebels blamed the disruptions on British and U.S. military operations, but didn’t offer evidence to support the allegation and have made false claims in the past.

Since November, the rebels have repeatedly targeted ships in the Red Sea and surrounding waters over the Israel-Hamas war. Those vessels have included at least one with cargo bound for Iran, the Houthis’ main benefactor, and an aid ship later bound for Houthi-controlled territory.

Despite more than a month and a half of U.S.-led airstrikes, Houthi rebels have remained capable of launching significant attacks. They include the attack last month on a cargo ship carrying fertilizer, the Rubymar, which sank on Saturday after drifting for several days, and the downing of an American drone worth tens of millions of dollars.

The Houthis insist their attacks will continue until Israel stops its combat operations in the Gaza Strip, which have enraged the wider Arab world and seen the Houthis gain international recognition.

Meanwhile, the British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center on Monday separately warned of a new attack in the Gulf of Aden. The private security firm Ambrey described the vessel targeted as a Liberia-flagged, Israel-affiliated container ship that sustained damage and issued a distress call.

“The container ship reportedly encountered two explosions of which the first occurred at a ‘distance’ off its port quarter, while the second damaged the vessel’s accommodation block and a container leading,” Ambrey said. “The explosion further led to a fire onboard and the crew’s firefighting efforts were underway.”

Ambrey and the UKMTO said no crew member on the ship had been injured in the blaze, which was extinguished several hours later.

Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesman, claimed the attack in a prerecorded statement. He identified the ship as the MSC Sky II, sailing for the Switzerland-based firm Mediterranean Shipping Co, but sought to link the vessel to Israel. The ship’s details and last-known location corresponded to details about the attack.

The Houthis “will continue to prevent Israeli navigation or those heading to the ports of occupied Palestine until the aggression is stopped and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted,” Saree said.

The U.S. military’s Central Command acknowledged the attack on the MSC Sky II and said the vessel “did not request assistance and continued on its way.” The U.S. military separately conducted airstrikes on two anti-ship cruise missiles in Yemen.

MSC didn’t respond to questions about the attack.

It remains unclear how the Houthis could attack subsea cables themselves. The rebels aren’t known to have the diving or salvage capability to target the lines, which sit hundreds of meters below the surface of the waterway.

However, subsea cables can be cut by anchors, including those dropped from some of the ships that have been disabled in attacks. A drifting ship with its anchor scraping the sea could be the culprit.

“Our team thinks it is plausible that it could have been affected by anchor dragging, due to the amount of marine traffic the region deals with and the low seabed in many parts of the Red Sea,” Seacom said. “This can only be confirmed once the repair ship is on site.”

There are 14 cables now running through the Red Sea, with another six planned, said Stronge, the subsea cable expert.

Although the risk of getting eaten by a shark is extremely small, the same cannot be said for underwater fiber-optic cables that carry data around the world. It seems sharks have a mighty hankering for these vital intercontinental communication links – a penchant which has set Google on a mission to reinforce its trans-Pacific cables by wrapping them in a Kevlar-like material. Google product manager Dan Belcher revealed their shark-proofing efforts at a marketing meeting last week in Boston.

#### An Appetite for Communication

But why are sharks zeroing in on our global communication networks? Sharks have an uncanny ability to sense electromagnetic fields in the water using tiny detectors in their snouts called ampullae of Lorenzini. The organs, which look like freckles, sense even minute changes to electrical fields in the water, helping sharks find prey, navigate... or locate fiber-optic cables. ""No doubt the electromagnetic fields associated with these wires are highly attractive to these sharks,"" George Burgess, director of the Florida Program for Shark Research, told USA Today.

Interestingly, sharks don’t seem to be lured to the older copper cables that run underwater. It’s led to speculation that sharks confuse the high-voltage, magnetic emissions from fiber-optic cables with the signals given off by fish. Updated cables will thus likely protect the sharks and reduce energy-wasting attacks.

#### Shark Snack

Sharks have been giving global communications companies headaches since the 1980s. According to the New York Times, a few shark teeth were found planted in a cable of the Canary Islands in 1985. Every year, more than 50 repairs are needed on undersea transcontinental communication lines due to damage from wildlife, fishing trawlers and earthquakes, The Guardian reports. Google’s reinforced cables will be installed as part of a new $300 million system connecting the United States to Japan, according to a press release from project partner NEC. It will result in an Internet connection that relays information across the Pacific Ocean at 60 terabytes per second. That's good news for Internet users, but maybe the sharks have an ulterior motive: Perhaps they're simply fed up with fear-mongering documentaries that cast them in a negative light.

**Author:** Bob Wallace, Featured Writer  

Is network resiliency able to reach beyond five nines and SLAs for enterprises seeking always-on services?  

Given recent headlines and discussion in the wake of undersea cable cuts in the Red Sea, the answer is still no for multinationals. The situation is best described as business interruption as usual.

On Saturday, February 24, three different cables were reported to have suffered faults:

These international systems connect far-apart states like South Africa, the United Kingdom, and China. The faults off the coast of Yemen need to be repaired. The work is tough to do in a narrow, heavily traveled shipping lane that doubles as a war zone with a concentration of submarine cables on the sea floor.

Fighting in the Middle East is a concern as enterprises and the telecom industry rely on undersea cables to carry the bulk of their intercontinental traffic.

Since late February, three more faults in the region have been reported, according to TeleGeography, a research firm that builds and maintains massive data sets that are used to monitor, forecast, and map the telecommunications industry. One report has a ship dragging an anchor as the culprit, which the firm claims is the second most frequent cause behind cuts/faults of these business and communications lifelines.

The cause of the undersea cable disruption is still uncertain. Since then, no open-source evidence has come out to support the claim that Houthis, part of a Yemen civil war, were responsible. ""But here's one thing we do know: accidents happen all the time,"" noted Tim Stronge, Research VP at TeleGeography. ""On average, two cables suffer faults somewhere in the world every week!""  

Stronge does not believe the three almost simultaneous cable faults are overly suspicious. “Geological features or permitting issues have occasionally forced installers to lay different cables in close proximity to each other,” he explained. Such a situation increases the danger of a multi-cable fault.

Although the Red Sea cables carry 90% of Europe-Asia communications flow through them, operators have built a lot of redundancy into the network. There are fourteen cables already laid on the Red Sea. Even if three are down, eleven remain. “Data destined for damaged cables may be rerouted southward around the Cape of Good Hope or eastward through Asia and the United States.”

Houthi attacks on ships make life tougher for the undersea cable industry, which could hurt enterprises. Vessels that are sinking or sunken present new underwater hazards to cables and cable ships. Combined, these two may make the installation of new cables in the Red Sea too prohibitive and make repair risky.

Governments are the ones on the hook for the long-term security of subsea cables. The International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) has created a list of 16 action items. ICPC membership comprises governmental administrations and commercial companies that own or operate submarine telecommunications or power cables, as well as other companies that have an interest in the submarine cable industry.

One priority, which is a work in progress, is changing rules and regulations to open new seabed lanes and landing zones for cables. Having physically diverse zones provides options in locating where cables come ashore.

When it comes to alternatives to undersea cables, the cupboard is bare. Satellite connections are not fast or large enough to carry the traffic load on submarine pipes. 5G is not mature enough to help.  

One approach is to install cables over alternative routes. The SeaMeWe-6 cable project seeks to construct a cable that links Asia, the Middle East, and Europe via a route through India rather than the Red Sea. The article noted that the U.S. “snatched away” control of the project from China due to the importance of having alternative paths to send data.","The article discusses multiple incidents of undersea cable cuts, specifically detailing three cables that suffered faults in the Red Sea.

It analyzes the causes of these cuts, such as ships dragging anchors, and highlights the significance of these cables for global telecommunications.

At 15:35 UTC (21:05 Mumbai, 8:35 Pacific) on February 25th, Tata Communications reported a cable cut between India and Singapore affecting nearly 350 Gbit per sec of capacity. We received a notification via one of our hosting providers in India. Even prior to the notification, we began seeing issues across a range of services where traffic was flowing to and from India. From more than 60 services that we were testing, we saw packet loss increase to over 3% in Asia and rise above 20% in India and Malaysia.

Our agents in New Delhi and Kuala Lumpur reported elevated packet loss and latency to many international services that transit Tata and Bharti Airtel, the two primary international transit providers to India and a major provider to Malaysia. For several hours this packet loss ranged from 10-30% and latency increased by 200-300ms.

### Tata’s Undersea Cable Network

Tata Communications operates the largest subsea fiber optic cable network in the world and is a Tier 1 network provider. Tata has capacity on 3 cables between India and Singapore: SEA-ME-WE 3 and 4 (which are shared with other operators) and Tata Indicom (owned solely by Tata). This cable cut appeared to affect the Tata Indicom Cable (TIC), as we saw traffic affected on the Chennai to Singapore route, with severe congestion in Singapore.

### Global Services Affected

Many services with data centers in East Asia and the western United States were affected by the Tata cable cut, given the importance of Tata as a transit provider between India and Singapore. Services that were impacted from India included Box, Docusign, Facebook, Oracle CRM, RingCentral, Salesforce, and SAP.

Instability occurred throughout Tata’s network, with POPs as far away as Chicago and San Jose registering >50% packet loss. We tracked packet loss and latency until 18:15 UTC, nearly 3 hours, before many Indian networks switched traffic to Bharti Airtel. This often caused increased latency, as traffic peered in suboptimal locations, such as London for traffic destined for Australia.","The article titled 'Tata Cable Cut Affects SaaS Services Worldwide' discusses a significant incident involving a cable cut between India and Singapore operated by Tata Communications.

**Internet Outages & Trends**  
There’s a line in the ThousandEyes Cloud Performance Report that I often return to that ponders the extent to which enterprise data is ""in the cloud or under the sea."" The answer, of course, may be both: It’s in the cloud at-rest and under the sea in-transit.

Whether in the cloud or sea, that infrastructure needs to be understood by everyone who holds responsibility for that data and how it makes its way between different components of the end-to-end service delivery chain that underpins digital experience delivery. A suboptimal understanding can translate into customer-facing problems, manifesting as either degradation or an inability to access a digital service and/or transact with it.

The growing complexity of subsea and terrestrial cable infrastructure that underpins both enterprises’ and the world’s traffic flows presents a challenge for IT teams, who are trying to understand all the interactions, relationships, and dependencies that can impact their services and applications.

Subsea cables are the backbone of international data movement today, with the Internet heavily reliant on undersea cables for high-capacity communications. A widely-cited piece of research suggests that 97% of the world’s Internet traffic is carried via subsea routes. Subsea cables increasingly also have a role to play in even domestic traffic management, with subsea routes being used in place of terrestrial fiber for intercapital or interstate routes as well.

Whether terrestrial or subsea, fiber cabling is susceptible to damage and that can lead to disruption or degraded performance on key routes. On terrestrial routes, breakages are often accidental damage caused by heavy earthmoving equipment, whose operators are unaware of cable paths prior to excavation work taking place. An equivalent hazard exists for undersea cables. At either end, the cables run through relatively shallow waters to a cable landing station, from which traffic is pushed onto terrestrial links. While the coastal zoning around landing stations tends to be protected, their nature means they may be exposed to encounters with shipping and other marine traffic. Heavy anchors, propellers, and cables do not mix. Add stormy weather into the area and accidental breakages can often occur. Even as cables run over the seabed in deeper water, there are other hazards to consider: Seismic activity and even sharks have been considered problematic in the past.

When damage does occur, locating a cut and re-splicing the fiber is considerably easier on terrestrial routes than it is for subsea. Repairing a damaged subsea cable can take some time, depending on the availability of the repair vessel, its engagement status, and its presence in the area. Additionally, time is needed to locate and fix the fault.

All that being said, submarine cables are increasingly designed with resilience, diverse paths, and multiple cable systems to ensure continued functionality. Increasing the number and diversity of cable routes can offer some mitigation. Establishing a high level of redundancy enhances resilience and helps to ensure that any damage is unlikely to have a significant impact on a user's digital experience.

Both geostationary and low earth orbit (LEO) satellites can also provide additional options to ensure business continuity, helping to supplement and fill gaps. Although they cannot entirely compensate for widespread cable loss, they can at least guarantee that crucial messages are transmitted and provide a feasible option for aligning application characteristics with infrastructure constraints, thereby reducing the load on subsea infrastructure.

The vastness of today’s subsea cable ecosystem drives home the importance of understanding your end-to-end service delivery chain, and the routes that traffic takes or may take as part of your digital experience delivery.

In our Cloud Performance Report, ThousandEyes analyzed network performance data to help organizations determine the optimal cloud ecosystems and zones/regions for their needs, based on ingress/egress points, how traffic reached those points (sometimes via subsea routes), and whether those routes were operationally acceptable.

But more than that, with so much traffic—domestic and international—traversing subsea paths, it’s critical to understand how and where those cables are landed, and what onward paths exist for that traffic, in order to really drive optimization and improvement in digital experience delivery. Careful attention and visibility here may reduce the risk of experiencing a reduction in capacity due to accidental cable breakage. It may also provide an evidentiary basis to align with providers that have prioritized capacity between the cable landing station and their nearest point-of-presence—upgrade work that has been occurring in Virginia recently.

On August 29, AWS experienced a global issue between 8:32 AM and 9:58 AM (UTC) that impacted access to multiple cloud services. The problems manifested as an inability to contact AWS service endpoints in us-east-1 from seven other regions, among them us-gov-west-1. “Customers may also have received error messages when contacting the global STS (Security Token Service) endpoint from the affected regions,” AWS said.

The problems manifested as accessibility issues, and the company initially suspected a problem with its identity and access management service. However, upon their investigation, AWS engineers found the root cause to be an unspecified “networking issue,” which they remediated, allowing accessibility to recover.

In my experience, misidentifying the root cause of a degradation or outage happens fairly often, even more so when customers are unable to authenticate to or access services. Users, and even engineers, can too quickly draw their own conclusions about the root cause. However, as we have observed, some outages are not what they seem, and having independent visibility of every component of the service delivery chain can help teams accurately identify the root cause, and recognize “false flags” for what they are.

On August 26, ServiceNow experienced an outage that affected some customers, preventing them from accessing their ServiceNow instances. The outage was first observed around 7:25 PM (UTC) and initially appeared to be originating from ServiceNow’s environment, with an increase in network connection and server timeouts observed across ServiceNow servers.

During the incident, the ServiceNow network experienced a higher than normal loss rate across multiple ISPs. This suggests an increase in network traffic that was overwhelming the network circuits—a classic sign of a potential DDoS attack. ServiceNow later confirmed that DDoS activity caused a surge in network traffic that saturated externally-facing network circuits in their Arizona and Ontario data centers.","The article discusses subsea cables, their susceptibility to damage, and the implications of such damage on internet connectivity.

"Impact of Shark Bites on Undersea Internet Cables","Repair costs exceeding $250,000 per incident; historical incidents since 1985 highlight the unusual threat of sharks attracted to electromagnetic signals.","https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/11034921/How-a-sharks-bite-can-bring-down-the-internet.html","","By Matthew Sparkes 15 August 2014 • 7:30am",Yes,"Matthew Sparkes","London, United Kingdom","500000","2014-08-15","English","The Telegraph","Google has had to reinforce its fragile undersea internet cables with a material similar to that used in bulletproof vests in order to protect against shark attacks.

The company announced at its Google Cloud Roadshow event last week that it was going back to some of the 100,000 miles of private fibre optic cable that it owns around the world and reinforcing it with the protective material. At least part of the reason is to minimise the damage that results from frequent and unexplainable shark attacks, said product manager Dan Belcher.

Fibre optic cables use lasers to send data across the ocean, allowing transfer rates up to 100 times higher than traditional copper cables. But they are made of fragile glass strands so need to be protected from any knocks or sharp movements. At the event Google said that it was now using a “Kevlar-like material” in order to do this.

For unknown reasons sharks seem drawn to the data cables that rest on the ocean floor. One attack has even been caught on camera, as you can see in the video clip below.

The issue dates back to at least 1985, when shark teeth were found buried deep in the coating of an experimental fiber optic line off the Canary Islands.

The New York Times reported in 1987 that sharks had shown an “inexplicable taste” for the then-new technology, causing at least four failures on the cables linking the US, Europe and Japan.

“The attacks have caused some delays in laying cable, and a single bite on a deep-sea line, which is about the size of a garden hose, can cost $250,000 or more to fix. There is a benefit, however. In studying ways to limit damage from the attacks, the telephone companies are providing marine scientists with valuable new data on sharks and specimens of previously unknown species,” reported the paper.

The reason for sharks biting cables is unknown. In the 1987 story a spokesman for AT&T describes catching sharks and seeing if they would eat segments of cable: ''They got this one big shark on deck and tried to force-feed him samples of cable to see how he'd react. He was not happy about having someone try to shove it down his mouth.''

This has led some to suggest that it is actually the data that they are attracted to, or at least the electromagnetic signals it gives off, which could appear similar to those given off by fish and other creatures which sharks feed on. Sharks have been shown to detect electromagnetic signals given off by prey.

Earlier this week it was announced that Google was working with Asian telecoms companies to build and operate a new trans-Pacific cable network connecting the United States to Japan.

The consortium of companies – which also includes China Mobile International, China Telecom Global, Global Transit, KDDI and SingTel – will invest approximately $300 million (£179m) in the system, known as 'Faster'. The aim is to address the intense traffic demands for broadband, mobile, applications, content and enterprise data exchange on the trans-Pacific route.

It will have an initial capacity of 60 terabits per second and will connect Los Angeles, Portland, San Francisco, Oregon and Seattle to Chikura and Shima in Japan.","The article discusses the impact of shark bites on undersea internet cables, providing specific examples of incidents where sharks have damaged these cables.

It details the financial costs associated with repairs, which can exceed $250,000 for a single bite, and references historical incidents dating back to 1985.

Moreover, it explains the unusual nature of the problem, suggesting that sharks may be attracted to the electromagnetic signals emitted by the cables.

This indicates a significant impact on internet connectivity and communication.

Overall, the article is centered around the topic of cut sea cables, specifically through the lens of shark attacks, which aligns with the criterion."

American military and intelligence officials have expressed concerns that Russia could damage these cables in the event of conflict or increased tensions with the West.

If Russia compromises the integrity of fiber optic cables in any of the most inaccessible locations, it would lead to interruptions in internet communications that governments, businesses, and ordinary citizens depend on. While there have been no such incidents yet, the Pentagon is worried about the increasing activity of Russian naval forces.

In September, the ship ""Yantar,"" which Russia describes as an oceanographic research vessel but which the Pentagon suspects of conducting intelligence operations, was observed along the eastern coast of the United States heading toward Cuba. According to sources, the ship and its two autonomous deep-sea vehicles could have damaged an important fiber optic cable near the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay.

As noted by a specialist in international relations in cyberspace, cables are damaged quite often. This can occur due to ship anchors or underwater catastrophes. However, this typically happens close to shore, and repairs can be made within a few days.

The Pentagon is concerned that Russia is apparently looking for vulnerable spots in cables at great depths, where damage would be difficult to detect and repair. Additionally, sources say that Russia may be searching for secret cables used for military communications.

Currently, cables transmit data that facilitate the functioning of businesses with a total capitalization of $10 trillion a day. Any serious damage would interrupt capital flows.

Britain, responding to rising tensions in the Middle East, has sent its destroyer HMS Diamond to the Persian Gulf. Additionally, starting in December, a British-led naval squadron will patrol the waters of the English Channel, North Sea, and Baltic Sea to protect undersea cables.

Defense Minister Grant Shapps announced that HMS Diamond will join the frigate HMS Lancaster and three minehunters already in the region. He emphasized the importance of increasing Britain's presence to protect its interests in an increasingly unstable world.

The deployment is intended as a signal to Iran and its allies, with the Houthis in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon becoming more active amid the conflict in Gaza.

The British defense ministry stated that HMS Diamond would help ensure freedom of navigation and maritime trade, particularly through critical routes like the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait and the Strait of Hormuz, where significant commercial shipping occurs.

The squadron tasked with safeguarding undersea communications will consist of seven ships, operating under the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF), which includes nearly all Northern European nations. This operation is described as a historic event by Shapps, amid concerns over Russian reconnaissance vessels near critical infrastructure.

The latest report from [Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/q1-2024-internet-disruption-summary) on internet disruptions pins damage to submarine cables as the leading cause of internet outages in the first quarter of 2024.

### Restrictions, disruptions, and unrest

The most significant deliberate disruption of internet traffic was caused by Houthi rebels operating in the Red Sea, who have cut three cables in the region alongside disrupting international shipping in a campaign of missile and drone strikes against traffic navigating the Suez canal. The Europe India Gateway, Seacom/Tata, and Asia Africa Europe-1 cables all had signs of intentional damage most likely done using a ship's anchor, the report states.

Cables surrounding the African coastline have been particularly vulnerable to underwater rockfalls, with the West African Cable System, Submarine Atlantic 3/West Africa Submarine Cable, African Coast to Europe and MainOne all receiving damage in this manner.

Elections, periods of civil unrest, or a combination of the two also contributed to outages in some regions of the world, usually done to suppress protests and control the flow of information, with Chad, Pakistan and Senegal all showing fluctuations and outages in regular traffic.

War is obviously another contributing factor for regions experiencing internet outages, with Ukraine, Sudan and Palestine all suffering impacts to their connectivity, with Ukraine's disruptions being largely caused by Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukrainian energy production infrastructure.

April 21, 2024  

Bangladeshi internet users are experiencing disruptions after the country's second submarine cable, SEA-ME-WE 5, the largest supplier of international bandwidth to Bangladesh, broke Friday night.

“The issue was identified at midnight. It will take at least two to three days to resume the connection,” Mirza Kamal Ahmed, managing director of Bangladesh Submarine Cables PLC (BSCPLC), told The Daily Star.

International bandwidth usage in Bangladesh now stands at around 5,200Gbps (Gigabits per second). More than half of it — about 2,700 Gbps — comes through international terrestrial cable (ITC) licence holders that import bandwidth from India across land borders.

The South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 5 (SEA-ME-WE 5) submarine cable installed in Kuakata supplies 1,700Gbps.

The undersea cable of the SEA-ME-WE 5 got broken in a spot between Singapore and Malaysia, the official said.

For that, all circuits of all members of the consortium got down, he added.

“So, a ship will be mobilised to repair and restore the service. The total operation will take minimum of two to three days,” he added.

The SEA-ME-WE 5 is a 20,000km submarine cable system connecting 17 countries through Points-of-Presence from Singapore to the Middle East to France and Italy in Western Europe.

The cable that lay on the eastern side that connected Singapore got broken, while the connectivity on the western side that connected France remained operational, he added.

For that, of the 1,700Gbps of bandwidth that comes through the system, only 100Gbps bandwidth will be supplied to Bangladesh.

The BSCPLC is now exploring ways to restore the circuits of SEA-ME-WE 5 with SEA-ME-WE 4, the country's first submarine cable installed in Cox's Bazar.

Nearly 800Gbps bandwidth is provided by the first undersea cable with which Bangladesh was connected in 2006. It currently supplies about 850Gbps bandwidth and its capacity has recently been upgraded to 3,800Gbps.

The BSCPLC is set to receive 13,200Gbps from a [third undersea cable](https://subtelforum.com/3-more-private-submarine-cables-for-bangladesh/) SEA-ME-WE 6, by 2025.

New telecom applications, combined with globalization, free trade, and deregulation in 1999-2000, led to a dramatic increase in submarine bandwidth demand. However, recent turbulence in the capital markets and weak telecom pricing have resulted in overcapacity in long-haul links.

George Krebs, VP of business strategy and sales for Alcatel Submarine Networks, mentions a trend to initially under-equip a DWDM link and upgrade it later as needed. Upgrades account for about 30% of the company's revenue, increasing the importance of termination equipment compared to wet plant.

In February, Alcatel secured a EUR45m contract from the SEA-ME-WE 3 consortium for upgrades on segments of a 40,000km network linking 92 carriers across 33 countries.

The aging CANTAT-3 cable, which connects Iceland to Canada and Europe, faced reliability issues, having 12 faults from 1994 to 2000, limiting its active time to 90%. During the latest break, satellite links maintained communications, though at a higher cost and reduced quality.

To mitigate such failures, submarine cables are being buried deeper below the seabed, though this process is slow and costly. Alcatel has built new ships to enhance cable laying capabilities in adverse conditions.

Projects like the FarIce cable, connecting Iceland to Scotland, and the 7000km Med Nautilus link from Italy to Israel, are underway, with Alcatel involved in manufacturing and negotiations.

Despite challenges, the market for repeaterless submarine links is stabilizing, with new routes and upgrades being planned, including the SEA-ME-WE 4 cable.

The SAT-3/WASC link around Africa's coast is operational, connecting 15 countries and enabling new broadband applications. France Telecom is a major investor in this project, enhancing connectivity between Europe, Africa, and Asia.

The excess capacity in the undersea cable industry is temporary, expected to resolve with the arrival of new bandwidth-hungry applications, although bankruptcies and consolidation may occur in the meantime.","The article '20,000km under the sea' discusses the severing of submarine cables, particularly the CANTAT-3 cable, which has faced multiple faults and outages.

The cable resumed stable operations on November 22, 2023.

The AAE-1 cable is one of five major undersea cables that account for a significant portion of Vietnam's international internet connectivity, enhancing quality connections to Europe and the Middle East, while also providing additional capacity to connections towards Hong Kong (China) and Singapore.

The incident on September 27 caused a loss of capacity on the cable connecting to Singapore.

On November 6, 2023, international partners also completed repairs on the Asia America Gateway (AAG) cable near the Vung Tau landing station in Vietnam.

The AAG cable, operational since November 2009, spans over 20,000 km and connects Southeast Asia directly to the U.S., passing through Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam (with a 314 km branch into Vietnam), Brunei, Hong Kong (China), the Philippines, and the U.S.

Currently, all five undersea cables utilized by Vietnamese telecom providers, namely AAG, APG, AAE-1, SMW3, and IA (Inter-Asia), are functioning normally.

Previously, at the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023, all five cables faced disruptions, creating significant challenges for telecom companies in maintaining quality international internet services. The Ministry of Information and Communications directed telecom companies to address these issues in Q2 2023.

Experts estimate that the total international internet capacity from Vietnam via these five cables is approximately 18 Tbps, with a utilization rate of around 65%. When one cable faces an issue, utilization can rise to 90%, maintaining service quality. However, if two cables encounter problems simultaneously, utilization exceeds 100%, impacting service quality.

To mitigate these issues, various solutions have been implemented, including contracts for capacity swapping among telecom companies.

When all capacity on two cables is lost simultaneously, telecom providers have supplemented and maximized capacity on land cables and other remaining cables to meet international internet connectivity demands.

During the recent Vietnam Internet Day 2023 event, Deputy Minister of Information and Communications Pham Duc Long emphasized the significant development of Vietnam's internet, which has provided numerous opportunities for the country's economic growth. However, he also noted that Vietnam's internet infrastructure is still limited compared to the scale of internet users and the population. This is evidenced by the fact that Vietnamese telecom companies are currently utilizing only five undersea cables.

Deputy Minister Pham Duc Long also mentioned that the Ministry of Information and Communications is developing and will soon issue a strategy/plan for the development of Vietnam's international fiber optic cables, aiming to ensure the safe and sustainable growth of Vietnam's digital infrastructure.

Previously, at the end of September 2023, a representative from the Telecommunications Department (Ministry of Information and Communications) announced that by the end of 2026, the undersea cable system connecting Vietnam to the international internet would be supplemented with three new cables: ADC, SJC2, and ALC, with investments from domestic telecom companies.

The goal is to have at least six additional undersea cables invested by Vietnamese telecom companies by 2030, with approximately three cables led by Vietnamese telecom providers.","The article discusses the repair of five important undersea cables for Vietnam's internet connectivity, specifically mentioning incidents that caused disruptions.

On August 6, 2023, an underwater landslide occurred in the Congo Valley at the mouth of the Congo River between Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, destroying two of the most important cables providing internet service to Africa. This incident caused internet outages along the western coast of the continent.

This is not the first technological disaster of its kind; similar incidents have occurred in the Arab world, where internet service sometimes slows down or is interrupted, often due to undersea cable breaks or temporary rerouting of internet traffic.

Despite our reliance on Wi-Fi, 99% of global internet traffic is still transmitted via undersea cables. These cables are crucial not only for personal communication but also for the economies of entire nations that depend on daily interactions with incoming and outgoing commercial ships and aircraft.

For example, approximately $9-10 billion in salaries are transferred globally through these cables, which serve as the backbone of the modern global economy.

**The Historical Context of Undersea Cables**  

The year 1839 marked a significant milestone in communication history with the invention of the electric telegraph by British inventors. This innovation revolutionized long-distance communication.

As industries grew post-Industrial Revolution, the need for messaging across countries emerged, leading to the first successful undersea telegraph cable laid in 1851 under the English Channel.

Despite facing numerous interruptions from storms and natural erosion, engineering reports helped improve the quality of communication lines.

**The Shift to Fiber Optics**  

Today, undersea cables are laid using specialized ships, with added safety measures. The first cables were simple copper wires insulated with materials derived from tropical trees. In the 1980s, fiber optic cables emerged, capable of transmitting data at much higher speeds and volumes.

Unlike traditional cables, fiber optics are less susceptible to electrical interference, enabling clearer signals over long distances.

**Modern Challenges and Future Prospects**  

The global network of undersea cables now spans approximately 1.4 million kilometers, with new projects like the 2Africa cable aiming to enhance connectivity across Africa.

However, these cables face threats from natural disasters, human activity, and geopolitical tensions, raising concerns about their security and reliability.

The future may see a shift to satellite internet, but for now, undersea cables remain the most efficient means of handling vast amounts of data globally.","The article discusses a specific incident involving the destruction of undersea cables due to an underwater landslide, which caused significant internet disruptions in Africa.

Russia has put increasing emphasis on building up a dedicated military unit, which deploys a formidable fleet of surface ships, submarines and naval drones, according to one of the officials. The unit, the “General Staff Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research,” is known by its Russian acronym GUGI.

“We are concerned about heightened Russian naval activity worldwide and that Russia’s decision calculus for damaging US and allied undersea critical infrastructure may be changing,” a US official told CNN. “Russia is continuing to develop naval capabilities for undersea sabotage mainly thru GUGI, a closely guarded unit that operates surface vessels, submarines and naval drones.”

The US regularly tracks Russian ships that patrol close to critical maritime infrastructure and undersea cables often far from Russian shores, the official said. US concern about the secretive Russian unit’s undersea operations has not been previously reported. CNN has requested comment from the Russian Ministry of Defense.

Undersea cables form a critical backbone of internet and telecommunications traffic around the world. Most communications and internet traffic travels across a vast network of high-speed fiber-optic cables installed along the ocean floor. A coordinated attack could significantly disrupt private, government and military communications along such cables as well as industries that rely on such communications, including financial markets and energy suppliers.

Undersea cables also carry vast amounts of electricity among several European countries.

The US and its allies closely monitor Russian naval activity over key undersea cables around the world. Commanders aboard a NATO patrol vessel in April 2023 told CNN they had witnessed an increase of such activity over undersea cables in the Baltic Sea in recent years.

The seas around Northern Europe are a focus of such Russian military surveillance and activity. Last year, a joint investigation by the public broadcasters of Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland found that Russia has a fleet of suspected spy ships operating in northern European waters for potential sabotage of both undersea cables and wind farms.

Using data analysis, intercepted radio communications and intelligence sources, the broadcasters tracked over several years some fifty ships operating in the area, using underwater surveillance to map sites for potential attacks.

Taiwanese and US forces have seen similar activity by the Chinese Navy in waters around Taiwan. “The activity looks like targeted harassment by Beijing – or an exercise in preparation for cutting off the whole of Taiwan,” Elisabeth Braw wrote in Foreign Policy magazine in February 2023.

Russia’s threatening activity has not been disrupted by its ongoing war against Ukraine. The Russian leadership places great value on GUGI, a US official told CNN, continuing to fund the unit even while waging war in Ukraine.

A US official told CNN the US would consider any such sabotage of undersea infrastructure as a significant escalation in Russian aggression outside of Ukraine.

“Any activities that damaged seabed infrastructure including undersea cables especially during periods of heightened tensions risks misunderstandings and misperceptions that could lead to unintended escalation,” the US official told CNN. “The US would be especially concerned about damage to our or our allies’ critical undersea infrastructure.","The article discusses the increasing risk of Russian sabotage of key undersea cables, detailing the activities of a Russian military unit involved in potential sabotage operations.

Russian submarines are capable of blocking intercontinental undersea telecommunications cables linking the US and Europe, creating a strategic vulnerability for the West, as reported by Forbes.

According to the publication, Russia ""does not rely heavily on cables"" but ""has a significant fleet of reconnaissance submarines designed to work with them.""

The Forbes article states that Russian actions to block undersea cables could paralyze the growing international digital economy. ""About 99 percent of our transoceanic data traffic goes through undersea cables, including financial transactions, emails, social media, and, of course, military communications,"" the American publication describes.

Forbes notes that the first sign the West might have of a Russian operation against the cables would be the arrival of a heavy missile submarine of project 941 ""Shark,"" which ""can be very stealthy"" and ""will surround the target area to protect the perimeter from surveillance by NATO submarines.""

""To reach the cable on the seabed, the Russians have unique deep-sea atomic stations (AGS),"" the publication continues, noting that a special carrier submarine is used for their deployment. Forbes points out that such upgraded submarines receive missile armament, which means they may no longer need to be covered by other submarines.

Forbes reminds that one of the AGS was the autonomous station AS-31 ""Losharik"" of project 10831, which burned in July 2019. The most modern carrier of such AGS is the submarine BS-64 ""Podmoskovie"" of project 09787.

""Internet cables are snagged by ship anchors quite regularly, but this usually happens in shallow water, where repairs are completed relatively quickly. Using deep-sea spy submarines, Russia can operate at depths of at least 900 meters,"" the publication notes.

Forbes acknowledges that ""there is no strong evidence in the public domain that Russia is currently conducting any operations against Western undersea cables. However, it cannot be denied that Russia continues to invest significant resources in the ability to do so.""

In July 2019, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu set the task of restoring the deep-sea apparatus AS-31 ""Losharik"" as quickly as possible after the accident in which 14 sailors died earlier that month.

At that time, the US Naval Institute stated that AGS AS-31 ""Losharik"" was intended for deployment in the North Atlantic, particularly for operations along a conditional line connecting Greenland and the British Isles (the Faroe-Icelandic border), where the American hydroacoustic anti-submarine surveillance system SOund SUrveillance System (SOSUS) is located.","The article discusses the capabilities of Russian submarines to potentially block undersea telecommunications cables connecting the US and Europe.

It highlights that such actions could paralyze the international digital economy, noting that 99% of transoceanic data traffic relies on these cables.

The article provides technical details about how these disruptions could occur and acknowledges Russia's ongoing investment in capabilities to disrupt these cables.

Therefore, it clearly focuses on the topic of cut sea cables and their strategic implications."
"Impact of Subsea Cable Breaks on Microsoft Services in South Africa","Disruptions to Microsoft cloud services affecting local businesses due to four submarine cables snapping, highlighting the critical role of subsea infrastructure in internet connectivity.","https://techcentral.co.za/microsoft-services-sa-subsea-cables-broke/241913","","Sandra Laurence",Yes,"Sandra Laurence","Linden, Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa","849750","2024-03-26","English","TechCentral","**The recent subsea** cable breaks between South Africa and Europe appeared to have an outsized impact on Microsoft cloud services in South Africa. But more was at play.

On Thursday, 14 March, four submarine cables – Wacs, Ace, Sat-3 and MainOne – snapped under the ocean off Ivory Coast, impacting internet services across the region. In South Africa, Microsoft struggled to keep its platforms available, with many assuming the two events were directly related.

Office workers across South Africa were left without access to their e-mail, to the Teams video conferencing app and other Microsoft services. Services were fully restored by the weekend of Saturday, 16 March.

Some of the largest banks’ websites were inaccessible for a few hours, while telecommunications operators, including Vodacom, also struggled.

Microsoft said the cable breaks reduced the total capacity supporting its Azure data centre regions in South Africa, namely South Africa North and South Africa West. These refer to Microsoft’s two data centre regions in South Africa, one of which is located in Gauteng, and the other in the Western Cape.

But why would an undersea cable outage thousands of kilometres away affect local data centre services – after all, isn’t half the point of having these facilities located in-country to avoid these types of interruptions? Also, Microsoft’s most direct rival, Amazon Web Services, which operates data centres in Cape Town, appeared to be less impacted. (AWS declined to comment for this story.)

Asked for comment, Microsoft didn’t directly address the issue, saying in an e-mail to TechCentral: “We’ve fixed the service interruption that some customers may have experienced caused by damage to key subsea cable systems which manage traffic in and out of the Africa region. We’ve worked with local partner carriers to implement capacity on new, diverse systems within the region. We also reconfigured some existing infrastructure to get back to pre-impact levels of capacity and remediate impact.”

Jon Tullett, IT services research manager for IDC sub-Saharan Africa, explained that, in fact, there were two related issues playing themselves out simultaneously, impacting access to Microsoft services.

### Office 365 outage

“One was the multiple cable outages affecting African internet connectivity, which included access to offshore cloud services. And Microsoft had an Office 365 outage affecting customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa on specific products,” he said.

“It’s also worth remembering is that this isn’t without precedent. This wasn’t the first Office 365 network-related outage, and not even the first this year.”

On the cable breaks, Tullett said AWS and other cloud providers weren’t affected in the same way, but for many users in Africa, cloud services were unreachable, “regardless of the service provider.”

### Read: [How African ISPs routed around broken subsea cables](https://techcentral.co.za/african-isps-broken-subsea-cables/241668/)

Tullett said Microsoft 365 (previously Office 365) was probably hit hard because “it is a massive and complex productivity software stack, spread across the world; it’s a different beast from solutions which can be fully geographically isolated, whether those are from a competitor or Microsoft itself. It’s not like the entire Azure stack fell over. Some of that difference is implicit, but some is also design and provisioning choices made by Microsoft.”

Jon Tullett

“In-country Azure IaaS (infrastructure as a service) and in-country AWS IaaS are comparable, and neither was unaffected, for instance. But offshore IaaS was affected, so if you have workloads in South Africa which depended on remote resources – even though they may seem minor – it could have a domino effect.”

Tullett said he spoke to an African financial services provider after the cables incident who had a core software stack fail because a single component dependency was located in an offshore cloud and inaccessible. This caused on-premise software components to fail.

“That highlights several cloud risks, and that’s a big topic in itself. But resilience and continuity need constant testing for curveball outages, and complex hybrid cloud infrastructure is harder to test by definition. That’s true whether you’re an end-user customer or a hyperscale software-as-a-service provider.”","The article titled ""What felled Microsoft services in SA when subsea cables broke"" discusses the impact of subsea cable breaks on Microsoft services in South Africa.

It mentions specific incidents involving four submarine cables that snapped off the coast of Ivory Coast, significantly affecting internet services in the region.

The article details how these breaks impaired Microsoft’s cloud services, leading to disruptions for users and local businesses.

Additionally, it provides context on the importance of these cables for internet connectivity and the implications of their failure.

The IA (Inter-Asia) cable is the most recently affected, with issues occurring early this morning.

The other two cables facing problems are APG (Asia-Pacific) and AAE-1 (Asia-Africa-Europe).

Having 3 out of 5 undersea cables malfunctioning has severely impacted internet connectivity for users in Vietnam, making it difficult for them to access websites and services hosted abroad.

However, the issues with these cables do not affect websites and services hosted within Vietnam.

After the incidents with the undersea cables, Vietnamese telecom companies have implemented various measures to redistribute traffic among the available international cables, opened additional access channels, and utilized terrestrial cables to ensure user connectivity.

It remains unclear when repairs will be completed and when normal service will resume.

There are 5 undersea cables connecting Vietnam internationally, including AAG (Asia-America), APG (Asia-Pacific), SMW-3 (Southeast Asia-Middle East-West Europe), IA (Inter-Asia), and AAE-1 (Asia-Africa-Europe). Additionally, there is a smaller cable, TVH, which is only 3,367 km long and connects Thailand, Vietnam, and Hong Kong (China).

Besides the undersea cables, there are also some terrestrial cables connecting Vietnam to international networks, but the majority of internet traffic in Vietnam is transmitted through undersea cables.

In fact, disruptions to the undersea cables connecting Vietnam to international networks have become quite common, occurring at least a few times each year, causing significant difficulties and inconveniences for internet users in the country.

The peak incident occurred at the end of February last year when all 5 undersea cables connecting Vietnam to international networks experienced simultaneous failures, severely affecting the quality of internet service in Vietnam.

The causes of undersea cable failures are varied, mainly due to cables being located in areas with many ships anchoring or boats forgetting to pull up their anchors while moving. As a result, these anchors can accidentally snag the cables, causing breaks.

Sometimes, cable issues are related to power supply or maintenance operations, which can also affect the transmission capacity of the cables. However, these types of issues are usually resolved more quickly and easily.

Vietnamese telecom providers are seeking solutions to shift traffic to terrestrial cables to avoid being affected by undersea cable breaks. However, in reality, global internet traffic and intercontinental connections still largely depend on undersea cables.","The article titled ""3/5 tuyến cáp quang gặp sự cố, internet Việt Nam đi quốc tế bị ảnh hưởng"" discusses significant issues related to undersea cables connecting Vietnam to international internet services.

The article elaborates on the impact of these disruptions on internet connectivity for users in Vietnam and discusses potential causes for these incidents, such as ships anchoring and damaging the cables.

Additionally, it notes that such disruptions have become a recurring issue, occurring nearly every year.

"Disagreement Over Undersea Cable Cuts: Accident or Sabotage?","Examines the cutting of BCS East-West and C-Lion1 cables; features conflicting views from US and European officials on the nature of the incidents.","https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/20/world/accident-or-sabotage-undersea-cables-intl/index.html","2024-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","Ivana Kottasová",Yes,"Ivana Kottasová","New York, NY, USA","1000000","2024-11-20","English","CNN","CNN —

Investigators are trying to crack the mystery of how two undersea internet cables in the Baltic Sea were cut within hours of each other, with European officials saying they believe the disruption was an act of sabotage and US officials suggesting it was likely an accident.

The two cables – the BCS East-West connecting Lithuania and Sweden and the C-Lion1 linking Finland with Germany – were suddenly disrupted on Sunday and Monday.

European leaders were quick to voice their suspicions. Germany’s Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said that “nobody believes that these cables were accidentally severed.”

The foreign ministers of Finland and Germany said in a joint statement that they were “deeply concerned” about the incident and raised the possibility that it was part of a “hybrid warfare,” specifically mentioning Russia in their statement.

Their assessment was not plucked out of thin air. Russia has been accused of waging a hybrid war against Europe after a string of suspicious incidents, arson attacks, explosions and other acts of sabotage across multiple European countries were traced back to Moscow.

And the disruption to the cables came just weeks after the US warned that Moscow was likely to target critical undersea infrastructure. This followed months of suspicious movements of Russian vessels in European waters and the significant beefing up of a dedicated Russian secretive marine unit tasked with surveying the seabed.

But two US officials familiar with the initial assessment of the incident told CNN on Tuesday the damage was not believed to be deliberate activity by Russia or any other nation.

Instead, the two officials told CNN they believed it likely caused by an anchor drag from a passing vessel. Such accidents have happened in the past, although not in a quick succession like the two on Sunday and Monday.

The Kremlin on Wednesday rejected the “laughable” suggestions that it was involved, saying it was “absurd to keep blaming Russia for anything without any grounds.”

Still, law enforcement agencies in both Sweden and Finland indicated they believe the damage deliberate.

The Swedish Prosecuting Administration said Tuesday it launched a preliminary investigation into a suspected sabotage. Then on Wednesday, the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation announced it was opening a criminal investigation into the suspected crimes of aggravated criminal mischief and aggravated interference with communications.

One vessel in particular has sparked the interest of authorities and online sleuths.

Vessel tracking data from Kpler shows the Chinese-flagged ship Yi Peng 3 crossed both cables at around the time each was cut. The BCS East-West was cut around 10 a.m. local time on Sunday, according to the Lithuanian Armed Forces, and the C-Lion 1 was cut around 4 a.m. local time on Monday, per Finnish telecom provider Cinia.

The bulk carrier was sailing from a Russian port, where it docked for several days.

On Wednesday, the Danish Armed Forces said they were present in the area near Yi Peng 3, but did not say whether they pursued the vessel.

A US official and a Western intelligence official both named the Yi Peng 3 as the likely ship involved in the incident. However, sources said, the US has not yet found any ties between this ship and states or entities that would order such activity.

Such accidents have happened in the past, although not in a quick succession like the two on Sunday and Monday.

On Wednesday, Cinia updated the location it believed the cut occurred at – 50 miles farther west than initially thought – which matched the track of the Yi Peng 3. Roughly six hours after the second cable was cut, the Chinese vessel stopped for roughly half an hour before continuing on.

The vessel is currently anchored in international waters in the Kattegat, about 30 miles off the coast of Denmark and Sweden.

The Yi Peng 3 had been sailing out of the Baltic Sea after a stop in the port of Vistino, Russia. Ship tracking data shows that it crossed other undersea infrastructure in the Baltic, including four gas and oil pipelines, a power line and another telecommunications cable under construction.

Asked about the vessel during a press briefing on Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said he was “not aware of the situation.”

He said China “has always fully fulfilled its flag state obligations and requires Chinese ships to strictly abide by relevant laws and regulations.”

“We also attach great importance to protecting the safety of undersea infrastructure and work with the international community to actively promote the construction and protection of submarine cables and other global information infrastructure,” he said.

According to Dimitris Ampatzidis, an analyst at Kpler, the Yi Peng 3 is linked to Win Enterprise Ship Management and registered as owned by Ningbo YiPeng Shipping Co Ltd.

“As of November 20, 2024, neither the vessel nor these entities appear on published sanction lists. However, historical trade data shows the ship has transported Russian thermal coal and coal from Murmansk and Nakhodka on at least seven occasions,” Ampatzidis said.

CNN has reached out to both companies for comment.

Cable providers are maximizing fiber optic network capacity, reach, and value for increasingly advanced intercontinental communications. An extensive network of fiber optic cables lies deep under the seas across the Earth, allowing us to quickly send emails, videos, and connect our browsers and phone calls globally. Submarine data cables date back to 1850, with the first international telegraph cable spanning the channel between England and France. By 1901, telegraph cables connected all continents except Antarctica.

The underwater cable network is critical to global commerce, handling over 95% of IP voice and data traffic and 100% of international internet traffic.

A typical submarine cable has a diameter of 17 mm to 70 mm, depending on depth, and is encased in layers of steel armor and insulation. The longest submarine cable is the SEA-ME-WE 3 system, stretching 39,000 kilometers. 

Challenges include vulnerability to disruptions, particularly from shipping and fishing activities, which cause approximately 70% of cable damage. Significant incidents include the disruption of internet service in December 2008 due to the cutting of three major cables, and a suspected deliberate cut in March 2013.

Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, also threaten undersea fiber, with past events causing major communication outages. Recent efforts include the Southeast Asia-Japan Cable (SJC) deployment to enhance reliability against such threats. 

Overall, submarine cables remain the preferred method for data transmission due to their reliability, security, and lower latency compared to satellite communications.","The article discusses various aspects of submarine optical cables and includes specific incidents of cable cuts, such as the significant disruption caused by the cutting of three major cables in December 2008 and a suspected deliberate cut in March 2013.

The Internet infrastructure that powers the Internet is increasingly becoming a battleground between the United States and China. As technological advancements and global connectivity through the internet continue to reshape the world, the control and security of essential communication arteries has become vital for both economic and political dominance. The two countries are vying for control of the undersea cables that carry the bulk of the world's internet traffic.

The United States has long been the dominant player in the undersea cable market. American companies own and operate the majority of the world's major cables. But China has been rapidly investing in new cables in recent years. In 2018, China surpassed the United States in the number of undersea cables it owns and operates. This growing Chinese investment in undersea cables has raised concerns in the United States.

The ongoing battle between the United States and China for control of the world's undersea cables is a major concern for the global economy. Whether motivated by economic dominance, national security concerns, or technological advancements, the control of undersea internet cables holds immense implications for global communication networks. Concerns regarding data security, privacy, and the digital divide are paramount when discussing the impact of this conflict on the internet's future, especially in regions outside the USA and China.

Beyond the immediate impact on global communication networks, the internet cables war has broader geopolitical consequences. Some major factors contributing to this conflict are; National Security Concerns: Each country perceives internet and data connectivity as critical for national security. The US considers China a potential cyber threat and fears that Chinese companies may use internet cables to spy or steal sensitive information. Similarly, China has concerns about US surveillance and potential interference with its networks.

In addition, the development and maintenance of undersea internet cables allow countries to exert control and influence over global digital communications. By controlling these cables, a nation can regulate data flow and potentially manipulate information. Both countries wish to assert their dominance in cyberspace. Furthermore, Internet cables serve as the backbone of global internet connectivity, enabling fast and reliable data transmission between countries. Both countries recognize the economic benefits of controlling or having extensive access to undersea cables.

Moreover, as two major powers in the digital realm, the US and China are vying for influence and attempting to counter each other's hegemony in the cyberspace. By challenging the dominance of American firms, China seeks to reduce its dependence on US-controlled internet infrastructure and promote its own technological standards and companies internationally.

The USA and China are engaged in an ongoing geopolitical rivalry, with both countries seeking to expand their global influence. This competition extends to the digital domain, where control over internet cables could amplify their power projection capabilities and influence over international affairs.

Some potential outcomes include: Disruption of internet connectivity: If undersea internet cables are damaged or cut intentionally during a cable war, it can disrupt the flow of internet traffic between countries and regions. This can result in a loss of connectivity, impacting businesses, individuals, and governments dependent on stable and fast internet access. Also, cutting off internet cables can lead to the isolation of certain regions or countries, making them less integrated with the broader global digital landscape.

During a cable war, adversaries may exploit the situation to launch cyberattacks on exposed systems, taking advantage of reduced communication and security measures. Additionally, governments involved in an internet cable war might attempt to control the flow of information by monitoring or censoring internet traffic passing through their territory. Again, disrupted internet connectivity and compromised data security can have substantial economic consequences. Businesses leveraging the internet for operations, communication, and international trade might experience interruptions or financial losses.

Similarly, the internet cable war might exacerbate geopolitical tensions between nations involved, potentially leading to a broader conflict. These tensions can have far-reaching implications beyond just internet connectivity and data security. The internet cable war might prompt countries to explore alternative ways to ensure internet connectivity and data security. This could involve investment in satellite-based internet solutions, exploring alternative cable routes, or strengthening domestic communication infrastructure.

Other countries and international organizations may play various roles in regulating and mediating disputes related to the internet cable war between the USA and China. The UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU) could work on coordinating global telecommunications networks. Also, the WTO can be involved in mediating commercial disputes arising from the internet cable war.

Furthermore, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) can play a role in facilitating negotiations and mediating between the US and China on internet cable matters. Moreover, Regional Organizations such as the European Union (EU), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), African Union (AU), can also participate in regulating and mediating disputes related to internet cables. These organizations often have policies and frameworks governing telecommunications, which can provide a basis for negotiations and resolution.

Hence, International Legal Frameworks can provide guidance in resolving disputes: Countries can refer to these legal frameworks to make their arguments and reach a resolution. International laws and treaties governing cyberspace, such as the United Nations' Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) and internet Governance Forums IGFs can be instrumental in mediating disputes and finding common ground between the US and China.

Overall, the internet cable war poses significant risks to global internet connectivity and data security, affecting economies, geopolitics, and individuals' digital rights and freedoms. Efforts to prevent or mitigate such conflicts are crucial to maintaining a stable and secure global internet ecosystem.

NEW DELHI: Internet speeds in India, especially for customers of Bharti Airtel, Tata Communications, and state-owned BSNL and MTNL are set to be disrupted for the next 20-25 days, after a key undersea cable, carrying data traffic across 14 countries, from Singapore to France, was cut off the coast of Egypt. Two other key cable networks, linking Asia to Europe, were also allegedly damaged.

The extent of the damage is still being assessed. “Currently, internet and data usage are low because of the festive season. India will feel the impact from Monday when offices and businesses come back. Telcos have diverted all traffic from the Atlantic route to the Pacific, but our connectivity to the latter route is not sufficient to cater to all of India’s traffic,” explained Rajesh Chharia, president at Association of Internet Service Providers of India.

Bharti Airtel said that the cable cuts had not impacted its voice traffic but said it was taking all ‘necessary steps to ensure data services were available to our customers by routing traffic on alternative routes’. BSNL executives said the company was diverted its traffic on other cables linking India with the Europe and the US, but declined to reveal the extent of internet disruptions here. Reliance Communications said its customers were not impacted as its cable systems, including FEA, FALCON, and HAWK, were not impacted when the undersea cables were allegedly sabotaged.

Executives with mobile phone companies, who did not want to be named, acknowledged that browsing speeds were likely to fall significantly in the coming days, even as they were unable to provide a timeframe as to when the problem will be resolved.

SANGER, ERIC SCHMITT","New York, NY, United States","1000000","2015-10-26","Chinese","The New York Times","**Title: Concerns Over Russian Attacks on Undersea Communication Cables**  

Washington — Russian submarines and spy ships are actively operating near critical undersea cables that transmit nearly all global internet communications. Some U.S. military and intelligence officials are concerned that Russia may attack these cables during times of heightened tension or conflict.  

During the Cold War, the U.S. feared that Russians would tap these cables — a capability that American intelligence agencies mastered decades ago. But the current concerns are more severe: Russia may cut fiber optic lines in the most inaccessible locations during extreme hacking operations against the U.S., disrupting real-time communications that Western governments, economies, and the public increasingly rely on.  

While there is currently no evidence of any cables being cut, senior military and intelligence officials in the U.S. and its allies are becoming increasingly alert to the accelerating activities of Russian armed forces around the world. Meanwhile, debates within Washington illustrate that the U.S. is growing more distrustful of every move Russia makes, reminiscent of the Cold War era.  

The Pentagon's assessments of Russia's increasing naval activities are highly classified and not openly discussed in detail. How to monitor these activities and how to quickly restore communications after cables have been cut are questions U.S. officials remain tight-lipped about. However, at least a dozen officials have confirmed, in vague terms, that this matter has garnered significant attention from the Pentagon.  

""I worry every day about what Russia might be doing,"" said Rear Adm. Frederick J. Roegge, commander of the U.S. Navy's Pacific submarine fleet, when asked about the possibility of Russia planning to cut undersea cables.  

U.S. Navy spokesman Cmdr. William Marks stated in Washington, ""Hearing that any country plans to attack communication cables is concerning; however, due to the secretive nature of submarine operations, we do not discuss specific details.""  

However, privately, the language from commanders and intelligence officials is far more direct. They say that from the North Sea to Northeast Asia, and even in waters closer to the U.S. coast, Russian activities have significantly increased along known cable routes. These cables are the lifelines of global electronic communication and commerce.  

Just last month, the Russian spy ship Yantar, equipped with two remotely operated deep-sea submersibles, slowly made its way from the U.S. East Coast toward Cuba, where a major cable lies near the Guantanamo Bay U.S. Navy base. American spy satellites, vessels, and aircraft have been monitoring that cruise. Navy officials say that Yantar and its submersibles have the capability to cut cables located several miles below the surface.  

""The level of activity is comparable to the Cold War,"" said a senior European diplomat.  

NATO ally Norway is so concerned that it has requested neighboring countries to help track Russian submarines.  

Adm. James Stavridis, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander and now dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, stated in an email last week, ""This example again shows that despite significant technological advancements, this extremely arrogant and aggressive regime seems to have regressed to using Cold War tactics.""  

These actions align with Russia's military expansion into Crimea, eastern Ukraine, and Syria. Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying to demonstrate that the reach of the Russian army, navy, and air force is much greater in these areas.  

""The risk here is that any country could disrupt this system in a completely covert way, without needing to deploy warships equipped with cable-cutting equipment to the region,"" said Michael Sechrist, former project director of a research project conducted in collaboration with Harvard and MIT, partially funded by the Defense Department.  

""Cable-cutting incidents happen frequently; sometimes they are cut by anchors dragged behind, and sometimes they are severed due to natural disasters,"" Sechrist said. He published a paper in 2012 discussing the vulnerabilities of the undersea cable network. However, most incidents occur a few miles from shore and can be repaired within days.  

What concerns Pentagon planners most is that Russia seems to be focusing on deeper vulnerabilities, where cables are difficult to monitor, and the damaged areas are hard to detect and repair.  

Sechrist noted that the locations of cables are hardly a secret. ""Since the 1860s, the paths of undersea cables have often been similar,"" he said, as cable service operators prefer to lay them in familiar environments with long-term agreements.  

The special cables commissioned by the U.S. for military operations are exceptions, kept secret and not appearing on widely circulated maps. Officials say Russia may be searching for such cables.  

The role of these cables is more critical than ever. More than $10 trillion in commercial activity flows through cables globally every day, including transactions settled by financial institutions every moment. Undersea cables also carry over 95% of daily communications.  

Undersea cables are so important that the Department of Homeland Security has designated their landing areas — mostly around New York, Miami, and Los Angeles — as the number one ""critical infrastructure.""","The article discusses the potential threat of Russian military actions targeting undersea communication cables, which are critical for global internet communication.

It highlights concerns about the cables being cut, the lack of current evidence for such actions, and the strategic importance of these cables in modern communication and commerce.

**Published Date:** October 27, 2015

**By Guido Olimpio**

After the Cold War, the U.S. has been increasingly aware of the unusual activities of several Russian ships. The New York Times, citing Pentagon sources, reported that Russian units and submarines are conducting missions near the cables that facilitate communications. These maneuvers occur in areas far from the U.S., alternating with patrols along the U.S. coastline. The U.S. Navy has explicitly expressed concerns that these operations could involve sabotage exercises or espionage activities.

In the spring of 2014, reports surfaced about the deep-sea tug ""Chiker,"" which had traveled from the Baltic Sea and was seen near sensitive sites in Florida and later in the Caribbean, possibly supporting submarines or conducting underwater work with specialized equipment.

Last month, the intelligence and oceanographic research ship ""Yantar"" was spotted, following a similar operational pattern as the ""Chiker,"" including a stop in Havana and a visit to the U.S. enclave of Guantanamo, where one of the many fiber optic cables runs. Other Russian vessels have operated in Europe, raising concerns among NATO partners. A diplomat noted that the situation resembles the Cold War era when NATO faced the Warsaw Pact. Norway has sought assistance from allied countries to monitor increasingly aggressive Russian activities. The number of so-called submarine patrols has reportedly increased by 50%, with significant attention to the Arctic, now a site of multinational competition. The U.S. Navy relies on submarines designed for delicate operations in rival waters and focuses on data collection.","The article discusses the presence of Russian ships near undersea communication cables and raises concerns about potential sabotage operations targeting these cables.

The New York Times highlights a new strategy from the Russian Navy, with warships and submarines patrolling aggressively in regions where American internet cables are located. A significant threat is posed by the Russian special vessel Yantar, which is heading towards Cuba and has recently been spotted in the Caribbean, close to U.S. coasts where most undersea cables pass.

Experts, like Stephen Blank, assert that the Russians aim to humiliate the U.S. and demonstrate that it cannot defend itself, projecting military power in the Atlantic Ocean to convey: ""We are here, take us seriously as we threaten your vital interests.""

The potential threat of piracy or cutting undersea internet cables is not just a concern for the U.S. but also for Europe, which could face a communications crisis affecting business ties across the continent.

Experts warn that if a more serious conflict arises between Russia and the West, Russian ships could intercept special communications by attaching devices to the undersea cables. These cables are crucial to the communication infrastructure, contrary to the common perception that data exists solely in the cloud, which, in reality, is under the ocean.

There are hundreds of undersea cables connecting Europe and the U.S., and while Washington may not be on high alert, European nations are increasingly worried about Russian military activity.

There are more than 15 undersea internet cables in the Red Sea. To have four damaged at a single time is ”exceptionally rare,” HGC said in a separate earlier statement.

The disruption of the cables did not disconnect any country from the internet, but the Wall Street Journal reports service in India, Pakistan, and parts of East Africa was noticeably degraded.

No services have yet offered a reason for the cuts. Yemen’s telecom ministry denied speculation it was responsible for the failures, saying it was “keen to keep all telecom submarine cables…away from any possible risks.”

Underwater cables are responsible for most of the internet’s data traffic. They’re cheaper than land-based cables, but are prone to damage from ships’ anchors.

**Author:** Doug Madory  
**Published Date:** 11/28/2023  

In this edition of the Cloud Observer, we dig into the impacts of recent submarine cable maintenance on intercontinental cloud connectivity and call for greater transparency from the submarine cable industry about incidents which cause critical cables to be taken out of service.

In recent weeks, two of the internet’s major submarine cable systems were down for repairs, impacting internet traffic between Europe and Asia. The major public clouds rely on the same submarine cable infrastructure as regular internet users, so when a cable incident occurs, cloud connectivity is also affected.

We’ll take a look at what we observed when Sea-Me-We-5 (SMW-5) and IMEWE were recently down for repairs.

Sea-Me-We-5’s name is an acronym that traces the geographic path the cable takes: Southeast Asia (SEA), Middle East (ME), Western Europe (WE). It was designated as ‘ready for service’ (RFS) in 2016 and is the fifth edition of a consortium-owned intercontinental submarine fiber optic cable carrying a large portion of the internet traffic between Europe and Asia.

On October 23, SMW-5 was taken down to repair a shunt fault, which occurs when seawater breaches the cable’s insulation, causing a short circuit. Submarine cables contain an electrical system that powers amplifiers placed every 70 km to maintain signal strength.

The loss of this major route between Asia and Europe was evident in latency measurements between our agents in cloud regions. Numerous routes experienced latency increases of around 40 ms. All three major public clouds experienced latency changes due to the loss of the cable.

Similar to SMW-5, IMEWE’s name derives from its route, heading east to west: India (I), Middle East (ME), Western Europe (WE) and was RFS in 2010. During the IMEWE outage, latency between AWS’s `eu-south-1` in Milan and `me-south-1` in Manama, Bahrain, dropped by 31ms.

Less than a month since the last troubleshooting was completed, the Asia America Gateway (AAG) submarine cable is now broken down again, substantially obstructing Vietnamese netizens’ international connection.

Internet service providers (ISPs) in Vietnam have confirmed that the submarine cable system faced an issue on May 14, causing Internet speed in the country to be disrupted.

A representative of a domestic ISP said all connections through the AAG system have been redirected through other systems to minimize the connection latency for users.

The cable system is notorious for its high frequency of recesses throughout the year.

The latest maintenance on the AAG cable system was completed less than a month ago, on April 21.

**E-mail, Facebook barely loading**

Duy Tung from Ho Chi Minh City has quite a few complaints about the sluggish Internet speed over the last few days.

“Gmail takes a while to open and even longer if there are attachments. Even Messenger continually reports failure to deliver messages. Most services with foreign hostings are slow these days,” Tung said, referring to Google’s email service and Facebook’s chat app.

Hong Uyen from District 5 in the southern metropolis also finds the speed bump disrupting her daily work.

Her job requires engagements in virtual conferences, to which the slightest fluctuation in Internet bandwidth can make a vexing experience.

“The average meeting lasts 30 to 60 minutes, yet the choppy Internet may drag it out twice as long. Everyone is frustrated at the bandwidth problem,” Uyen said.

According to customer feedback, the download speed of international services has significantly worsened, affecting work operations of various firms as well as general usage of the Vietnamese public.

“Our company is [letting employees] work from home via online tools, yet the Internet speed has halted many meetings. The work progress is naturally hindered, which causes us a great deal of frustration,” Uyen said.

A run of the Speedtest tool provided by the Vietnam Internet Network Information Center (VNNIC) to measure the Internet speed of a local ISP by Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper on Monday afternoon showed both upload and download speeds hovered around 10Mbps.

Another ISP returned a result of 20Mbps, which is much lower than the average of 61.69Mbps for fixed broadband Internet services of Vietnam announced by VNNIC in April.

**The endless loop of cable disruption**

The AAG is a 20,000-kilometer submarine communications cable system connecting Southeast Asia with the U.S. mainland across the Pacific Ocean via Guam and Hawaii.

It was put into operation in November 2009.

The segment connecting to Vietnam is 314 kilometers long and strikes land in Vung Tau City in the southern region, delivering up to two terabits per second.

The AAG system holds an extensive track record on international connection issues and has been blamed for many occasions where Internet speed slumped in Vietnam.

In November and December 2019, a malfunction in the system was detected and was not completely fixed until late January.

The cable went on to break down again in February, affecting domestic Internet speed until the problem was resolved in March.

IA and AAE-1, two other international Internet cable lines employed by Vietnamese ISPs, have exhibited the same pattern of issues.

Both faced problems since late 2019 and did not return to normalcy until early February.

Despite the ISPs’ claims of backup mechanisms in place regarding AAG malfunctions, the recent instances of Internet interruption speak volumes about the still-prominence status of the AAG cable system to Vietnamese users.","The article discusses the breakdown of the AAG submarine cable, detailing the frequency of disruptions and their impact on internet speed in Vietnam.

*Published on 01/28/2025 by Mercy A. Kuo*  

In a recent incident, a Chinese-owned cargo vessel, Shunxing-39, cut undersea fiber-optic cables near Taiwan’s Keelung Harbor. What does this signal to Taipei?  

The employment of third-country flagged cargo vessels to carry out undersea cable and pipeline sabotage operations appears to be a new element in Beijing’s ongoing gray zone warfare against Taiwan. China is exploiting the weaknesses in Taiwan’s position as an island nation dependent on maritime commerce and communications, while hiding behind commercial ships flying so-called “flags-of-convenience” (such as Tanzania and Cameroon) to deflect blame.  

**Analyze the intentions behind Chinese vessels’ cutting undersea cables in the Baltic Sea in November last year.**  

What we appear to be seeing is a growing Russia-China gray zone collaboration, perhaps moving in the direction of a full-fledged “axis.” Beijing can surreptitiously aid Moscow in its far-away European fight, which adds one more layer of deniability to the attribution of responsibility. Likewise, we have seen indications of Russian-ported vessels conducting suspicious activities off of Taiwan’s coast.  

**Examine undersea cable sabotage as an emerging trend in China’s gray zone warfare.**  

China continues to expand its already vast gray zone toolkit, having long ago calculated that its willingness to blur the lines between peace and hostilities provides it with an asymmetric advantage. Previously unheard of activities – such as turning lonely reefs into major South China Sea military bases; employing fishing vessels as paramilitary forces; or surveying and patrolling other nations’ waters as a means of expanding sovereign claims – are examples of how Beijing wins in the gray zone while its adversaries are still trying to diagnose the problem within their neat categories of laws and norms.  

With China’s coastline ringed by U.S. partners and allies, China has determined to attack their natural vulnerabilities as island nations. Cable and pipeline sabotage is more than mere harassment; it is a reminder that Beijing has the ability to cause far more damage to its enemies, should it choose to do so. This adds to its coercive power over those countries as it seeks regional hegemony.  

**How can targeted countries of cable sabotage pre-empt and mitigate future risks?**  

Subsea cables are especially vulnerable to sabotage or even exploitation, as they are extremely long, difficult to monitor, and unprotected against a determined adversary. If nothing else, these events should alert governments and private-sector providers that the seabed is no longer insulated from malign actors.  

This will put a premium on hardening subsea cables and pipelines, which will make them more expensive to manufacture and deploy. It will also require governments to invest in much more sophisticated undersea surveillance systems, and in building redundant delivery methods so that any one break doesn’t cripple an entire economy.  

**Assess China’s undersea cable sabotage strategy in the broader context of China-U.S. strategic rivalry.**  

What we are witnessing is a much more brazen Beijing now employing full-spectrum gray zone tactics behind vanishingly thin facades of opacity or deniability. China seems much less concerned about reputational costs, calculating that any international outrage will be limited and manageable.  

This reflects both its strategy and its experience. China’s experience has been that international outrage is fleeting and of minimal real cost, while its strategy is to normalize increasingly aggressive behavior so that lower levels of aggression become routine and barely noted. We’ve seen this play out across many domains, including in the air, on or under the sea, in cyberspace, and through lawfare. So accustomed has the world become to it that incidents that used to generate headlines now barely receive public mention.","The article titled 'China’s Undersea Cable Sabotage' discusses specific incidents of undersea cable cutting, particularly an incident involving the vessel Shunxing-39 cutting cables near Taiwan.

That the Chinese survey ship Haiyang Dizhi 8 and its escorts have blatantly disrupted and interfered with Vietnam’s economic activities has caused concerns about regional security.

The Chinese ships’ illegal moves in the waters inside Vietnam’s Exclusive Economic Zone and Continental Shelf near the Tu Chinh – Vung May (Vanguard Bank – Rifleman Bank) region since July 3 until now has compromised energy security and the free energy market in the short and long run.

**Impact on oil supply**

The East Vietnam Sea potentially has vast resources of oil and gas. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that the sea contains approximately 11 billion barrels of oil and 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in proved and probable reserves. The Vanguard Bank is located in an area rich in these natural resources, to the west of Vietnam’s Truong Sa (Spratly) archipelago.

The reserves can meet the rising demand for energy in Southeast Asia.

During the past decade, Vietnam has become an important producer of oil in Southeast Asia. Vietnam has sped up the exploration of oil sources, allowed foreign energy companies to pour in more investments, and cooperated with them in tapping its resources.

However, China’s efforts to disrupt and hinder relevant parties’ oil and gas activities, especially Vietnam’s, in the East Vietnam Sea will adversely affect oil supply and energy security in the region.

China has tried every way to interfere with Vietnam’s oil and gas exploration, from cutting its survey ship’s cables to pressuring the country and obstructing the implementation of its exploitation agreements.

Most recently, China has sent the survey ship Haiyang Dizhi 8 and the heavily armed Coast Guard vessel 35111 to carry out provocative actions around Japan’s oil rig Hakuryu-5 at Block 06-01 belonging to the Nam Con Son Basin project, Vietnam’s joint venture with Russia.

**Obstructing oil transport route**

Not only is Vietnam’s oil supply seriously disrupted but the probability of a conflict would threaten maritime routes, particularly the shipping of oil through the region.

The East Vietnam Sea is part of the world’s arterial waterway connecting the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. Over 200 ships sail through the Malacca Strait every day, translating into 63,000 vessels a year, which transport 80 percent of the oil shipped to Northeast Asia. The shipments are estimated to amount to 525 million metric tons, worth a combined US$390 billion.

Besides, estimates show that Asia’s crude oil imports will rise to 31 million barrels a day in 2030 from 19 million barrels a day in 2014.

Therefore, it is critical that China stop all disruptive actions, withdraw all ships from the Vietnamese waters, and refrain from any escalation that may elevate the risk of a regional energy crisis.","The article explicitly mentions the act of cutting cables in the context of China's interference with Vietnam's oil and gas exploration.

While the issue with the AAG undersea cable has not been resolved, an additional disruption has occurred with the APG cable, significantly affecting Vietnam's internet connection speed to international networks.

According to information from several telecommunications companies, the APG (Asia Pacific Gateway) international undersea cable encountered problems on May 23, resulting in a complete loss of internet traffic from Vietnam to international networks.

Combined with the ongoing issues with the AAG cable, this has severely impacted the internet access speed for users in Vietnam.

Many users have reported difficulties accessing Facebook, Gmail, and YouTube, often having to wait a long time for pages to load.

The cause of the APG cable disruption is still under investigation, and repair plans will be communicated by international partners soon.

The APG cable, operational since late 2016, has a maximum bandwidth capacity of 54 Tbps and stretches approximately 10,400 km under the Pacific Ocean. It connects to China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Following the discovery of the APG cable issue, telecommunications companies have implemented measures to redirect traffic to alternative land and undersea cables.

However, the simultaneous disruption of both the APG and AAG cables has created significant challenges for users, particularly when accessing foreign services such as Facebook, Gmail, and Netflix.

On May 14, the AAG cable experienced its second disruption of 2020, affecting the quality of international internet services. The cause was identified as a fault in the S1H branch, located 107.7 km from the Vung Tau landing station.

The AAG cable, with a total length of 20,191 km, has been in operation since November 2009, directly connecting Southeast Asia to the United States, passing through Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Brunei, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and the US.

It has landing points in the US, Hawaii, Guam, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, and Vietnam. Development of the AAG cable system was funded at a cost of US$500 million by 19 partners.

The cable has encountered frequent breaks and outages since it was first put into use in late 2009.","The article discusses the Asia-America Gateway (AAG), an undersea fiber optic cable system that was cut off the coast of Vung Tau, Vietnam, on December 20, 2013.

"Geopolitical Tensions Over Undersea Internet Cables","27 cable cuts in five years raise concerns over internet security and military implications amid rising tensions with China.","https://www.voanews.com/a/tensions-with-china-emerge-over-undersea-cables-carrying-internet-traffic/7027809.html","","Xiaoshan Xue, Adrianna Zhang",Yes,"Xiaoshan Xue, Adrianna Zhang","Washington, D.C.","3260000","2023-03-29","Mandarin","Voice of America (VOA)","**Tensions With China Emerge Over Undersea Cables Carrying Internet Traffic**  
Undersea cables that carry the bulk of intercontinental internet traffic are increasingly the focal point of geopolitical tensions involving China, according to experts.

Justin Sherman, a fellow at the Cyber Statecraft Initiative of the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank, told Reuters, ""When we talk about U.S.-China tech competition, when we talk about espionage and the capture of data, submarine cables are involved in every aspect of those rising geopolitical tensions.""

The cables are a hot spot in China's relations with Taiwan, a self-governing island that Beijing considers its own territory — a long-standing point of contention between the U.S. and China.

Last month, the cables were cut between Taiwan and the Matsu Islands, which are controlled by Taiwan but lie just off the coast of China. Taiwan's government stopped short of accusing the Chinese government of cutting the cables on purpose, and the National Communications Commission said two ships severed the cables accidentally.

The cables have been cut 27 times during the past five years, according to data from Taiwan's Chungwha Telecom. Each cable is about as wide as a garden hose once the fiber-optic technology inside is wrapped with insulating materials so it can be laid on the seabed, where it is exposed to threats including earthquakes, typhoons, ships' anchors and saboteurs.

Elisabeth Braw, a senior researcher at the American Enterprise Institute, speculated that the cut cables may be the result of targeted harassment of Taiwan by China. She told VOA Mandarin that over the past few years, ""Chinese fishing vessels and other commercial vessels have been harming the cables connecting the Matsu islands to Taiwan a disproportionate number of times. … And the challenge for Taiwan is that it's not a military attack.""

The loss of the internet cables and the connectivity they provide has huge military implications, as Russia has shown by targeting internet infrastructure in its assault on Ukraine.

Joseph Hwang, an affiliate faculty member at George Mason University, told VOA Mandarin that fixing the cables severed last month would take time and money.

He suggested that Taiwan, U.S. and Asian allies should strengthen undersea infrastructure by investing in cable armor, deeper burial and decoy cables, and consider establishing legal frameworks that clearly explain the consequences of accidental or intentional underwater cable destruction.

In at least six private undersea cable deals over the past four years, the U.S. government has either intervened to keep HMN Tech, a subsidiary of the sanctioned Chinese firm Huawei, out of the undersea cable business in the Asia-Pacific region or it has forced the rerouting or abandonment of cables that would have directly linked U.S. and Chinese territories.

As of early 2023, there were more than 550 active and planned submarine cables worldwide, with undersea cables carrying over 99.4% of intercontinental internet traffic. Cables can carry far more data at far less cost than satellites.

This is the third time that the AAG has ruptured this year, following breaks in January and May.

Vietnam’s millions of internet users and millions of football fans are not a happy lot this weekend.

They have just heard that service on the Asia America Gateway (AAG) cable has been disrupted, which means sluggish access to international websites, at a time the football World Cup, the most followed sporting event in the world, is underway in Russia.

A local internet service provider said unstable power supply could be the cause, and no repair schedule has been announced, a Vietnam News Agency report said.

The disruption will affect all service providers in Vietnam, it added.

Connected in November 2009, the $560-million AAG cable handles more than 60 percent of the country’s international internet traffic. The system runs more than 20,000 kilometers (12,420 miles), connecting Southeast Asia and the U.S., passing through Brunei, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Since its debut, the cable has encountered a ""very high"" risk of rupture and been under frequent repair, affecting all service providers in Vietnam.

The cable suffered technical errors at least five times in 2017.

Vietnam currently has six submarine cable systems, as well as a 120 gigabit channel that runs overland through China. With a download speed of 5.46 megabytes per second, Vietnam's internet speed was ranked 74th out of 189 countries and territories in a global survey of broadband speeds compiled by Cable.co.uk, a U.K. broadband, TV, phone and mobile provider, last August.

Vietnam's average broadband speed is 10 times lower than its Southeast Asian neighbor Singapore, according to the survey. However, the country still managed to trump six other countries in the region.

Once again, damage has been reported to an undersea cable in the Baltic Sea - this time affecting a connection between Latvia and Sweden. Latvia suspects external influence, and the Navy responded immediately.  

On Sunday morning, damage was reported to the fiber optic connection to Latvia. The location of the damage is in Sweden's exclusive economic zone, according to Latvian authorities during a press conference. Initial indications suggest that the damage is due to external influence.  

The cause remains unclear. The cable belonging to the Latvian state broadcasting and television center was damaged in the maritime area between Ventspils and Gotland, as reported by the authorities in Riga.

Latvian Prime Minister Evika Silina stated after an extraordinary cabinet meeting: ""We have determined that there is most likely external damage, and that this is significant."" Latvia is coordinating with NATO and countries in the Baltic region to clarify the circumstances.  

The Latvian Navy dispatched a patrol boat to a ship that was near the damage site. No suspicious activities on board or damage to the anchor were reported, according to Navy Chief Maris Polencs. The inspected ship was en route to Russia and is waiting for the next clearance from the ship's agent to proceed.  

Two other ships in the area are also under investigation, the Navy reported.  

According to NATO, ships and aircraft are deployed alongside regional allies to investigate the incident. ""The presence of allies in the region allows for a swift and coordinated response,"" said a NATO spokesperson to the dpa news agency.  

In Sweden, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson announced that the country would work closely with Latvia. ""Sweden will contribute important expertise to the ongoing efforts to investigate the alleged incident.""

There was a breakage at a cable section located about 130 km from a shoreline station in Singapore, causing a total loss of international data from Vietnam to Singapore through the IA cable.  
  
The latest breakage means that only one undersea cable connecting Vietnam globally, the SMW3, remains fully functional.  
  
Vietnam is currently connected with seven undersea cables: SMW3, AAG, IA, APG, AAE-1, SJC2 and ADC. Besides the recent breakage of the IA, problems with the AAE, AAG and APG cables that have been present since 2022 and early 2023 have yet to be fully resolved.  
  
The SJC2 and the ADC are yet to be officially operational, while the SMW3 cable is outdated and about to be decommissioned.

Published Mar 20, 2018 9:27 PM by CIMSEC

For centuries, the sea has enabled trade between nations. Shipping continues to underpin international commerce today. But there is another unseen contribution that the oceans make to the current global order. Deep below the waters, travelling at millions of miles per hour, flickers of light relay incredible quantities of information across the world, powering the exchange of data that forms the internet. From urgent stock market transactions to endless videos of cats, undersea cables support many aspects of twenty-first century life that we take for granted. A moment’s thought is sufficient to appreciate the strategic importance of this fact. As a result, any discussion of future seabed warfare would be incomplete without a consideration of the challenges presented by ensuring the security of this vital infrastructure.

Strategists have neglected submarine cables. Whilst topics such as piracy and cyber attacks on ports frequently arise in discussions on maritime threats, cables have not always been as prominent. Some authors have identified the potential risks, but these works have not always received the attention they deserve.

There are signs that this is changing. A recent report for the Policy Exchange by Rishi Sunak, a member of the UK Parliament, gained significant media coverage. It was not ignored by senior military figures. A few weeks later, the United Kingdom Chief of Defence Staff, Air Chief Marshall Sir Stuart Peach, gave a speech to RUSI, where he said “there is a new risk to our way of life that is the vulnerability of the cables that crisscross the seabed.” The same month, Mark Sedwill, the UK National Security Advisor, gave evidence that “you can achieve the same effect as used to be achieved in, say, World War Two by bombing the London docks or taking out a power station by going after the physical infrastructure of cyberspace in the form of internet undersea cables.”

This is a present threat, not just a hypothetical one. In late 2017, NATO Submarine Commander Rear Admiral Lennon (USN) revealed that “we are now seeing Russian underwater activity in the vicinity of undersea cables that I don’t believe we have ever seen. Russia is clearly taking an interest in NATO and NATO nations’ undersea infrastructure.” The challenge is to maintain this focus and turn a passing spotlight into seriously considered policy.

**Understanding Submarine Cables**

Vast technical expertise is not necessary to understand why submarine cables are so important. A basic awareness of their construction and use is sufficient. The internet is, at its most basic level, a transfer of information. With the advent of cloud computing, the simple act of storing a file means that data travels from a user on one continent to a server halfway around the world. Although popular imagination sees this happening by satellite relay, in over ninety-five percent of cases the physical means for moving this information is a series of light pulses, travelling along a fiber optic cable laid over land and under the sea. These cables are thin silica tubes embedded in a protective cladding, approximately the size of a garden hosepipe. The capacity of these cables to transmit data is ever-increasing. Recent experimental cables have been reported as being capable of transmitting up to one petabyte of data per second. To add some perspective, a petabyte of storage would allow you to store enough music that you could play it continuously for two thousand years.

Submarine cables are mainly private assets. Although expensive (an intercontinental cable is cited as costing between $100 million to $500 million), they are significantly cheaper than the satellite alternatives. In addition to the ownership by telecommunications companies, internet companies, including Facebook and Google, now heavily invest in submarine cables. These cables are laid by specialized ships, capable of carrying up to 2000km of cable, which can be laid at a rate of up to 200km per day. In offshore areas, the cable is laid directly onto the seabed. On the continental shelf, a plough is used to bury the cables and provide some protection from accidental damage, usually caused by anchors.

**Attacks on Submarine Cables**

These cables are vulnerable to deliberate attack in many ways. The most basic method of attack is simply to break the cable. Their construction means that this task presents little difficulty either mechanically or through the use of small explosive charges. Finding these cables is equally simple. The location of the cables is widely promulgated in order to prevent accidental damage but there is little to stop adversaries from exploiting this information for nefarious ends. Whilst there are a network of repair ships around the world, it is obvious that any service denial cannot be instantly fixed. Multiple attacks, particularly on alternative cable routes, would quickly exacerbate problems and could be organized relatively easily. As the Policy Exchange report highlighted, there is no need to actually proceed to sea to attack the cable network. The landing stations, locations where the submarine cables come ashore, are both well-known and lightly protected. This is a potent combination, particularly when cables are located in fragile states and presents additional challenges when assessing the security of the network.

Cables can also be attacked in non-physical ways. Although shrouded in classification, intelligence analysts have openly stated in national newspapers that the U.S. submarine USS Jimmy Carter may have the capability to ""tap"" undersea cables and obtain the data being transferred without breaching the cable. There are concerns that the Russian Yantar vessels share similar capabilities. Military planners must understand that defending the submarine cable network might not mean simply preventing physical attack but also ensuring the integrity of the data being transmitted.

**Legal Protections**

Legally, the status of undersea cables have little protection, particularly when they are outside the jurisdiction of any state and lie on the seabed of the high seas. This is certainly the conclusion of the two major legal studies that have addressed the problem. Professor Heintschel von Heinegg considered submarine cyber infrastructure in a chapter of a NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence publication in 2013 and concluded that “the current legal regime has gaps and loopholes and that it no longer adequately protects submarine cables.” Similarly in 2015, Tara Davenport of Yale Law School examined the same topic and stated “the present legal regime is deficient in ensuring the security of cables.” The peacetime protection of submarine cables is a grey area in the law and this provides an additional challenge when assessing how cables should be protected.

The legal status of submarine cables in times of war is equally unclear. There is no authoritative work examining the status of submarine cables in armed conflicts, but even a brief overview is sufficient to highlight the problem. The first question is whether an attack on a submarine cable (outside of a state’s jurisdiction) qualifies as an “armed attack” for the purposes of article 51 of the UN Charter, permitting the use of force by a state in self-defense. The Tallinn Manual on the Law Applicable to Cyber Operations takes the position that the effects of a cyber operation must be analogous to those resulting from a “standard” kinetic armed attack. Simultaneously, it acknowledges that the law is unclear as to when a cyber operation qualifies as an armed attack. Would the consequences of a submarine cable breach be sufficiently serious to raise it to the level of an armed attack? It is difficult to provide a definitive answer but if the answer is ‘no’, then states would not be entitled to use military force to defend submarine cables in the absence of an existing armed conflict. With regard to illicit surveillance of cables, the Tallinn Manual clearly concludes that intelligence gathering from submarine cables would not amount to an armed attack.

The ability of States to target submarine cables during times of war is also open to discussion. Objects may be targeted under international humanitarian law if they make an effective contribution to military action due to their nature, location, purpose, or use and if their total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization offers a definite military advantage. The best example of the extent of military reliance on civilian owned and operated undersea cables is contained in a 2010 Belfer Center paper. This records that three of the largest cables between Italy and Egypt were severed in late 2008. As a result, U.S. UAV operations in Iraq were significantly reduced. Submarine cables simultaneously transmit critical military and civilian data. Whilst the presence of the former means that they may be targeted, this is always subject to the principles of proportionality and precautions in attack, designed to minimize the harm to the civilian population. Due to the range of data carried by cables and the number of services that are likely to be affected, these assessments may be very difficult to carry out. An understanding of when cables can be targeted is likely to be highly fact sensitive and it is entirely possible that states will take different views on when this is permissible.

The problem on the APG cable system has negatively impacted international connection in the Southeast Asian country, a representative of a local Internet service provider (ISP) stated.

Domestic ISPs have redirected all connections through the APG system to other cables in order to minimize the connection disruption.

According to the Vietnam Internet Association, international connection in Vietnam relies on multiple submarine cable systems, namely the APG, AAG, SMW3, Intra-Asia (IA), and Asia-Africa-Europe 1 (AAE-1).

The APG, which runs about 10,400 kilometers underwater across the Pacific Ocean, connects Vietnam with mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Singapore.

The cable system was launched in 2016 with a traffic capacity of 54.8 terabits per second – the largest of any other cables in Asia – and had been expected to provide more stable connection for Vietnamese Internet users.

Many popular Vietnamese ISPs such as VNPT, Viettel, FPT Telecom, and CMC Telecom are using this cable system for their services.

The reason behind the problem has yet to be identified, while repair plans will be announced in the upcoming days.

The **AAG cable system** previously broke down for the second time this year on May 14, causing Internet speed in the country to be latent.

Cable breaks or faults on subsea optical cables can impact global digital connectivity and have costly ramifications for businesses and internet users. Three such incidents impacted users on the African continent in 2020 alone. Each year more than a hundred cable breaks are recorded across the world causing disruptions to communications and connectivity.

A recent study conducted by Professor Peter J. Talling and a team from the Departments of Earth Sciences and Geography, from the University of Durham in the UK, co-led by Angola Cables and supported by industry members including, the Vodafone Group, British Telecom, NERC Environmental and others, has delivered important findings presenting valuable insights for the routing and protection of future subsea cables.

In January 2020, the South Atlantic 3/West Africa (SAT-3/Wasc) cable, linking Africa to Portugal and Spain was hit by a breakdown in Gabon, whilst the West Africa Cable System (Wacs) that connects South Africa to the United Kingdom saw an outage off the coast of the DRC Congo.

In March, the WACS cable experienced a further break affecting international bandwidth. Whilst many ISPs suffered extended outage periods, most of the major mobile operators were able to mitigate the impact on internet traffic due to their redundancy measures and were in a position to redirect data traffic to other subsea cable networks. Large telcos and mobile operators often employ a divergent strategy to ensure they have alternative routings in place should one of their data carrying cables be affected.

**Threats to subsea cables**

It is estimated that around 1.2 million kilometres of subsea cable carrying power and transmitting data currently transverse continents and geographies across the world. Most of these cables are either buried in the seabed or rest on the ocean floor.

Nearly 75% of the damage caused to these cables are the result of being snagged or damaged by the anchors of ships. Deep see cable faults in water depths of more than 1,000 metres below the sea level, are almost always caused by natural events such as current abrasion, underwater landslides and underwater seismic activity. Often the problem with deep water faults is that they are not as easy to detect and can impact multiple cables – making recovery and repair efforts both lengthy and costly to cable operators.

The cable fault on the SAT-3 was likely caused by an exceptionally large and powerful submarine mud slide that originated at the mouth of the Congo River, just 10 days after the Congo River recorded its largest flood since the 1960s. Sand and mud from the river flood was presumably remobilised, triggering the submarine mud slide that flowed through the offshore Congo Canyon. The canyon is one of the largest underwater canyons on earth, cutting across the continental shelf of West Africa for 85 kilometres until it reaches the shelf edge, then continues down the slope and ends 280 kilometres from its origin. At its deepest point, the V-shaped canyon walls are 1100 meters in height.

These powerful mud slides that damage seabed cables are notoriously difficult to measure in action and are thus poorly understood. The international study undertaken involved the placement of a series of sensors along the canyon, and these sensors that recorded unique information on this type of mud slide. According to observations by Professor Talling and the team, “the data that we recovered from the seabed sensor and mooring data sets within the Congo Canyon have revealed that the undersea mudslide is possibly the longest recorded sediment flow yet measured in action on our planet.”

The evidence gathered provided valuable scientific insights into how major flows are triggered; the frequency, speed and potential impact of mudslides or runout events – the longer the runout the more hazardous these mudslides can be for undersea cables. The other important conclusion was that some cables do not break, but adjacent cables can experience faults by virtue of their location or next to deeply eroded knickpoints.

The January 2020 event caused 9 of the oceanographic moorings to surface. By combining the timings of when moorings reached the sea surface and the cable breaks, Professor Talling and his team were able to calculate the flow speed of the massive undersea avalanche. It has been estimated that following the initial mudslide in the canyon, the moving sediment increased in speed from 5 m/s in Angolan waters in the upper canyon, to reach 8 m/s in the deep ocean, at water depths of 4-5 km – running out some 1,200 km from the river mouth.

“Depending on the proximity of cable repair vessels, outages can often take a number of weeks to repair resulting in costly losses to economies impacted by such breaks,” notes Talling, “Gathering evidence and the recorded data in studies such as these are critical to understanding the nature of such subterranean events, and how the subsea cable industry can better provide more durable solutions in keeping the cables – and the world connected.”

Four separate underwater data cables have been damaged in the Red Sea, impacting global internet connectivity. The cuts have impacted four telecommunications companies and forced about 25% of internet traffic in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East to be rerouted.

Warnings have circulated in recent weeks that Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels could target subsea cables. The Houthis, who have been attacking commercial vessels in the Red Sea in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, have recently renewed promises to target U.S. and U.K. military ships. The militant group has denied any involvement in cutting the cables.

### SIGNALS

**Semafor Signals:** Global insights on today's biggest stories.

### It would take coordinated effort to bring a nation off-grid

Underwater internet cables in the Red Sea carry nearly all of the data and financial communications between Europe and Asia. Targeting the cables therefore disrupts critical infrastructure — and the Houthis posted veiled threats on Telegram as early as December that they may disrupt fiber optic cables that run across the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. While the cuts have disrupted internet connections, they are also resilient, one expert told the outlet: “It would be extremely difficult to completely disconnect a well-connected country. It would require a very sophisticated and coordinated attack to take them out all at the same time.”

### Replacing cut lines is expensive and dangerous

Costs to insure cable ships have skyrocketed in recent weeks, with some insurers charging as much as $150,000 per day. It is also a dangerous task for the slow-moving ships that lay the cables across the seabed as they come under increasing threat of attacks from the Houthis. Since the region is currently contested, shipping companies have sought relationships with regulators on both sides of Yemen’s civil war to avoid antagonizing either party. The cables are at risk even without the threat of direct attacks: Anchors from ships and fishing can damage the lines, and about 150 service issues are recorded each year from accidental causes.","The article titled 'Severed Red Sea data cables disrupt global internet connections' discusses the damage to four underwater data cables in the Red Sea, which has significantly impacted global internet connectivity.

NANGAN, Taiwan (AP) — In the past month, bed and breakfast owner Chen Yu-lin had to tell his guests he couldn’t provide them with the internet.  
Others living on Matsu, one of Taiwan’s outlying islands closer to neighboring China, had to struggle with paying electricity bills, making a doctor’s appointment or receiving a package.  
For connecting to the outside world, Matsu’s 14,000 residents rely on two submarine internet cables leading to Taiwan’s main island. The National Communications Commission, citing the island’s telecom service, blamed two Chinese ships for cutting the cables. It said a Chinese fishing vessel is suspected of severing the first cable some 50 kilometers (31 miles) out at sea. Six days later, on Feb. 8, a Chinese cargo ship cut the second, NCC said.  
Taiwan’s government stopped short of calling it a deliberate act on the part of Beijing, and there was no direct evidence to show the Chinese ships were responsible.  
The islanders in the meantime were forced to hook up to a limited internet via microwave radio transmission, a more mature technology, as backup. It means one could wait hours to send a text. Calls would drop, and videos were unwatchable.  
“A lot of tourists would cancel their booking because there’s no internet. Nowadays, the internet plays a very large role in people’s lives,” said Chen, who lives in Beigan, one of Matsu’s main residential islands.  
Apart from disrupting lives, the loss of the internet cables, seemingly innocuous, has huge implications for national security.  
As the full-scale invasion of Ukraine has shown, Russia has made taking out internet infrastructure one of the key parts of its strategy. Some experts suspect China may have cut the cables deliberately as part of its harassment of the self-ruled island it considers part of its territory, to be reunited by force if necessary.  
China regularly sends warplanes and navy ships toward Taiwan as part of tactics to intimidate the island’s democratic government. Concerns about China’s invasion, and Taiwan’s preparedness to withstand it, have increased since the war in Ukraine.  
The cables had been cut a total of 27 times in the past five years, but it was unclear which country the vessels hailed from, based on data from Chunghwa Telecom.  
Taiwan’s coast guard gave chase to the fishing vessel that cut the first cable on Feb. 2, but it went back to Chinese waters, according to an official who was briefed on the incident and was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Authorities found two Chinese ships in the area where the cables were cut, based on automated identification system data, similar to GPS, which shows a vessel’s location.  
“We can’t rule out that China destroyed these on purpose,” said Su Tzu-yun, a defense expert at the government think tank, Institute for National Defense and Security Research, citing a research that only China and Russia had the technical capabilities to do this. “Taiwan needs to invest more resources in repairing and protecting the cables.”  
Internet cables, which can be anywhere between 20 millimeters to 30 millimeters (0.79 inches to 1.18 inches) wide, are encased in steel armor in shallow waters where they’re more likely to run into ships. Despite the protection, cables can get cut quite easily by ships and their anchors, or fishing boats using steel nets.  
Even so, “this level of breakage is highly unusual for a cable, even in the shallow waters of the Taiwan Strait,” said Geoff Huston, chief scientist at Asia Pacific Network Information Centre, a non-profit that manages and distributes Internet resources like IP addresses for the region.  
Without a stable internet, coffee shop owner Chiu Sih-chi said seeing the doctor for his toddler son’s cold became a hassle because first they had to visit the hospital to just get an appointment.  
A breakfast shop owner said she lost thousands of dollars in the past few weeks because she usually takes online orders. Customers would come to her stall expecting the food to be ready when she hadn’t even seen their messages.  
Faced with unusual difficulties, Matsu residents came up with all sorts of ways to organize their lives.  
One couple planned to deal with the coming peak season by having one person stay in Taiwan to access their reservation system and passing the information on to the other via text messages. Wife Lin Hsian-wen extended her vacation in Taiwan during the off-season when she heard the internet back home wasn’t working and is returning to Matsu later in the week.  
Some enterprising residents went across to the other shore to buy SIM cards from Chinese telecoms, though those only work well in the spots closer to the Chinese coast, which is only 10 kilometers (6.21 miles) away at its closest point.  
Others, like the bed and breakfast owner Tsao Li-yu, would go to Chunghwa Telecom’s office to use a Wi-Fi hot spot the company had set up for locals to use in the meantime.  
“I was going to work at (Chunghwa Telecom),” Tsao joked.  
Chunghwa had set up microwave transmission as backup for the residents. Broadcast from Yangmingshan, a mountain just outside of Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, the relay beams the signals some 200 kilometers (124 miles) across to Matsu. Since Sunday, speeds were noticeably faster, residents said.  
Wang Chung Ming, the head of Lienchiang County, as the Matsu islands are officially called, said he and the legislator from Matsu went to Taipei shortly after the internet broke down to ask for help, and was told they would get priority in any future internet backup plans.  
Taiwan’s Ministry of Digital Affairs publicly asked for bids from low-Earth orbit satellite operators to provide the internet in a backup plan, after seeing Russia’s cyberattacks in the invasion of Ukraine, the head of the ministry, Audrey Tang, told The Washington Post last fall. The ministry said the project does not fall under the law that requires providers to be at least 51% owned by a domestic shareholder.  
A spokesperson for the Digital Ministry directed questions about the progress of backup plans to the National Communications Commission. NCC said it will install a surveillance system for the undersea cables, while relying on microwave transmission as a backup option.  
Many Pacific island nations, before they started using internet cables, depended on satellites — and some still do — as backup, said Jonathan Brewer, a telecommunications consultant from New Zealand who works across Asia and the Pacific.  
There’s also the question of cost. Repairing the cables is expensive, with an early estimate of $30 million New Taiwan Dollars ($1 million) for the work of the ships alone.  
“The Chinese boats that damaged the cables should be held accountable and pay compensation for the highly expensive repairs,” said Wen Lii, the head of the Matsu chapter of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.  
Wang, the head of Lienchiang County, said he had mentioned the cables on a recent visit to China, where he had met an executive from China Mobile. They offered to send technicians to help. But compensation, he said, will require providing hard proof on who did it.  
China’s Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a faxed request for comment.  
For now, the only thing residents can do is wait. The earliest cable-laying ships can come is April 20, because there are a limited number of vessels that can do the job.  
A month without functional internet has its upsides too. Chen Yu-lin, the bed and breakfast owner, has felt more at peace.  
It was hard in the first week, but Chen quickly got used to it. “From a life perspective, I think it’s much more comfortable because you get fewer calls,” he said, adding he was spending more time with his son, who usually is playing games online.  
At a web cafe where off-duty soldiers were playing offline games, the effect was the same.  
“Our relationships have become a bit closer,” said one soldier who only gave his first name, Samuel. “Because normally when there’s internet, everyone keeps to themselves, and now we’re more connected.","The article discusses the cutting of undersea internet cables that connect the Matsu islands to Taiwan.

Firms across the Middle East, India and Bangladesh are experiencing disruption after undersea broadband cables were damaged between Egypt and Italy.

India is home to an $11bn (£5.5bn) outsourcing industry, but UK firms say they have so far seen little impact.

The disruption looks set to continue, with repairs to take another week, and after another broadband cable was cut between the UAE and Oman.

British Telecom said it was able to quickly re-route its data.

""Because the internet is down, it means we are cut off from the head office.""

""All in all we didn't have a major impact,"" Sridhar Sriramaneni, vice president of support services at Knoah Solutions, told the BBC. His firm has clients in the UK.

""We had a minor impact for 30 minutes to an hour. We've experienced slowness.""

India's banks and stock exchange also experienced problems on Thursday. Up to 60% of India's 50 million internet users, both individuals and companies, were affected.

India's IT industry employs 700,000, who work for companies that provide a range of services - from answering customer queries to analysing equity markets - to global clients.

Most of the big outsourcing firms have back-up plans in place that allow them to quickly restore services. But they could still experience some small problems says Eric Schoonover, director of research at TeleGeography.

""The emergency routes they are using are not as reliable,"" he said. ""The phone quality could be lower and there could be a slight delay.""

For smaller firms that don't have contingency plans the patchy internet access has proved to be a big headache.

""We have a lot of offices connected by the net so because the internet is down means we are cut off from the head office,"" said Vikas Jain, assistant vice president at AEZ Group, a real estate developer. ""We are facing a lot of problems.""

In December 2006, seven of the eight cables connected to Taiwan were damaged by an earthquake, disrupting communications in much of Asia. These cables took several months to fully repair.

A repair ship is expected to arrive on Tuesday to the site of the severed cables off the northern coast of Egypt to begin work on the damage. The cable should be repaired within a week of the ship's arrival, Flag Telecom said.

Another repair ship has been notified of the damage near Dubai, on the cable between UAE and Oman. The cause of the damage has not been officially confirmed but is thought to be related to a tanker dragging its anchor along the sea bed.

Egypt's Minister of Communications and Information Technology said that the internet service would be up and running there at about 80% of its usual capacity within 48 hours.

5 March 2024

By David Gritten, BBC News

The severed communications cables reportedly ran under the Red Sea from Saudi Arabia to Djibouti.

Several undersea communications cables in the Red Sea have been cut, affecting 25% of data traffic flowing between Asia and Europe, a telecoms company and a US official say.

Hong Kong-based HGC Global Communications said it had taken measures to reroute traffic after four of the 15 cables were recently severed. The cause is not yet clear.

The US official said it was trying to find out whether the cables were cut deliberately or snagged by an anchor. Last month, Yemen's internationally-recognised government warned that the Iran-backed Houthi movement might sabotage the undersea cables in addition to attacking ships in the sea.

The Houthis - who control much of western Yemen's Red Sea coast - denied last week that they had targeted cables and blamed US and British military strikes for any damage to them.

US and British forces have targeted Houthi weapons and infrastructure in response to the drone and missile attacks on merchant vessels passing through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

The Houthis say their attacks are a show of support for the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

An estimated 25% of traffic was affected, it added, noting that some 80% of the west-bound traffic from Asia passed through the cables.

HGC said it had taken measures to mitigate any disruptions for its clients by rerouting data to Europe through cables in mainland China and under the Pacific Ocean to the US, as well as using the remaining cables in the Red Sea.

A Pentagon official confirmed to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that undersea telecommunications cables in the Red Sea had been cut. The official said the US was still trying to determine whether they were deliberately severed or snagged by a ship's anchor.

Last week, Israeli business website Globes reported that the same four cables running between the Saudi city of Jeddah and Djibouti had been damaged and pointed the blame at the Houthis, without providing any evidence. Sky News Arabia, which is based in the United Arab Emirates, cited unnamed sources as accusing the Houthis of ""blowing up"" the cables.

The Houthis' telecommunications ministry denied those reports. The ministry said it wanted to reaffirm remarks in a recent speech by Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi, who said the group did not want to put any communications cables at risk.

The decision to ""prevent the passage of Israeli ships"" through the Red Sea did ""not apply to ships belonging to international companies licensed to carry out marine work on cables in Yemeni waters"", it added.

Meanwhile, the US military's Central Command said the Houthis had fired two anti-ship ballistic missiles at a Liberian-flagged, Swiss-owned container ship, MSC Sky II, in the Gulf of Aden. One of the missiles hit the vessel, causing damage but no injuries, it added.

Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea claimed that the ship was Israeli and that it would ""continue to prevent Israeli navigation or those heading to the ports of occupied Palestine"".","The article titled ""Crucial Red Sea data cables cut, telecoms firm says"" provides detailed information about the severing of several undersea communications cables in the Red Sea, which has affected 25% of data traffic between Asia and Europe.
